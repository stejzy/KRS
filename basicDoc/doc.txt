Dean Foods Co expects earnings for the
fourth quarter ending May 30 to exceed those of the same
year-ago period, Chairman Kenneth Douglas told analysts.
    In the fiscal 1986 fourth quarter the food processor
reported earnings of 40 cts a share.
    Douglas also said the year's sales should exceed 1.4
billion dlrs, up from 1.27 billion dlrs the prior year.
    He repeated an earlier projection that third-quarter
earnings "will probably be off slightly" from last year's 40
cts a share, falling in the range of 34 cts to 36 cts a share.
    Douglas said it was too early to project whether the
anticipated fourth quarter performance would be "enough for us
to exceed the prior year's overall earnings" of 1.53 dlrs a
share.
    In 1988, Douglas said Dean should experience "a 20 pct
improvement in our bottom line from effects of the tax reform
act alone."
    President Howard Dean said in fiscal 1988 the company will
derive  benefits of various dairy and frozen vegetable
acquisitions from Ryan Milk to the Larsen Co.
    Dean also said the company will benefit from its
acquisition in late December of Elgin Blenders Inc, West
Chicago.

countries access to technology that could further their

technology, technology that is truly critical, we will do a
better job of preventing diversion of critical technology to
our adversaries while promoting more exports," Cranston said.

ChemLawn Corp <CHEM> could attract a
higher bid than the 27 dlrs per share offered by Waste
Management Inc <WNX>, Wall Street arbitrageurs said.
    Shares of ChemLawn shot up 11-5/8 to 29-3/8 in
over-the-counter- trading with 3.8 mln of the company's 10.1
mln shares changing hands by late afternoon.
    "This company could go for 10 times cash flow or 30 dlrs,
maybe 32 dollars depending on whether there is a competing
bidder," an arbitrageur said. Waste Management's tender offer,
announced before the opening today, expires March 25.
    "This is totally by surprise," said Debra Strohmaier, a
ChemLawn spokeswoman. The company's board held a regularly
scheduled meeting today and was discussing the Waste Management
announcement. She said a statement was expected but it was not
certain when it would be ready. 
    She was unable to say if there had been any prior contact
between Waste Management and ChemLawn officials.
    "I think they will resist it," said Elliott Schlang,
analyst at Prescott, Ball and Turben Inc. "Any company that
doesn't like a surprise attack would."
    Arbitrageurs pointed out it is difficult to resist tender
offers for any and all shares for cash. Schlang said ChemLawn
could try to find a white knight if does not want to be
acquired by Waste Management.
    Analyst Rosemarie Morbelli of Ingalls and Snyder said
ServiceMaster Companies L.P. <SVM> or Rollins Inc <ROL> were
examples of companies that could be interested.
    ChemLawn, with about two mln customers, is the largest U.S.
company involved in application of fertilizers, pesticides and
herbicides on lawns. Waste Management is involved in removal of
wastes.
    Schlang said ChemLawn's customer base could be valuable to
another company that wants to capitalize on a strong
residential and commercial distribution system.
    Both Schlang and Morbelli noted that high growth rates had
catapulted ChemLawn's share price into the mid-30's in 1983 but
the stock languished as the rate of growth slowed.
    Schlang said the company's profits are concentrated in the
fourth quarter. In 1986 ChemLawn earned 1.19 dlrs per share for
the full year, and 2.58 dlrs in the fourth quarter.
    Morbelli noted ChemLawn competes with thousands of
individual entrepreuers who offer lawn and garden care sevice.

A surprise 7.5 pct drop in U.S. January
durable goods orders points to a slowdown in capital spending
that could presage lackluster real growth in the U.S. economy

    With total orders, excluding the volatile defense sector,
falling a record 9.9 pct, economists agreed that the report
painted a bleak picture for the U.S. economy.

primary factor behind the drop in orders for business capital
investment.
    "It's a rather gloomy outlook for the economy, said David
Wyss of Data Resources Inc. "I'm particularly impressed by the
19.7 pct drop in non-defense capital goods orders because it
may be a sign that businesses are reacting more adversely to
tax reform than we thought."
    The Commerce Department pointed out that a record 14.8 pct
decline in new orders for machinery was led by declines in
office and computing equipment orders.
    Economists said the drop in computer orders may have been a
response to the lengthening of depreciation schedules and the
end of the investment tax credit under the new tax laws.
    "It's more expensive to invest than it used to be, so
people just aren't doing it as much," Wyss said.
     Increases in durable goods orders at year's end reinforced
the view that businesses anticipated the changing tax laws,
economists said.
    November durable goods orders rose 5.1 pct and December's
increased 1.5 pct, revised upwards from a previously reported
0.9 pct.
    But most acknowledged that the huge January drop was caused
by more than tax reform.
    "The wash-out that took place in January was far greater
than the actual gains that took place in November and
December," said Bill Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. "The
economy has a weakening bent to it early in the year."
    "The report definitely points to very sluggish capital
spending over the next couple of quarters," said Donald Maude
of Midland Montagu Capital Markets Inc.
    Maude pointed to a continuing decline in order backlogs as
evidence that the outlook for new orders is not improving. In
November, order backlogs rose 0.6 pct, but in December they
fell 0.6 pct and in January 0.7 pct, he said.
    "It suggests orders in the pipeline are depleting, which
may quickly translate to a drop in production," Midland
Montagu's Maude said.
    Wyss cautioned that too much should not be made of
January's report, given that other reports have reflected
strength.
    But he acknowledged that the decline occurred despite a 51
pct rise in defense orders, compared with a 57.7 pct decline in
December.
    He also noted that there was a 6.9 pct drop in January
shipments, compared with a 5.4 pct rise in December.
    "Given these numbers, there's no reason for the Fed to
tighten," Data Resources' Wyss said.
    "But there's no reason to ease unless we see more numbers
like this. The Fed will wait and see," he added.
    Sullivan predicted the Fed will ease by Easter. "People
aren't talking recession or Fed easing now, but the Fed will
have to ease to ensure global growth."

Sens. Alan Cranston (D-Cal.) and
Daniel Evans (R-Wash.) said they introduced export licensing
reform legislation that could save U.S. companies hundreds of
thousands of dollars annually.
    "Our emphasis is two-fold: Decontrol and de-license items
where such actions will not endanger our national security, and
eliminate the Department of Defense's de facto veto authority
over the licensing process," Cranston said.
    "Our reforms should reduce licensing requirements by 65  to
70 pct," he told reporters. "I am convinced that a more
rational...licensing process will boost exports."
    U.S. export controls are intended to deny Eastern bloc
countries access to technology that could further their
military capabilities.
    "By refocusing our control resources on higher levels of
technology, technology that is truly critical, we will do a
better job of preventing diversion of critical technology to
our adversaries while promoting more exports," Cranston said.
    "We cannot expect to continue to play a leading role in new
technology development in the future if we unduly restrict the
activities of U.S. firms in the world market-place," Evans told
reporters.

AM International Inc, reporting an
operating loss for the January 31 second quarter, said
prospects for the balance of the fiscal year remain good.
    It said orders at its Harris Graphics subsidiary, acquired
in June 1986, "continue to run at a strong pace." For the six
months, orders rose 35 pct over the corresponding prior-year
period, or on an annualized basis are running at about 630 mln

    The backlog at Harris is up 30 pct from the beginning of
the fiscal year, AM said.
    AM International said its old division are expected to
benefit from recent new product introductions and the decline

    "Research, development and engineering expenditures in
fiscal 1987 will be in the 45-50 mln dlr range, and the company
said it has allocated another 30-40 mln dlrs for capital

The chairmen and senior Republican
members of the House and Senate tax writing committees proposed
legislation to curb estate tax deduction on sales of stock to
an employee stock ownership plan.
    The proposal would raise federal revenues of 6.7 billion
dlrs over the fiscal year period 1987 to 1991.
    If adopted by Congress it would effect all transactions
after Sept 26, 1987.
    The plan was proposed by House Ways and Means Committee
Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill), Rep John Duncan (R-Tenn),
Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex) and Sen
Bob Packwood (R-Ore).
    In a statement Rostenkowski said the estate tax deduction
enacted last year as part of the tax reform bill was too broad
and would have cost the governmet seven billion dlrs over four
years. The narrower deduction would cost the government less
than 300 mln dlrs for the same years.
    He said it was designed to avoid sham transactions which
allowed estates to avoid taxes by transferring stock to ESOPs.
    Senate Finance Committee chairman Lloyd Bentsen said in a
statement, "The Tax Reform Act contains a provision that allows
many wealthy individuals to avoid the federal estate tax
entirely when they die."
    He added, "The provision was intended to encourage estates
to sell stock to employee stock ownership plans as a way of
promoting worker ownership; however, the provision was not
meant to be broad enough to reduce federal revenues as much as
is currently estimated."
    He added, "The bill I have introduced today calls for the
modification of the provision in accordance with its intended
purpose."

U.S. bank discount window borrowings
less extended credits averaged 310 mln dlrs in the week to
Wednesday February 25, the Federal Reserve said.
    The Fed said that overall borrowings in the week fell 131
mln dlrs to 614 mln dlrs, with extended credits up 10 mln dlrs
at 304 mln dlrs. The week was the second half of a two-week
statement period. Net borrowings in the prior week averaged 451
mln dlrs.
    Commenting on the two-week statement period ended February
25, the Fed said that banks had average net free reserves of
644 mln dlrs a day, down from 1.34 billion two weeks earlier.
    A Federal Reserve spokesman told a press briefing that
there were no large single day net misses in the Fed's reserve
projections in the week to Wednesday.
    He said that natural float had been "acting a bit
strangely" for this time of year, noting that there had been
poor weather during the latest week.
    The spokesman said that natural float ranged from under 500
mln dlrs on Friday, for which he could give no reason, to
nearly one billion dlrs on both Thursday and Wednesday.
    The Fed spokeman could give no reason for Thursday's high
float, but he said that about 750 mln dlrs of Wednesday's
float figure was due to holdover and transportation float at
two widely separated Fed districts.
    For the week as a whole, he said that float related as of
adjustments were "small," adding that they fell to a negative
750 mln dlrs on Tuesday due to a number of corrections for
unrelated cash letter errors in six districts around the
country.
    The spokesman said that on both Tuesday and Wednesday, two
different clearing banks had system problems and the securities
and Federal funds wires had to be held open until about 2000 or
2100 EST on both days.
    However, he said that both problems were cleared up during
both afternoons and there was no evidence of any reserve
impact.
    During the week ended Wednesday, 45 pct of net discount
window borrowings were made by the smallest banks, with 30 pct
by the 14 large money center banks and 25 pct by large regional
institutions.
    On Wednesday, 55 pct of the borrowing was accounted for by
the money center banks, with 30 pct by the large regionals and
15 pct by the smallest banks.
    The Fed spokesman said the banking system had excess
reserves on Thursday, Monday and Tuesday and a deficit on
Friday and Wedndsday. That produced a small daily average
deficit for the week as a whole.
    For the two-week period, he said there were relatively high
excess reserves on a daily avearge, almost all of which were at
the smallest banks.

American Express Co remained silent on
market rumors it would spinoff all or part of its Shearson
Lehman Brothers Inc, but some analysts said the company may be
considering such a move because it is unhappy with the market
value of its stock.
    American Express stock got a lift from the rumor, as the
market calculated a partially public Shearson may command a
good market value, thereby boosting the total value of American
Express. The rumor also was accompanied by talk the financial
services firm would split its stock and boost its dividend.
    American Express closed on the New York Stock Exchange at
72-5/8, up 4-1/8 on heavy volume.
    American Express would not comment on the rumors or its
stock activity.
    Analysts said comments by the company at an analysts'
meeting Tuesday helped fuel the rumors as did an announcement
yesterday of management changes.
    At the meeting, company officials said American Express
stock is undervalued and does not fully reflect the performance
of Shearson, according to analysts.
    Yesterday, Shearson said it was elevating its chief
operating officer, Jeffery Lane, to the added position of
president, which had been vacant. It also created four new
positions for chairmen of its operating divisions.
    Analysts speculated a partial spinoff would make most
sense, contrary to one variation on market rumors of a total
spinoff.
    Some analysts, however, disagreed that any spinoff of
Shearson would be good since it is a strong profit center for
American Express, contributing about 20 pct of earnings last
year.
    "I think it is highly unlikely that American Express is
going to sell shearson," said Perrin Long of Lipper Analytical.
He questioned what would be a better investment than "a very
profitable securities firm."
    Several analysts said American Express is not in need of
cash, which might be the only reason to sell a part of a strong
asset.
    But others believe the company could very well of
considered the option of spinning out part of Shearson, and one
rumor suggests selling about 20 pct of it in the market.
    Larry Eckenfelder of Prudential-Bache Securities said he
believes American Express could have considered a partial
spinoff in the past.
    "Shearson being as profitable as it is would have fetched a
big premium in the market place. Shearson's book value is in
the 1.4 mln dlr range. Shearson in the market place would
probably be worth three to 3.5 bilion dlrs in terms of market
capitalization," said Eckenfelder.
    Some analysts said American Express could use capital since
it plans to expand globally.
    "They have enormous internal growth plans that takes
capital. You want your stock to reflect realistic valuations to
enhance your ability to make all kinds of endeavors down the
road," said E.F. Hutton Group analyst Michael Lewis.
    "They've outlined the fact that they're investing heavily
in the future, which goes heavily into the international
arena," said Lewis. "...That does not preclude acquisitions and
divestitures along the way," he said.
    Lewis said if American Express reduced its exposure to the
brokerage business by selling part of shearson, its stock might
better reflect other assets, such as the travel related
services business.
    "It could find its true water mark with a lesser exposure
to brokerage. The value of the other components could command a
higher multiple because they constitute a higher percentage of
the total operating earnings of the company," he said.
     Lewis said Shearson contributed 316 mln in after-tax
operating earnings, up from about 200 mln dlrs in 1985.

Thomson McKinnon Mortgage Assets Corp, a

collateralized mortgage obligations in three tranches that
include floating rate and inverse floating rate CMOS.
    The floating rate class amounts to 60 mln dlrs. It has an
average life of 7.11 years and matures 2018. The CMOs have an
initial coupon of 7.0375 pct, which will be reset 60 basis
points above LIBOR, said sole manager Thomson McKinnon.
    The inverse floater totals 4.8 mln dlrs. It has an average
life of 13.49 years and matures 2018. These CMOs were given an
initial coupon of 11-1/2 pct and priced at 104.40.
    Subsequent rates on the inverse floater will equal 11-1/2
pct minus the product of three times (LIBOR minus 6-1/2 pct).
    A Thomson officer explained that the coupon of the inverse
floating rate tranche would increase if LIBOR declined. "The
yield floats opposite of LIBOR," he said.
    The fixed-rate tranche totals 35.2 mln dlrs. It has an
average life of 3.5 years and matures 2016. The CMOs were
assigned a 7.65 pct coupon and par pricing.
    The issue is rated AAA by Standard and Poor's and secured

OPEC may be forced to meet before a
scheduled June session to readdress its production cutting
agreement if the organization wants to halt the current slide
in oil prices, oil industry analysts said.
    "The movement to higher oil prices was never to be as easy
as OPEC thought. They may need an emergency meeting to sort out
the problems," said Daniel Yergin, director of Cambridge Energy
Research Associates, CERA.
    Analysts and oil industry sources said the problem OPEC
faces is excess oil supply in world oil markets.
    "OPEC's problem is not a price problem but a production
issue and must be addressed in that way," said Paul Mlotok, oil
analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc.
    He said the market's earlier optimism about OPEC and its
ability to keep production under control have given way to a
pessimistic outlook that the organization must address soon if
it wishes to regain the initiative in oil prices.
    But some other analysts were uncertain that even an
emergency meeting would address the problem of OPEC production
above the 15.8 mln bpd quota set last December.
    "OPEC has to learn that in a buyers market you cannot have
deemed quotas, fixed prices and set differentials," said the
regional manager for one of the major oil companies who spoke
on condition that he not be named. "The market is now trying to
teach them that lesson again," he added.
    David T. Mizrahi, editor of Mideast reports, expects OPEC
to meet before June, although not immediately. However, he is
not optimistic that OPEC can address its principal problems.
    "They will not meet now as they try to take advantage of the
winter demand to sell their oil, but in late March and April
when demand slackens," Mizrahi said.
    But Mizrahi said that OPEC is unlikely to do anything more
than reiterate its agreement to keep output at 15.8 mln bpd."
    Analysts said that the next two months will be critical for
OPEC's ability to hold together prices and output.
    "OPEC must hold to its pact for the next six to eight weeks
since buyers will come back into the market then," said Dillard
Spriggs of Petroleum Analysis Ltd in New York.
    But Bijan Moussavar-Rahmani of Harvard University's Energy
and Environment Policy Center said that the demand for OPEC oil
has been rising through the first quarter and this may have
prompted excesses in its production.
    "Demand for their (OPEC) oil is clearly above 15.8 mln bpd
and is probably closer to 17 mln bpd or higher now so what we
are seeing characterized as cheating is OPEC meeting this
demand through current production," he told

The chairman of the Senate Agriculture
subcommittee on credit said the panel will consider a farm
credit rescue package by Easter even if the system and its
regulator do not ask for help by then.
    "We're going to have a bill to markup, I guarantee you,
before the Easter recess," Sen. David Boren (D-Okla.) said.
    Senate Majority leader Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.) wants
recommendations on farm credit presented by April 11, when
Congress is scheduled to break for Easter, Boren said.
    Boren urged the Farm Credit Administration (FCA), the
system's regulator, to quickly make a formal request for aid.
    Under the 1985 Farm credit law passed by Congress, the FCA,
as regulator, is to certify when the system has exhausted all
its capital and needs federal government help.
    However, FCA chairman Frank Naylor said because much of the
system's remaining capital is tied-up in legal action,
he could not technically certify a rescue is needed this year
and perhaps not even in 1988. The other Republican member of
the three-man FCA board, Marvin Duncan, agreed.
    But Boren urged that even if FCA cannot technically certify
aid is needed, it should request help informally.
    "We all know we need a capital infusion," Boren said.
    Boren and the FCA officials spoke at a hearing on the
plight of the farm credit system. Also at the hearing, Brent
Beesely, chief executive of the Farm Credit Council
representing the system, said that at the end of 1986 the
system had only 1.5 billion dlrs in working capital remaining
after losses of 4.6 billion dlrs over the last two years.
    While he did not ask for government aid, Beesley indicated
the situation is serious in some of the 12 system districts.
    "A significant number of banks and associations in the most
economically depressed areas have and will continue to suffer
extraordinary losses," Beesley said.
    Jim Billington, Democratic member of the FCA board, said
the troubles of the system have encouraged the flight of some
one billion dlrs per month from the system as borrowers repay
loans.
    The system's total portfolio shrank to 54.6 billion dlrs by
the end of last year from 66.6 billion the previous year.
    FCA board members said both borrowers and holders of bonds
in the system need to be assured their money is safe. Naylor
suggested the need for a federal assurance to bondholders.
    "The bondholders have no worry at this time," Billington
said.
    Naylor said several proposals for revamping the farm credit
system are circulating. The proposals range from consolidation
of the system into a centralized national lender, to
de-centralizing into semi-independent institutions.
    But He and the system spokesman Beesley were cautious about
proposals for a secondary market on farm loans. Those
proposals would package farm loans for resale to investors.
    Naylor and Beesley said a secondary market set-up outside
the farm credit system would hurt the system. But Beesley said
a secondary market with the farm credit system as its agent
could be developed without Congressional legislation.

The Tower Commission's scathing   
comments on President Reagan's embattled chief of staff Donald
Regan could signal the death knell to his White House tenure,
but the impact of its strong criticism on two other top
officials was less clear.
    Regan has come in for tough criticism for his handling of
Reagan's worst political crisis since details of the covert
arms sales to Iran and diversion of profits to Nicaraguan
rebels first emerged last November.
    But criticism of the roles of Secretary of State George
Shultz and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, who said they
opposed the Iran arms initiative yet failed to end it, had been
muted until the release of the Tower Commission report.
    "Their obligation was to give the president their full
support and continued advice with respect to the program or, if
they could not in conscience do that, to so inform the
president," the report said after a three-month probe.
    "Instead, they simply distanced themselves from the program.
They protected the record as to their own positions on this
issue. They were not energetic in attempting to protect the
president from the consequences of his personal commitment to
freeing the hostages."
    The report saved some of its most scathing language for
Regan, a gruff former Wall Street executive and close personal
friend of Reagan whose autocratic rule in the White House
angered some top Reagan officials and, perhaps more
importantly, Reagan's wife Nancy.
    "More than almost any chief of staff of recent memory, he
asserted personal control over the White House staff and sought
to extend this control to the national security adviser," said
the report.
    Washington analysts said Regan's departure now appeared to
be only a matter of timing. Many expected the president to
announce it when he addresses the nation on the Tower
Commission's findings next week.
    With Regan's departure apparently imminent and Poindexter
and other key figures in the scandal already out of office, the
report's tough criticism of Shultz and Weinberger could turn
the spotlight on their future.
    Senate Republican leader Robert Dole, a key Reagan ally,
told reporters the report disclosed "colossal blunders" and said
people who had not served the president well should step aside,
but he did not specify who should go.
    "It would seem to me that if you don't protect the
president, you don't serve the president well, then you should
move on," the Kansas Republican, a likely presidential candidate
next year, said.
    One Republican strategist said he believed Regan would not
be the only White House official to leave in the near future.

Dow Chemical Co's <DOW> Merrell Dow
Pharmaceuticals Inc unit said a jury found that Bendectin did
not cause the birth defects of a seven-year old boy whose
mother took the drug during pregnancy.
    The anti-nausea drug has been used to treat morning 
sickness and was discontinued in 1983 amid allegations that the
drug caused birth defects.
    Merrell said that to date there have been 12 other trials
involving the drug, 10 in the U.S. and two in West Germany.
    It said verdicts or judgements in favor of the company were
obtained in eight of the trials, one of which included about
1,150 plaintiffs.
    In two trials, Merrell said, verdicts were in favor of the
plaintiffs. In one, it said, the trial judge overruled the
jury's verdict and issued a judgement in favor of the company
and a three judge panel of the Court of Appeals overturned the
trial judge's ruling. Merrell is now awaiting a rehearing of
this case by the full Court of Appeals.
    Of the remaining two trials, one ended in a mistrial and in
the other the jury was unable to reach a verdict.
    At one point about 1700 lawsuits had been filed alleging
the drug caused birth defects, said a company spokesman. He
said about 300 lawsuits are pending.
    Bendectin was first introduced in the early 1950s, and the
Merrell spokesman said a valid application to make and market
the drug is with the Food and Drug Administration should the
company decide it wants to reintroduce it.

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission
(NRC) proposed to ease evacuation standards for nuclear plants,
which could lead the way to the licensing of controversial
plants in New York and New Hampshire.
    The NRC voted 4-1 to offer the rule for 60 days of public
comment before it reconsidered it and set emergency evacuation
standards of its own.
    Local authorites at the plants at Shoreham, Long Island,
N.Y., and Seabrook, N.H., had refused to take part in
evacuation planning, as required under existing NRC rules.
    They had claimed the region was too populated for any safe
evacuation plan, holding up the NRC's authority to issue full
power licenses of the two multi-billon dollar plants.
    A group of prominent politicians, led by New York Governor
Mario Cuomo, charged at a public meeting on the proposed plan
on Tuesday that NRC members were more interested in protecting
the utilties'investments than protecting public safety.
    An NRC spokesman said after the meeting that the agency had
not yet scheduled a meeting to vote on the proposed plan.
    In a statement today announcing its vote, the commission
said the proposed rule change would enable the NRC to act in
cases where local authorities refused to take part in emergency

The sharp decline in soybean crush ratios
seen in the last few weeks, accelerating in recent days, has
pushed margins below the cost of production at most soybean
processing plants and prompted many to cut output of soybean
meal and oil.
    The weekly U.S. soybean crush rate was reported by the
National Soybean Processors Association this afternoon at 21.78
mln bushels, down from the 22 mln bushel plus rate seen over
the past two months when crush margins surged to the best
levels seen in over a year.
    Active soymeal export loadings at the Gulf had pushed
soybean futures and premiums higher, prompting a pick-up in the
weekly crush number.
    However, much of that export demand seems to have been met,
with most foreign meal users now waiting for the expected surge
in shipments of new crop South American soymeal over the next
few months.
    U.S. processors are now finding domestic livestock feed
demand is very light for this time of year due to the milder
than normal winter, so they steadily dropped offering prices in
an attempt to find buying interest, soyproduct dealers said.
    Soybean meal futures have also steadily declined in recent
weeks, setting a new contract low of 139.70 dlrs per ton in the
nearby March contract today.
    "Many speculators down here bought March soymeal and sold
May, looking for no deliveries (on first notice day tomorrow,
which would cause March to gain on deferreds)," one CBT crush
trader said.
    "But they've been bailing out this week because the March
has been acting like there will be a lot delivered, if not
tomorrow, then later in the month," he added.
    As a result of the weakness in soymeal, the March crush
ratio (The value of soyproducts less the cost of the soybeans)
fell from the mid 30s earlier this month to 22.6 cents per
bushel today, dropping over five cents in just the last two
days.
    The May crush ended today just over 17 cents, so no
processors will want to lock in a ratio at that unprofitable
level, the trader said. Hopefully, they will now start to cut
back production to get supplies in line with demand, he added.
    With futures down, processors are finding they must bid
premiums for cash soybeans, further reducing crush margins.
    A central Illinois processor is only making about 30 cents
for every bushel of soybeans crushed at current prices, down
sharply from levels just seen just a few weeks ago and below
the average cost of production, cash dealers said.
    Most soybean processing plants are still in operation, with
little talk of taking temporary down-time, so far. But
processors will start halting production in the next few weeks
it they continue to face unprofitable margins, they added.

Latest Federal Reserve data suggest that
the central bank voted to maintain the existing degree of
pressure on banking reserves at its regular policy-making
meeting two weeks ago, money market economists said.
    "The numbers were a little disappointing, but I think we
can take Mr Volcker at his word when he said that nothing had
changed," said Bob Bannon of Security Pacific National Bank.
    Fed Chairman Paul Volcker told a Congressional committee
last Thursday that the Fed's policy "has been unchanged up to
today."
    Although Volcker's statement last Thursday allayed most
fears that the Fed had marginally tightened its grip on
reserves to help an ailing dollar, many economists still wanted
confirmation of a steady policy in today's data, which covered
the two-week bank statement period ended yesterday.
    This need for additional reassurance was made all the more
acute by the Fed's decision yesterday to drain reserves from
the banking system by arranging overnight matched sale-purchase
agreements for the first time since April of last year,
economists added.
    Today's data showed that the draining action was for a
fairly large 3.9 billion dlrs, economists said.
    "The one thing that caught my eye were the relatively
sizeable matched sales on Wednesday," said Dana Johnson of
First National Bank of Chicago. "But there was a clearly
justified need for them. There was nothing ominous."
    "The Fed couldn't have waited until the start of the new
statement period today. If it had, it would have missed its
(reserve) projections," added Security Pacific's Bannon.
    A Fed spokesman told reporters that there were no large
single-day net miss in reserve projections in the latest week.
    Economists similarly shrugged off slightly higher-than-
expected adjusted bank borrowings from the Fed's discount
window, which averaged 310 mln dlrs a day in the latest week,
compared with many economists' forecasts of about 200 mln.
    For the two-week bank statement period as a whole, the
daily borrowing average more than doubled to 381 mln dlrs from
160 in the prior period.
    "There were wire problems at two large banks on Tuesday and
Wednesday, so I am not too bothered about the borrowings," said
Scott Winningham of J.S. Winningham and Co. The Wednesday
average rose to 946 mln dlrs from 148 mln a week earlier.
    Lending further support to the stable policy view was a
relatively steady federal funds rate of about six pct in the
latest week and persistently high levels of excess reserves in
the banking system, economists said.
    "For the time being, the Fed is following a neutral path,
with fed funds at about six to 6-1/8 pct," said Darwin Beck of
First Boston Corp. "I expect it to continue in that vein."
    "Excess reserves fell but they are still over a billion
dlrs," added First Chicago's Johnson. Banks' excess reserves
averaged 1.03 billion dlrs a day in the latest statement
period, down from 1.50 billion in the previous one.
    After the Fed declined to assign a 1987 target growth range
to the wayward M-1 money supply measure last week, little
attention was paid to a steeper-than-anticipated 2.1 billion
dlr jump in the week ended February 16.
    Looking ahead, economists said the Fed will have to tread a
fine line between the dollar's progress in the international
currency markets and the development of the domestic economy.
    "The market has perhaps exaggerated the dollar's effect on
Fed policy," said First Chicago's Johnson. "Of course, it will
take the dollar into account in future policy decisions but if
the economy is weak, it won't pull back from easing."

Japan is expected to cut the base lending
rate for state financial institutions to 5.5 pct from 6.2 as
part of the recent pact by major industrial nations in Paris,
Finance Ministry sources said.
    They said the cut is based on a revision of the Trust Fund
Bureau Law, which should be approved by parliament on March 3,
abolishing the 6.05 pct minimum interest rate on deposits with
the bureau.
    The bureau channels funds to government financial
institutions for public works and other official uses, they
said.
    The base lending rate for state bodies such as the Japan
Development Bank, People's Finance Corp and the finance
corporations of local public enterprises usually moves in
tandem with long-term prime rates, the sources said.
    However, it was impossible for them to follow the last cut,
to 5.8 pct from 6.2 pct on January 28, because the Trust Fund
Bureau rate was legally set at 6.05 pct.
    The ministry will abolish the minimum rate and introduce a
market-related one to resolve the problem and stimulate the
domestic economy, they said.
    On Tuesday, the ministry allowed long-term bankers to cut
their prime to a record low of 5.5 pct, effective February 28.
The move suggested it had reached agreement with depositors
using the bureau, the postal savings system of the Posts and
Telecommunications Ministry and the Japan welfare annuity of
the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the sources said.
    These ministries are trying to determine which market rates
should be considered when setting the bureau's deposit rate,
the ministry sources said.
    Coupon rates on new 10-year government bonds, minus 0.1
percentage points, is the likeliest choice, they added.

The U.S. Economy continued to expand in
February but at a slower pace than in January, which saw a
spurt of activity, the National Association of Purchasing
Management (NAPM) said in a report.
    The Association's composite survey index dropped to 51.9
pct in February from 55.8 pct in January, the NAPM said. It was
the seventh consecutive month in which this leading indicator
was over 50 pct.
    A reading above 50 pct generally indicates that the economy
is in an expanding phase. One below 50 pct implies a declining
economy.
    The  NAPM report, based on a survey of purchasing managers
at 250 U.S. Industrial companies, also found that the growth
rate in new orders and production slowed in February.
    But production remained vigorous, with more than three
times as many members reporting it better rather than worse.
    Vendor deliveries improved slightly last month, but members
reported that steel supplies were tight as USX Corp gradually
resumed production.
    The same number of members reported inventories were higher
as reported them lower. The NAPM said that had not happened
since August 1984.
    For a sixth straight month, more purchasers reported paying
higher rather than lower prices, this time by a ratio of nine
to one.
    Robert Bretz, chairman of the NAPM's business survey
committee, said: "The economy continued to expand in February,
but at a more subdued rate than in January. The slowing of new
orders should not be significant enough to dampen prospects for
a respectable first quarter."
    The composite index is a seasonally adjusted figure, based
on five components of the NAPM business survey - new orders,
production, vendor deliveries, inventories and employment.

After an onslaught of new paper, fewer
mark eurobonds issues are expected this week, bankers said.
    Most managers said they were planning a low issue volume
for the Bundesbank's two-week bond calendar beginning today.
    "We want to have a week's pause," one manager said.
    Last week borrowings totalled 1.775 billion marks,
including a 300 mln mark private placement for Deutsche Bank.
Issues for all of February rose to nearly five billion marks,
from 3.6 billion in January.
    The heavy volume also meant most borrowers except the very
best addresses were having to accept higher coupons.
    "I think the D-mark market is still good, but only if you
can give a good coupon," another manager said.
    But even some government borrowers were not getting the
best reception for bonds which would have been taken up more
readily under other conditions.
    Of the three mark eurobonds launched on Tuesday alone,
bonds for Den Danske Bank and Iceland were trading outside fees
on Friday, although prices had recovered from initial lows.
    Den Danske's 5-3/4 1992 bond was quoted at midday on Friday
at 97.35/65 compared with its par price, and Iceland's 6-1/2
pct 1997 bond traded at 97.25/75 against a 100-1/4 issue price.
    A 300 mln mark 6-1/8 pct 1997 issue for Nippon Telegraph
and Telephone was also depressed, but traded Friday within fees
at 98.15, 98.50 from its par price.
    Some shorter maturities did better. In contrast to the
10-year NTT and Iceland issues, a five-year six pct bond for
Hoogovens, traded at 98.40/75 from its 99-1/2 price, thanks
mainly to its shorter maturity, dealers said.
    The large amount of paper brought to the market in the last
two months has also led many syndicate managers to complain
about the Bundesbank's present fixed calendar system, which
they say is too inflexible.
    Currently all mark denominated eurobonds have to be
registered with the Bundesbank in the week preceding the
two-week issue period. A bank may decline to issue a bond on
the requested day in the calendar, but then has to wait for the
next calendar period to schedule the bond again.
    Some managers said they would prefer to abolish the system.
    The Bundesbank shortened the reporting period to two weeks
from four weeks last July. But few expect the calendar to be
completely abolished. "I don't think the Bundesbank would give
that up," one banking analyst said.
    "I wouldn't have anything against getting rid of the system,"
the analyst said, adding banks were capable of regulating the
volume of new issues themselves.
    The Bundesbank plays a passive role in setting the calendar
without trying to regulate the issues, but it needs the
registration to gauge the volume of mark bonds going through
the euromarket, he said.
    For this reason, few managers here foresee the Bundesbank
sacrificing its present calendar system.
    Bond activity in West German bond trading and syndication
departments is also expected to be quieter than normal owing to
the carnival holiday.
    Carnival will close banks in Duesseldorf all day on Monday.
In Frankfurt, banks will close on Tuesday in the afternoon.

<Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp>
(NTT) expects its profits to fall to 328 billion yen in the
year ending March 31, 1988 from a projected 348 billion this
year, the company said.
    Total sales for the same period are expected to rise to
5,506 billion yen from a projected 5,328 billion this year, NTT

    NTT said it plans to make capital investments of 1,770
billion yen in 1987/88, including 109 billion for research and
development, as against a total of 1,600 billion this year.
    An NTT spokesman said increased competition from new

major factors behind the projected decrease in profits.

Japanese securities houses will issue new
corporate bonds more quickly, accept issue requests throughout
the month instead of at month-end and introduce a competitive
underwriting method from April 1, to bring Japanese firms back
to the Tokyo bond market, securities managers said.
    Domestic issues have slowed to a trickle as more and more
companies turn to more flexible overseas markets for cash, but
the proposed moves are expected to pave the way for a review of
public bond issues, they said.
    "Relaxation of issue rules would be better applied not only
to straight corporate bonds, but also convertible bonds and
warrant bonds, to call back issuers effectively from overseas
markets," a Nikko Securities house bond manager said.
    Securities houses will launch an issue about 10 days after
a corporate declaration of intent instead of 25 days as now,
the securities managers said.
    Underwriters are expected to abolish the lump-sum issuance
system, in which all corporate bonds are issued at month-end,
and accept issue requests during the month, they said.
    Securities houses also plan to introduce free competition
among underwriters when negotiating with issuers over terms in
order to better reflect the market, securities managers said.
    Market participants expect the new issue methods to be
applied beginning in April, with the projected issue by <Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone Corp>.
    The so-called proposal method abolishes the practice of
taking lead-managership and enables more market-oriented
decisions on terms, securities sources said.
    The four major Japanese securities houses now take turns
underwriting corporate bonds.
    Setting issue terms using financial criteria prepared by
securities houses and in reference to coupon rates on latest
public bonds is now almost automatic, they said.
    The new moves are based on wide-ranging proposals made in
late December by advisers to Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa.
They were aimed at revitalising the domestic corporate bond
market, securities house managers said.
    The finance ministry, commissioned banks and securities
houses agreed in January to lower the eligibility ceiling for
companies wanting to issue non-collateral straight and
convertible bonds from March 1, securities managers said.
    The cut will more than double the number of corporations
able to make non-collateral issues from around 70 for straight
bonds and 180 for convertibles now, securities managers said.
    The Bond Market Committee of the Securities Exchange
Council also recommended introduction of a shelf registration
system, more use of corporate ratings systems and
simplification of disclosure rules to help speed up the issuing
process, securities sources said.
    It also called for a major review of the commissioned bank
system, which increases the cost of issuing domestic bonds, and
for deregulation of private placements, they said.
    Some of these proposals are likely to take some time to put
into effect, the sources said. A shelf registration system
would need a revision of Japanese commercial law, expected in
1988, the sources said.

    The interest rate ceiling of MMCs with maturities of
between one year and two years will be set at 0.5 percentage
point below the prevailing certificate of deposit rate, the

Japanese consumers hesitated about buying
the controversial digital audio tape player (DAT) as it went on
sale in Tokyo today, but said the DAT player's near-perfect
sound will make it a success once it becomes cheaper.
    "The sound is great, but I'll wait until more machines hit
the market and prices fall to about 100,000 yen before buying
one," said Terumi Fujitsuka, 35, a steel firm employee.
    Aiwa, Sharp and Matsushita displayed their DAT players
today although delivery will take about two weeks, retailers
said. Aiwa's machine, the cheapest, is listed at 188,000 yen.
    Machines by Sony, Hitachi, Toshiba and others will appear
as early as the end of March, industry sources said.
    DAT players can play back and record with fidelity superior
to even a compact disc. They use a cassette half the size of
the standard audio cassette and unlike conventional analogue
machines, they can make copies an infinite number of times with
almost no loss of sound quality.
    This aroused fears in the music industry of widespread tape
piracy and loss of royalties. In negotiations that delayed the
DAT player's debut, the industry demanded anti-piracy circuitry
be built into the machines.
    Machines sold in Japan are fitted with a computer chip to
prevent copying through a digital signal. But copies can still
be made if the signal is routed through a regular amplifier.
"Nobody can tell the difference," one salesman said.
    DAT players have been kept off Western markets and some
countries are considering banning them or imposing heavy duties
unless tougher anti-piracy circuitry is added. But Japanese
hardware makers, hard pressed for profits in the era of the
high yen and growing competition, are eager to carve out a
profitable niche.
    Prices of DAT players will probably fall quickly, possibly
to around 70,000 yen by next year as other makers put their
products on the market, industry analysts said.
    They said by 1990, sales could reach six mln units per
year.
    Philips of the Netherlands has said it will launch its DAT
player on the world market later this year.

    The report, based on questions asked of purchasing managers
at 250 U.S. industrial companies, also found that the growth
rate in new orders and production slowed in February.
    However, production remained vigorous as more than three
times as many members reported it better rather than worse.
    Vendor deliveries improved slightly last month, but members
reported that steel supplies were tight as U.S. Steel <X>
gradually resumed production.
    An equal number of members reported inventories were higher
and lower. The NAPM said that had not happened since August
1984.
    For a sixth month, more purchasers reported paying higher
rather than lower prices, this time by a ratio of nine to one.
    Robert Bretz, chairman of the NAPM's business survey
committee and director of materials management at Pitney Bowes
Inc <PBI> said "the economy continued to expand in February,
but at a more subdued rate than in January. The slowing of new
orders should not be significant enough to dampen prospects for
a respectable first quarter."
    The composite index is a seasonally adjusted figure, based
on five components of the NAPM business survey - new orders,
production, vendor deliveries, inventories and employment.

American Express Co, rumored to be
considering a spinoff of part of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc,
said it is studying a range of options for its brokerage unit
that could improve Shearon's access to capital and help it meet
broadening international competition.
    In a joint statement, American Express and Shearson said
the actions under consideration are an integral part of
American Express' worldwide financial services strategy and
that the two companies have been having both internal and
external discussions on the matters.
    American Express said no decision has been reached on the
strategic options and that it and Shearson could ultimately
decide to follow growth plans already in place.
    Last week, rumors circulated on Wall Street that the
financial services giant was considering a spinoff of part of
Shearson and there was speculation it may be considering
selling a stake to a Japanese firm. Analysts said the
speculation also focused on American Express selling 20 pct of
the profitable brokerage firm to the public.
    There was some speculation that American Express had also
considered a total spinoff of Shearson, but the plan was
considered highly unlikely, analysts said.
     American Express said in the statement on Sunday that it
will not comment on rumors and speculation and a spokesman
would not go beyond the statement. The company also remained
silent last Thursday and Friday, as rumors drove American
Express stock up a total of 5-1/2 dlrs in two days to bring it
to a Friday close at 74.
     It said it issued the statement on Sunday because a
similar statement was being circulated to employees.
    Analysts have been divided on whether it makes sense for
American Express to give up a stake in the wholly-owned
brokerage, which improved its after-tax earnings by about 50
pct in the last year.
    Some analysts said American Express may consider spinning
off part of Shearson because it is concerned that its stock
price does not fully reflect the value of the brokerage firm.
     Shearson contributed 316 mln dlrs of American Express'
1.25 billion dlr net in 1986.
    American Express' ambitious plans for international growth
may be also enhanced by the added cash that spinning out part
of Shearson would bring. Analysts speculated that all of
Shearson would have a market value of about 3.5 billion dlrs.
    To some however, the need for added capital is puzzling.
"(American) Express is in a position where they can raise
capital if they need to," said Larry Eckenfelder of
Prudential-Bache Securities.
    Analysts said rumors were fed by the reorganization of
Shearson management Wednesday. Chief operating officer Jeffrey
Lane got the added, previously vacant, post of president.
     The reorganization also created four new positions for
chairmen of Shearson's operating divisions, a move analysts
speculated would allow Shearson to be a stand alone company.
     Analysts, contacted on Sunday said the statement does
little to clarify last week's market speculation. It does
confirm, however, that the financial services firm, which
unsuccessfully attempted to expand Shearson with a major
acquisition last year, is looking beyond its own walls for
growth and positioning in the global market competition.
    Late last year, Shearson's takeover offer to the E.F.
Hutton Group Inc was rejected by Hutton, and analysts said
there had been speculation that Shearson also was rebuffed when
it approached another major Wall Street brokerage.

Apple Computer Inc today will
announce the addition of two new machines to its profitable
Macintosh line of personal computers, both aimed at the
business market.
    The Macintosh was first introduced in January 1984 and has
been upgraded several times since then. Both of the new
machines, the Macintosh SE and the Macintosh II, will be faster
and more versatile, but considerably more expensive than
earlier models.
    The Mac SE (SE stands for "system expansion"), which Apple
says will operate 15-20 pct faster than its current Mac Plus,
goes on sale today. It carries a suggested retail price ranging
from 2,899 to 3,699 dlrs depending on its features.
    The Mac II, designed to run about four times faster than
the Mac Plus, is to be ready for shipping in May and priced
between 4,798 and 6,998 dlrs.
    Mac Plus, which went on the market one year ago, sells for
about 2,200 dlrs.
    Both new computers are to be unveiled at the AppleWorld
Conference in Los Angeles.
    Company officials expressed high hopes for both computers
at a press briefing on Friday, especially the high-performance
Mac II which is designed to give Apple an entree to the
expanding market for science and engineering workstations.
    John Sculley, Apple chairman and chief executive officer,
declined to estimate anticipated sales, but he said the Mac SE
should contribute significantly to Apple's bottom line this
year. He said it would appeal to the mainstream of PC users.
    "I believe the Mac SE will be the product of choice for
most people," he said. "My sense is that it will be a real
power product for revenue."
    Bruce Lupatkin, senior technology analyst with Hambrecht &
Quist in San Francisco, said he had not seen the new computers
but expected the new products to do well.
    "Apple has recognized the need for a convergence of
computer functions into one general all-purpose workstation,"

LL and E Royalty Trust said Louisiana
Land and Exploration Co <LLX>, the working interest owner for
its oil and natural gas properties, is entitled to start
placing all or part of the revenues that would otherwise accrue
to the trust.
    LL and E said Louisiana Land has not yet escrowed any
amounts and will monitor the siutuation to determine the
necessity of doing so.  The trust said "If the working interest
owner does begin to escrow funds, the effect on the royalties
paid to the trust would be significant."  Royalties from the
properties are the trust's only source of income.
    The trust said independent petroleum engineers' preliminary
annual estimates of future net revenues and the discounted
present value of future net revenues from proved oil and
natural gas reserves attributable to properties in which the
trust has an interest are off 64 pct and 56 pct respectively
from those estimated in 1986 due to the drop in oil and natural
gas prices.
    It said, however, that oil and natural gas reserves have
actually increased in physical amount.  The cost estimates
reflect prices and costs only through September 30.
    The trust said using the September figures, the engineers
determined estimated future net revenues to the trust from
total proved reserves of about 57 mln dlrs.  Usingprices
received in January 1987, however, it said the estimate would
have been about 87 mln dlrs.  LL and E noted that there has
been some weakening in prices since January.
    The trust said the most significant portion of the drop in
estimated future revenues cale from the Jay Field in Alabama
and Florida, a fall to seven mln dlrs from 92 mln dlrs in 1986,
as prices recieved from Jay in September were near production
costs after expenses of nitrogen injection.

New Jersey-based overnight messenger
Purolator Courier Corp said it has agreed to be acquired for
about 265 mln dlrs by a company formed by E.F. Hutton LBO Inc
and certain managers of Purolator's U.S. courier business.
    Analysts have said that Purolator has been for sale for
some time. Purolator announced earlier it was mulling a
takeover bid, but analysts wrongly predicted the offer was from
another courier company.
    Hutton LBO, a wholly owned subsidiary of E.F. Hutton Group
Inc, will be majority owner of the company.
    Hutton said the acquiring company, PC Acquisition Inc, is
paying 35 dlrs cash per share for 83 pct of Purolator's stock
in a tender offer to begin Thursday. The rest of the shares
will be purchased for securities and warrants to buy stock in a
subsidiary of PC Acquisition, containing Purolator's U.S.
courier operations.
    If all the shares of Purolator are tendered, shareholders
would receive for each share 29 dlrs cash, six dlrs in
debentures, and a warrant to buy shares in a subsidiary of PC
Acquisition containing the U.S. courier operations.
    Hutton said in the merger shareholders would get 46 mln
dlrs aggregate amount of guaranteed debentures due 2002 of PC
Acquisition and warrants to buy 15 pct of the common stock of
the PC courier subsidiary. Hutton said the company has valued
the warrants at two to three dlrs per share.
    Purolator's stock price closed at 35.125 dlrs on Friday.
While some analysts estimated the company was worth in the mid
30s, at least one said it would be worth 38 to 42 dlrs.
    This follows sales of two other Purolator units. It agreed
recently to sell its Canadian Courier unit to Onex Capital for
170 mln dlrs, and previously sold its auto filters business.
    Purolator retains its Stant division, which makes closure
caps for radiators and gas tanks. A Hutton spokesman said the
firm is reviewing its options on Stant.
    Purolator's courier business has been lagging that of its
U.S. rivals because of the high price it paid in the past
several years to add air delivery to its ground fleet.
    E.F. Hutton will provide 279 mln dlrs of its funds to
complete the transaction. This so-called "bridge" financing
will be replaced later with long-term debt most likely in the
form of bank loans, Hutton said. Hutton LBO is committed to
keeping the courier business, its president Warren Idsal said.
    "Purolator lost 120 mln dlrs over the last two years
largely due to U.S. courier operations, which we believe the
management is turning around. We belive it will be a very
serious competitor in the future," said Idsal.
    William Taggart, chief executive officer of U.S. Courier
division, will be chief executive officer of the new company.
    The tender offer will be conditioned on a minimum of two
thirds of the common stock being tendered and not withdrawn to
the expiration of the offer as well as certain other conditions.
    The offer will begin Thursday, subject to clearances from
the staff of the Interstate Commerce Commission and will expire
20 business days after commencement unless extended.

The U.S. asset-backed debt securities
market, which grew explosively last year, is broadening and
investment bankers say 1987 could see a variety of issuers.
    "It is interesting to note that the first two asset-backed
deals of the year were done by commercial banks," said Anthony
Dub, who heads First Boston Corp's asset-backed group.
    BankAmerica Corp's <BAC> Bank of America unit last week
issued 400 mln dlrs of securities backed by credit card
receivables via sole manager First Boston. Dub said the
offering sold out quickly, mostly to institutional investors.
    The Bank of America offering followed a January 16 issue of
200 mln dlrs of similar debt by RepublicBank Corp's <RPT>
RepublicBank Delaware unit. Goldman, Sachs and Co ran the books
on that deal, with First Boston acting as co-manager.
    However, Dub said the Bank of America securities were more
closely related to the so-called "cars deals" that raced to
market last year than were the RepublicBank securities.
    "The RepublicBank issue was secured by credit card
receivables. In contrast, the Bank of America deal was the
first public offering of credit card receivables because we
used a grantor trust vehicle," he said.
    In a grantor trust, investors buy asset-backed certificates
that represent a specified percentage of an undivided interest
in the trust, analysts explained.
    The Bank of America certificates were issued by California
Credit Card Trust A, which the bank established for that single
purpose, investment bankers pointed out.
    The debt has an average life of 1.79 years and matures in
1992. First Boston gave the issue a 6.90 pct coupon and priced
it at 99.8125 to yield 6.95 pct, or 65 basis points over
comparable Treasury securities. Non-callable for life, the deal
was rated AAA by both Moody's and Standard and Poor's.
    Underwriters away from the syndicate said they believed the
Bank of America deal was priced too aggressively. "AAA-rated
auto paper was trading about 75 basis points over Treasuries
when First Boston priced the deal," one said.
    However, Dub said the offering sold out quickly anyway.
    The First Boston executive attributed this to the deal's
top-flight rating by both agencies, unlike many of last year's
cars deals, which were rated by S and P alone.
    "Investors receive interest only payments for the first 18
months and then interest and principal payments for the
remaining five to seven months," Dub detailed.
    Investment bankers pointed out that because the Bank of
America deal did not pay principal for a year and a half, the
issue had a longer average life than some of the cars deals
that were brought to market late last year.
    The collateral for the trust includes a pool of VISA credit
card receivables, backed by a letter of credit. Bank of America
has about four billion dlrs of credit card receivables, making
it one of the biggest in the U.S., analysts said.
    Last week's deal was Bank of America's second foray into
the young asset-backed securities market, analysts noted.
    In mid-December 1986 Bank of America sold, via California
Cars Grantor Trust 1986-A, 514 mln dlrs of certificates backed
by automobile receivables through Salomon Brothers Inc.
    Upcoming asset-backed issues include 200 mln dlrs of notes
backed by the car leases of Volvo 1986 Lease Finance Corp, a
unit of Volvo Finance North America Inc, via First Boston, and
450 mln dlrs of notes secured by sales contracts of Mack Trucks
Receivables Corp, a unit of Mack Trucks Inc <MACK>, via
Shearson Lehmand Brothers Inc.
    The asset backed market, which began in March 1985, totals
an estimated 11.9 billion dlrs.

and the hiring of temporary employees to replace staffer
employees.
    The guild represents newswriters, editors, desk assistants,

Investor Sumner Redstone, who leads
one of the two groups vying for control of Viacom International
Inc, offered to sweeten his bid for the company by 1.50 dlrs a
share cash and 1.50 dlrs in securities.
    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Redstone, who controls Dedham, Mass.,-based National Amusements
Inc, a theater chain operator, offered to raise the cash
portion of its Viacom offer to 42 dlrs a share from 40.50 dlrs.
    Redstone also raised the face value of the preferred stock
he is offering to 7.50 dlrs from six dlrs.
    The Redstone offer, which is being made through Arsenal
Holdings Inc, a National Amusements subsidiary set up for that
purpose, which also give Viacom shareholders one-fifth of a
share of Arsenal common stock after the takeover.
    Viacom said earlier today it received revised takeover bids
from Redstone and MCV Holdings Inc, a group led by Viacom
management which is competing with Redstone for control of the
company and already has a formal merger agreement with Viacom.
    The company did not disclose the details of the revised
offers, but said a special committee of its board would review
them later today.
    The Redstone group, which has a 19.5 pct stake in Viacom,
and the management group, which has a 5.4 pct stake, have both
agreed not to buy more shares of the company until a merger is
completed, unless the purchases are part of a tender offer for
at least half of the outstanding stock.
    The two rivals also signed confidentiality agreements,
which give them access to Viacom's financial records provided
they keep the information secret.
    In his SEC filing, Redstone, who estimated his cost of
completing the takeover at 2.95 billion dlrs, said Bank of
America is confident it can raise 2.275 billion dlrs.
    Besides the financing it would raise through a bank
syndicate, Bank of America has also agreed to provide a
separate 25 mln dlr for the limited purpose of partial
financing and has committed to provide another 592 mln dlrs,
Redstone said.
    Merrill Lynch, Pierce Fenner and Smith Inc has increased
its underwriting commitment to 175 mln dlrs of subordinated
financing debt for the Viacom takeover, from the 150 mln dlrs
it agreed to underwrite earlier, Redstone said.
    Redstone said his group would contribute more than 475 mln
dlrs in equity toward the takeover.
    The Redstone equity contribution to the takeover would
consist of all of his group's 6,881,800 Viacom common shares
and at least 118 mln dlrs cash, he said.
    The new offer, the second sweetened deal Redstone has
proposed in his month-long bidding war with management, also
contains newly drawn up proposed merger documents, he said.
    Last week, the management group submitted what it called
its last offer for the company, valued at 3.1 mln dlrs and
consisting of 38.50 dlrs a share cash, preferred stock valued
at eight dlrs a share and equity in the new company. Redstone's
previous offer had been valued at 3.2 billion dlrs.

Directors of the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange will meet Wednesday to consider a membership petition
asking the exchange to tighten rules covering trading
activities in the widely-popular Standard and Poor's 500 Stock
Index futures pit, an exchange executive said.
    The petition calls for elimination of dual trading, a legal
practice where traders execute customer orders as well as trade
for their own account.
    But exchange officials noted this practice also provides an
opportunity for a trader to engage in what is called
"front-running", where traders enter orders for their own account
before executing orders for their customers.
    Leo Melamed, CME special counsel, said directors will rule
on the petition on Wednesday, but added that a special S and P
Advisory Committee has been studying S and P 500 futures
trading conditions for the last six months and is expected to
submit a complete list of recommendations within 30 days.
    In addition to a recommendation on dual trading, Melamed
said the special committee will also make suggestions about a
possible automatic order entry and execution system for S and P
500 futures and futures-options and rule changes that would
alleviate congested conditions in the trading pit.
    Melamed said directors are likely to approve the
recommendations of the special committee because "most actions
of the board are in line with committee recommendations."
    CME senior vice president Gerald Beyer said if the board
accepts the member's petition this week, a rule change will be
submitted to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission for
approval.
    If the board does nothing, or rejects the petition request,
a rule change must then be submitted to the exchange membership
for a vote within 15 days, Beyer said.
    Melamed also added that if the petition must be ruled on
before the recommendations from the special committee are made
"it will confuse the issue."
    Not all traders agree on the need to eliminiate or restrict
dual trading.
    Although Jonathan Wolff, senior vice president at Donaldson
Lufkin and Jenrette, noted dual trading is evident on most
exchanges.
    "It's a question of the integrity of the person you do
business with," Wolff said.
    Futures traders who act as brokers, however, maintain that
trading for their own accounts is necessary in order to make up
for errors they inevitably make when filling customer orders in
chaotic futures trading pits.
    "To have an absolute ban on dual trading makes it difficult
for a broker to function because of his errors," said John
Michael, vice president at First Options of Chicago.
    "What it comes down to is the ethics of the people involved,"
he said.
    Furthermore, the competitive nature of futures brokerage
makes front-running risky to a broker's livelihood, he said.
    "If I ever discovered a broker doing it (front-running), or
even suspected him of doing it, I would cut him off," Michael
said.
    An average broker in the Treasury bond futures pit, for
instance, will fill orders for 5,000 to 10,000 contracts a day
at 1.25 dlrs per contract, floor sources said.  Even figuring
what is considered a typical 25 pct loss for errors such
brokerage can be lucrative.
    Front-running by brokers not only runs the market risk of
an adverse price move, but also the risk of losing the
brokerage business, Michael said.

WEDGE Group Inc, a Houston investment

    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
WEDGE, which is owned by Issam Fares, a Lebanese citizen living
in Switzerland, also said it discussed the possibility of
joining with others in its own bid to seek control of AMI.
    WEDGE stressed that it has no current plans to seek control
of AMI, but refused to rule out a takeover try in the future.
    WEDGE said it has had discussions with AMI management,
Pesch, the closely held health care and investment concern
controlled by Chicago physician LeRoy Pesch, and other AMI
shareholders.
    It did not specify in its SEC filing which issues --
selling its AMI stake or joining with others in a takeover try
-- were discussed with which group. But it said the talks did
not produce any agreements or understandings.
    WEDGE said it believes that "some form of restructuring of
AMI and its business would be highly desirable and appropriate
at this time."
    WEDGE, which holds 4.8 mln shares of AMI common stock, said
it plans to hold further talks with company management, Pesch
and other shareholders.
    Pesch last week sweetened his bid for the company to 22
dlrs a share in cash and securties, or 1.91 billion dlrs based
on AMI's total outstanding, from an all-cash 20 dlr a share
bid, which the company rejected.

for the Canadian coast guard, Transport Minister John Crosbie

    In a Vancouver address, Crosbie said Versatile Pacific
Shipyards Inc was the low bidder to build the Arctic Class 8
icebreaker, but the company must meet certain financial and
engineering conditions before the contract is awarded.
    The government also announced it will provide up to 13 mln
dlrs in loan insurance to help Versatile prepare for the
construction of the vessel.
said before the contract can be awarded Versatile "will be
required to offer assurances that the shipyard is technically
and financially capable of performing the work."
    Crosibie said Versatile's bid was 100 mln dlrs lower than
competing bidders and will generate 1,000 person years of
direct employment.
    Work on the vessel, which Crosbie said would be the most
powerful icebreaker in the world, would begin next year and
completed in 1992.
    The government announced plans to build the icebreaker last
year following the controversial passage of the U.S. Coast
Guard's vessel, the Polar Sea, through the disputed Northwest
Passage. The U.S. government did not seek permission for the
journey, claiming the area was an international water way.

five years as we have had in the past," Ziering said.
    Over the past five years Ziering said the company has had
average compound net income growth of 32 pct annually with a 27
pct per year growth in earnings per share. For 1986 the company
had net income of 6.3 mln dlrs, or 1.07 dlrs per share, vs 3.9
mln dlrs, or 73 cts per share in 1985.
    Diagnostic manufactures medical immunological diagnostic
test kits.
    Ziering said he expects the earnings growth to result from
positive effect of the weaker dollar on the company's exports
sales as well as accelerated market penetration. Ziering said
he expected the Food and Drug Administration to approve three
more of its drug abuse test kits by the end of the year, which,
depending on approval, should also help earnings growth.
    Ziering said as a result of the new tax laws he expected
the company's taxes to decrease by five pct to 31 pct of net
income in 1987.

Currency fluctuations may reassert their
influence on the bullion market in the near future, bullion
bankers Samuel Montagu and Co Ltd said in a market report.
    But the firm said silver may lag behind gold in any
reactions to movements on foreign exchanges.
    "OPEC's failure to address the recent decline in oil prices
remains a worrying factor however, and on balance it appears
that the market should be approached cautiously," Montagu said.
    The bank said the US economy has shown no noticeable
long-term improvement and that both Latin American debt and the
Iranian arms affair could undermine confidence in the dollar.

The New York Mercantile Exchange set
April one for the debut of a new procedure in the energy
complex that will increase the use of energy futures worldwide.
     On April one, NYMEX will allow oil traders that do not
hold a futures position to initiate, after the exchange closes,
a transaction that can subsequently be hedged in the futures
market, according to an exchange spokeswoman.
    "This will change the way oil is transacted in the real
world," said said Thomas McKiernan, McKiernan and Co chairman.
    Foreign traders will be able to hedge trades against NYMEX
prices before the exchange opens and negotiate prices at a
differential to NYMEX prices, McKiernan explained.
     The expanded program "will serve the industry because the
oil market does not close when NYMEX does," said Frank Capozza,
secretary of Century Resources Inc.
     The rule change, which has already taken effect for
platinum futures on NYMEX, is expected to increase the open
interest and liquidity in U.S. energy futures, according to
traders and analysts.
    Currently, at least one trader in this transaction, called
an exchange for physical or EFP, must hold a futures position
before entering into the transaction.
    Under the new arrangement, neither party has to hold a
futures position before entering into an EFP and one or both
parties can offset their cash transaction with a futures
contract the next day, according to exchange officials.
    When NYMEX announced its proposed rule change in December,
NYMEX President Rosemary McFadden, said, "Expansion of the EFP
provision will add to globalization of the energy markets by
providing for, in effect, 24-hour trading."
    The Commodity Futures Trading Commission approved the rule
change in February, according to a CFTC spokeswoman.

A bidding war for Viacom International
Inc, one of the largest U.S. entertainment companies, pitted a
management group and other investors against National
Amusements Inc, a closely held theater operator.
    Both sides raised their bids over the weekend. A source
close to the management side insisted that timing was on his
side. He said if outside directors approve the management
proposal, a merger plan could be put to a vote of shareholders
with proxy material going out late this week. "It would take 20
days from the day we mail," said the source.
    The source predicted National Amusements, controlled by
investor Sumner Redstone, would need "half a year" to complete
a tender offer because of the regulatory approvals that must
accompany any change in control of Viacom's broadcast licenses
and cable television franchises.
    Redstone was not available for comment.
    Some of Wall Street's arbitrage players said it was a rare
situation that could only be enjoyed - a true bidding war. One
said Redstone could begin a tender offer whenever he wanted and
if enough people were convinced his proposal was superior to
the Viacom management plan, he would have a chance to win.
    The independent directors of Viacom were called into a
meeting today. Word on a decision was expected early tomorrow.
    Viacom shares climbed 2-1/2 to 50-3/8 by midafternoon. One
major Wall Street firm issued a sell recommendation. "We think
we're at the end now, in terms of bidding," said the firm's
arbitrageur, who spoke on condition he not be identified.
    Both Redstone's proposal and the management proposal would
create a restructured company heavily leveraged with debt. The
management plan would result in a balance sheet with about 2.5
billion dlrs in debt and nearly 500 mln dlrs in preferred
stock, convertible into 45 pct of the common stock.
    Redstone's newest proposal offers holders 42 dlrs in cash,
a fraction of a share of exchangeable preferred stock with a
value of 7.50 dlrs, and one-fifth of a share of common stock
stock of Arsenal Holdings, representing 20 pct of the equity
interest in the restructured Viacom. One arbitrageur calculated
the equity in the Redstone plan was worth 2.50 dlrs making the
total package worth 52 dlrs per share.
    Management offered 38.50 dlrs in cash, exchangeable
preferred stock worth 8.50 dlrs and a fractional share of
convertible preferred. The arbitrageur said the equity portion
was worth about 4.00 dlrs for a total of 51 dlrs.
    Redstone's newest plan raised the amount of interest he
would pay on the cash portion of his offer for every day beyond
April 30 that a merger with Arsenal is not consummated. The
plan calls for intest to be paid at an annual rate of nine pct
during May and 12 pct thereafter. Previously Redstone offered
eight pct interest.
    Other arbitrageurs said both Redstone and the management
group, led by president and chief executive Terrence Elkes,
were offering high prices. "Redstone really wants to own the
company," one said. Another said management seemed to have the
edge on the timing issue.
    Redstone's company owns 19.6 pct ov Viacom's 35 mln shares.
    A Wall Street analyst said it was hard to determine what
the equity in the newly leveraged company would be worth. He
noted as an example that new stock in FMC Corp <FMC>, which
adopted a highly leveraged structure last year, inititally
traded at 12.50 dlrs per share, dipped to nine dlrs, and is now
just over 30 dlrs.
    Last week, Viacom reported fourth quarter earnings fell two
two cts per share from 23 cts. The company said interest costs
from several acquisitions affected results.
    Shares of Warner Communications Inc <WCI> rose 7/8 to
31-1/8. Analysts noted Warner owns warrants to purchase 3.25
mln Viacom shares at 35 dlrs and another 1.25 mln shares at
37.50 dlrs.
    Chris Craft Industries <CCN>, which owns a stake in Warner,
rose 1-1/4 to 22-3/4.
    Viacom was created in 1970 and spun off from CBS Inc <CBS>.
The company has 940,000 cable television subscribers, operates
nine satellite television services and owns television and
radio stations. It is one of the largest distributors of films
and other programs for television.

Marvin Warner and two fellow officers
of the former Home State Savings Bank were convicted on charges
connected with the collapse of Home State.
    Warner, the owner of Home State, was found guilty of six
counts of performing unauthoriazed acts -- investing some Home
State money without authorization from the board of directors
-- and three counts of securities violations in the 1985
collapse. He was acquitted on 76 counts of willful
misapplication.
    Burton Bongard, former Home State president, was convicted
of all 81 counts willful misapplication. David Schiebel, also a
former president, was convicted on three of four counts of
securities violations but was acquitted on 84 charges of
willful misapplication. -- corrects warner's conviction
    The irregularities in which the men were charged led to a
state-imposed moratorium on all state-insured savings and loan
companies in Ohio, which was lifted on an individual basis as
the firms were able to show proof of their solvency.
    Judge Richard Niehaus of Hamilton County Common Pleas Court
ordered Warner jailed in lieu of 3.5 mln dlrs bond. He set a
1.5 mln dlr bond for Bongard and 25,000 dlr bond for Schiebel
pending the appearance of the trio for sentencing March 30.
    Lawrence Kane, special prosecutor, said that Warner and
Bongard could receive a maximum of 15 years in prison. He said
that Schiebel could receive a maximum of 5 to 6 years on his
convictions.
    All three were accused in the draining of 144 mln dlrs of
Home State funds through investments with ESM Government
Securities Inc. of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., which went bankrupt
and triggered the collapse of Home State.
    On March 5, 1985, Ohio Governor Richard Celeste closed all
of the state's privately-insured savings and loan companies and
they remained closed until they could obtain federal deposit
insurance or merge with other companies which had federal

Several analysts said they do not
believe another suitor will top the 265 mln dlr bid for
Purolator Courier Corp by E.F. Hutton LBO Inc and a management
group from Purolator's courier division.
    There had been speculation another offer might be
forthcoming, but analysts mostly believe the 35 dlrs per share
price being paid by Hutton and the managers' PC Acquisition Inc
is fully valued.
    Analysts and some Wall Street sources said they doubted
another bidder would emerge since Purolator had been for sale
for sometime before a deal was struck with Hutton Friday.
    Purolator's stock slipped 3/8 today to close at 34-3/4. It
had been trading slightly higher than the 35 dlr offer on
Friday. At least one analyst Friday speculated the company
might fetch 38 to 42 dlrs per share.
    analysts and wall street sources doubted a competitive
offer would emerge since the company has been for sale for
sometime before the deal with Hutton was struck Friday.
    Hutton had been in talks with Purolator's adviser, Dillon,
Read and Co since late December, a Hutton spokesman said.
    Hutton is offering 35 dlrs cash per share for 83 pct of the
shares. If all shares are tendered, shareholders would receive
29 dlrs cash, six dlrs in debentures, and warrants for stock in
a subsidiary of PC Acquisition containing the Purolator U.S.
courier operation. Hutton values the warrants at two to three
dlrs per share.
    Wall Street sources also said today that a rival bidder
might be discouraged by a breakup fee Purolator would have to
pay if it ends its agreement with Hutton. The sources would not
reveal the amount of the fee, which will be noted in documents
on the transaction to be made public later this week.

Kidder, Peabody Mortgage Assets Trust
Five, a unit of Kidder, Peabody and Co Inc, is offering 500 mln
dlrs of collateralized mortgage obligations in seven classes,
including floating-rate and inverse-rate tranches.
    Sole manager Kidder Peabody said the first floating-rate
class has an initial rate of 6.755 pct that will be reset
quarterly at 40 basis points over three-month LIBOR, with an 11
pct cap.
    Totaling 53.3 mln dlrs, this floating-rate class contains a
so-called catchup provision that allows investors to recapture
possible lost interest, according to Kidder Peabody.
    For instance, if three-month LIBOR rises to 15 pct during
the life of the floating-rate tranche and falls back below the
11 pct cap, investors would be paid back, dollar for dollar,
the amount of interest they would have received if the CMOs did
not carry a maximum interest rate, a Kidder officer said.
    Kidder Peabody introduced this concept on February 12.
    The other floating-rate class totals 132.4 mln dlrs and has
an initial rate of 6.975 pct that will be reset quarterly at 60
basis points over three-month LIBOR, with a 13 pct cap. This
tranche does not have a catch-up provision, the Kidder officer
said.
    The inverse-rate tranche totals 71.3 mln dlrs and has an
initial rate of 10.903 pct. The rate will be reset quarterly
according to the formula of 22.44027 minus the product of
1.8097 times three-month LIBOR.
    Yields on the remaining fixed-rate CMOs, the balance of the
500 mln dlr issue, range from 7-1/4 to 9.27 pct, or 90 to 160
basis points over comparable Treasuries.
    The issue is rated a top-flight AAA by Standard and Poor's.

according to the exchange.
    The maximum daily price limit will be two cts a gallon on
all contracts except spot. Trading will terminate on the last
business day of the month preceding the delivery month.
    The exchange said delivery will be F.O.B from the seller's
pipeline, storage, or fractionation facility in Mont Belvieu,
Texas, which has a direct pipeline access to the Texas Eastern
Transmission Pipeline (TET) in Mont Beliview.
    Delivery method will be by in-line or in-well transfer,

French industry is failing to produce the
goods its markets need and its loss of competitiveness has left
the government little room for manoeuvre to reflate the
economy, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and
Development said.
    With gross domestic product likely to grow only 2.1 pct
this year, the same rate as last year, unemployment could climb
to 11.5 pct of the workforce by mid-1988, from its present 10.9
pct, it said in an annual review of the French economy.
    The report said the French economy was "increasingly
ill-adapted to demand" selling goods at "uncompetitive relative
prices on both domestic and export markets."
    "France's poor export performance reflects a geographical
bias in favour of markets less dynamic than the average...
And...A substantial loss of market share...In the past 18
months," it said.
    Pointing to a likely widening of the French trade deficit
to around 2.9 billion dlrs this year from 2.4 billion in 1986,
it warned that a further depreciation of the dollar against the
franc could lead to "a (renewed) loss of competitiveness
relative not only to the United States but also to the newly
industrialised countries."
    This could result in further major losses of market share,
particularly in the non-OECD area, which accounts for almost a
quarter of French exports, it said.
    Until the competitive ability of industry improved, the
authorities would have "little scope for macroeconomic
manoeuvre, even if the unemployment situation or the need to
encourage a pickup in investment could require demand to grow
more briskly," it added.
    But rising unemployment could help to hold down wage
demands, contributing to a slowdown in inflation to around a
two pct annual rate this year and early next, the OECD said.
    Written mainly in December last year, the report took no
account of a rise in oil prices early in 1987, and a 0.9 pct
surge in January consumer prices, caused partly by the
government's deregulation of service sector tariffs.
    "We took a bet that the freeing of prices would not provoke
runaway rises, and it is not absolutely certain that bet has
been lost," one OECD official commented.
    OECD officials said the January data and a rise in oil
prices above the 15 dlrs a barrel average assumed in the
report, indicated an upward revision in the inflation forecast
to around 2.5 or three pct.
    The government last week revised its forecast up to between
2.4 and 2.5 pct from two pct, against last year's 2.1 pct.
    But the OECD backed the government's view that the
underlying trend for inflation remained downwards this year,
with a slowdown in domestic costs taking over from last year's
fall in oil and commodity prices as the chief cause of
disinflation.
    With French unit productivity costs now among the lowest in
the OECD area, the inflation differential between France and
its main trading rival, West Germany, could fall to just one
pct this year, it said.
    On the other hand, the report noted, consumer prices for
industrial goods and private services have been rising steeply
as companies built up their profits.
    "For the disinflationary process to continue , and price
competitiveness to become lastingly compatible with exchange
rate stability, it is essential that wage restraint continue,"
it said.

The federal Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) is looking for possible securities laws
violations in connection with an unsuccessful 1986 bid by
Hollywood producer Burt Sugarman to take over TRE Corp,
attorneys contacted by SEC investigators said.
    During the takeeover attempt, a unit of Sugarman's Giant
Group Ltd at one point held a 9.9 pct stake in TRE.
    It had help in that effort from Jefferies Group Inc, a Los
Angeles investment banking firm which sold it an option on a
portion of the shares Sugarman eventually acquired.
    In addition, a company controlled by Sugarman raised 35 mln
dlrs in a debt offering underwritten by Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc with help from Jefferies, and used a portion of the
proceeds to buy TRE stock.
    Finally, Reliance Group Holdings Inc acquired nearly six
pct of TRE, according to an SEEC filing.
    The attorneys, who asked not to be identified, said the SEC
was investigating whether Sugarman and other firms with TRE
holdings were working together without disclosing their
cooperation, as would be required by the federal securities

Last week's White House shake-up has
increased the odds that Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul
Volcker, a symbol of strength in a government reeling from the
arms-to-Iran scandal, will serve a third term, sources close to
the Fed say.
    But they said that no decision on the appointment, which
must be filled this August, has been taken by the White House
and Volcker too has not made up his mind.
    Former White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan, who
resigned last week when ex-senator Howard Baker was named as
his replacement, was implacably opposed to Volcker and tried
often to undermine him.
    It is an open secret in Washington that Regan tried to
ensure that Volcker, first appointed in 1979 by President
Carter, will not be offered a third term by President Reagan.
    Only Volcker's key allies in the Reagan administration,
Vice-President George Bush and Treasury Secretary James Baker,
kept Regan's recent maneuvering at bay, the sources said.
    Sources close to the administration say Regan leaked a
story, quickly shot down by others in the administration, that
Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of the council of economic advisers,
had been chosen to replace Volcker.
    But as the administration's credibility was increasingly
under fire, it became clear that Regan's power to bring about
such changes was on the wane.
    The sources said New White House Chief of Staff Howard
Baker has a very good relationship with his namesake at the
Treasury Department and is likely to respect his views on the
Fed chairmanship.
    As a moderate Republican, Baker is also unlikely to share
the right-wing's opposition to Volcker.
    "This new White House is going to need all the strength it
can get," said one source when asked about the possibility of
Volcker's reappointment.
    Paul Volcker is deeply respected in financial markets both
in the United States and around the world. At a time when the
stability of the dollar and the viability of major debtor
nations are in question, Volcker's departure would definitely
undermine U.S. leadership, foreign exchange analysts say.
    U.S. officials say Volcker works very closely with Treasury
Secretary Baker on issues like international debt and global
economic cooperation.
    The two men seem only to differ on how far to deregulate
the banking industry, but recent statements by Volcker, in
which he adopted a more liberal attitude on deregulation,
signalled the politically-independent central bank is coming
around at least partially to the Treasury position.
    And a recent statement by a Reagan administration official
that the two men saw "exactly eye-to-eye" on the dollar was seen
as an indication of Baker's support for the Fed chairman.
    Baker is understood to have played a key role in Volcker's
reappointment to the Fed in mid-1983.
    The sources said Baker respects Volcker and when appointed
Treasury Secretary in February 1985, he decided to ensure a
good working relationship, in part because he believed the two
key government economic institutions have to work closely.
    Regan, Treasury Secretary during President Reagan's first
term, was formerly head of Wall Street's largest brokerage firm
Merrill Lynch and came to Washington determined to be America's
pre-eminent economic spokesman.
    He developed a deep antipathy for Volcker, whose political
skills undermined that ambition, and who financial markets took
much more seriously.
    But the sources said Volcker would have to be invited to
stay. "Is the president going to ask him? he wouldn't stay
otherwise," said one. "He'd have to be asked," said Stephen
Axilrod, formerly staff director of monetary policy at the Fed
and now vice-chairman of Nikko Securities Co. International.
    Otherwise, the list of potential candidates is not
awe-inspiring. And if Volcker left this Augsut, he would leave
behind one of the most inexperienced Fed Boards in years.
    Many analysts believe this lack of collective experience --
the four sitting members were all appointed within the last
three years -- is dangerous, coming at a time when the global
economy is threatened by instability.
    An experienced successor, therefore, would seem a
necessity. One widely mentioned possibility is Secretary of
State George Shultz, whose experience as Treasury Secretary
under Preesident Nixon and background as a trained economist
would make him ideal.
    But Shultz too may have been damaged by the arms-to-Iran
scandal, while vice-chairman Manuel Johnson is regarded at 37
years old as too young for the job.
    Other potential candidates include economist Alan
Greenspan, frequently an informal presidential economic
adviser, New York Fed President E. Gerald Corrigan, Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp chairman William Seidman, and Sprinkel.
    Long a Regan protege, Sprinkel's chances may be damaged by
his patron's departure from the White House.

Contracting for future construction
work declined by three pct in January to an annualized rate of
236.1 billion dlrs, a report on the industry said.
    The report by the F.W. Dodge Division of McGraw-Hill
Information Systems Co said a 10 pct reversal of nonbuilding
construction was largely responsible for the month's setback
from December's higher level.
    Residential building eased three pct in January, while
contracts for commercial, industrial and institutional
buildings rebounded slightly, according to the report.
    Nonbuilding construction, which soared to an annualized
rate of 47.8 billion dlrs in December when last year's only
major electric power plant was started, fell back 10 pct to
43.1 billion.
    Dodge said contracting for highway and bridge construction
advanced five pct in January. However, available funding for
1987 construction could dry up if Congress fails to act after
the Federal highway program runs out of carryover spending
authority.
    Nonresidential buildings edged up one pct in January to an
annualized rate of 77.6 billion. Contracting for institutional
structures, such as schools and health facilities, was the
reason for the gain, the report said.
    Residential building was valued at 115.4 billion dlrs in
January, a decrease of three pct from December's seasonally
adjusted rate, the report stated. However, demand will be
strong for single-family units supported by falling mortgage
rates, but multi-family buildings will not be in high demand as
a result of the tax reform, according to the report.

Japan's seasonally adjusted unemployment
rate rose to a record 3.0 pct in January, the worst since the
Government started compiling unemployment statistics under its
current system in 1953, up from the previous record 2.9 pct in
December, the government's Management and Coordination Agency
said.
    Unemployment was up from 2.8 pct a year earlier.
    Unadjusted January unemployment totalled 1.82 mln people,
up from 1.61 mln in December and 1.65 mln a year earlier.
    Male unemployment in January remained at 2.9 pct, equal to
the second-worst level set last December. Record male
unemployement of 3.1 pct was set in July 1986.
    Female unemployment in January remained at 3.0 pct, equal
to the record level marked in April, August, September and
December last year.
    January's record 3.0 pct unemployment rate mainly stemmed
from loss of jobs in manufacturing industries, particularly in
export-related firms, due to the yen's continuing appreciation
against the dollar, officials said.
    Employment in manufacturing industries fell 380,000 from a
year earlier to 14.30 mln including 1.83 mln employed in the
textile industry, down 190,000 from a year earlier, and 1.06

Japan's unemployment rate is expected to
continue to climb to about 3.5 pct within the next year from
January's three pct record, senior economists, including Susumu
Taketomi of Industrial Bank of Japan, said.
    December's 2.9 pct was the previous worst level since the
government's Management and Coordination Agency began compiling
statistics under its current system in 1953.
    "There is a general fear that we will become a country with
high unemployment," said Takashi Kiuchi, senior economist for
the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd.
    The government, which published the January unemployment
figures today, did not make any predictions.
    "At present we do not have a forecast for the unemployment
rate this year, but it is difficult to foresee the situation
improving," a Labour Ministry official said.
    Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the government had
expected the increase and had set aside money to help 300,000
people find jobs in fiscal 1987 beginning in April.
    Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone told a press conference
the record rate underlines the need to pass the 1987 budget
which has been held up by opposition to proposed tax reforms.
    The yen's surge has caused layoffs in the mainstay steel
and shipbuilding industries. Other export-dependent industries,
such as cars and textiles, have laid off part-time employees
and ceased hiring, economists said.
    Although the growing service industry sector has absorbed a
great number of workers the trend is starting to slow down,
said Koichi Tsukihara, Deputy General Manager of Sumitomo Bank
Ltd's economics department.
    However, other economists disagreed, saying the service
sector would be able to hire workers no longer needed by the
manufacturing sector over the next five years.
    The economists said the service sector should grow as the
government stimulates domestic demand under its program to
transform the economy away from exports.
    Although Japanese unemployment rates appear lower than
those of other industrialised nations, methods for calculating
statistics make them difficult to compare, economists warned.
    "The three pct figure  could translate into a relatively
high figure if European methods were used," one economist said.
More than half of January's 170,000 increase in jobless from a
year earlier were those aged between 15 and 24, Sumitomo's
Tsukihara said.

Fisons Plc <FISN.L> said strong
international growth had been the main feature of the group's
1986 progress, with the pharmaceutical division reporting a 50
pct increase in U.S. Sales during the period.
    The rise was due to a sustained marketing programme, a
larger sales force and the introduction of an aerosol form of
its Intal anti-asthma drug, which pushed U.S. Sales up 70 pct.
    The company was commenting on 1986 results which saw
pre-tax profits rising to 85.1 mln stg from 72.3 mln in 1985.
The result was in line with market forecasts, but its shares
nevertheless eased in a falling market to 634p at 0857 GMT from
643p.
    Fisons said the potential for future growth of Intral, as
well as its Opticrom and Nasalcrom products, was clearly

    The scientific equipment business had raised the proportion
of high technology products it manufactures and also raised its
ability to generate higher margins. The horticulture operations
had demonstrated outstanding marketing ability. Underlying cash
flow from all three operations had been positive despite a full

The Federation of Bankers' Associations of
Japan released its proposal for early creation of a
comprehensive financial futures market in Tokyo.
    The market should include a comprehensive range of futures
and options trading so Tokyo can develop into a real global
money centre where a variety of risk-hedging instruments is
available, the proposal said.
    It should provide currency and interest rate futures, and
incorporate the existing yen bond futures and planned stock
index futures contracts.
    The proposal said transactions in all these contracts must
be conducted on the same market so participants can readily
engage in arbitrage between various financial instruments.
    To make this possible, the proposal calls for new
legislation which would administer all related futures and
options transactions under the same legal framework.
    Banking sources said they expect that initially the
currency futures would be dollar-yen and interest futures would
include Japanese domestic yen certificates of deposit,
three-month Eurodollar deposits and 20-year U.S. Treasury
bonds.
    Banking sources quoted federation chairman Yoshiro Araki as
saying he hoped the market would be created as soon as possible
because it would help promote the liberalisation of Japan's
financial markets.
    Araki said he had no intention of limiting prospective
market participants to banks but was willing to accept those
from wider business circles, the sources said.
    Japan's only current financial futures market, in yen
bonds, began on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in October 1985.

Early dollar straight eurobond trade was
quiet with currency sectors, particularly eurosterling,
continuing to perform strongly, closely reflecting current
trading patterns on the foreign exchanges, dealers said.
    Eurosterling bonds continued to rise steadily, bolstered by
the extremely ebullient tone of the U.K. Government bond market
on a combination of positive U.K. Economic fundamentals.
    The dollar was initially stabler but most dollar straight
bonds were static in dull trade. A handful of issues showed
signs of weakness but dealers said investors were awaiting
today's release of U.S. Leading indicators for January.
    The U.S. Data due out this afternoon is expected to be
weak, placing the U.S. Unit under renewed pressure and robbing
the market in dollar-denominated eurobonds of fresh trading
impetus, one dollar straight trader said.
    "It's going to be another tedious day and I can't see how
anybody is going to make any money," he said.
    Eurosterling issues continued to rally on the back of
general sterling euphoria -- with the U.K. Currency trading at
six month highs on interest rate optimism and the strength of
the domestic equity markets.
    Eurosterling bonds saw early gains of up to half a point.
    However, some eurosterling dealers noted the bonds could
soon fall back marginally if -- as expected -- professionals
stepped in to take profits at current healthy levels.
    Trade in mark-denominated bonds was expected to be subdued
today due to pre-Lenten carnival festivities in West Germany.
    There were signs of reawakened investor nerves affecting

pct.
    The other issue was a 100 mln dlr deal -- also due 1992 --
for NV Nederlandse Gasunie paying 7-1/4 pct and priced at
101-1/8 pct, with Citicorp Investment Bank Ltd as lead manager.
    Dealers predicted reasonable demand for both issues due
mainly to a lack of fresh, good name paper in the market.

The Bundesbank is unlikely to change
its credit policies at its central bank council meeting on
Thursday, as exchange rates and short-term interest rates have
stabilized over the past few weeks, money market dealers said.
    Attention in the money market is focused on tomorrow's
tender for a securities repurchase pact, from which funds will
be credited on Thursday, when an earlier pact expires, draining
16 billion marks from the system.
    The tender was announced last Friday, because carnival
festivities closed banks in Duesseldorf yesterday, and will
close banks here this afternoon.
    Because of the disruption to business from carnival,
minimum reserve figures for the start of the month are
unrealistic, making it difficult for banks to assess their
needs at the tender.
    Dealers said the Bundesbank would want to inject enough
liquidity in this week's pact to keep short-term rates down.
    But because of uncertainty about banks' current holdings,
the Bundesbank may well allocate less than 16 billion marks
this week, and top it up if necessary at next week's tender.
    "I would not be surprised if the Bundesbank cuts the amount
a little, to say 14 or 15 billion marks," one dealer said.
    "They would then stock it up at the next tender when the
need is clearer," he added.
    An earlier pact expires next week, draining 8.5 billion
marks from the system. Banks also face a heavy but temporary
drain this month from a major tax deadline for customers.
    Banks held 52.0 billion marks on February 27 at the
Bundesbank, averaging 51.0 billion over the whole month, just
clear of the 50.5 billion February reserve requirement.

Britain's gold and currency reserves
showed an underlying rise of 287 mln dlrs in February, after a
72 mln dlrs rise in January, the Treasury said.
    The underlying trend, which is a guide to Bank of England
operations to support the pound on foreign exchanges, is net of
borrowings and repayments.
    This was above market expectations for a 100 mln dlrs rise.
    The Treasury said the Bank of England used the opportunity
of strong demand to rebuild reserves after losses last autumn
and said the underlying rise was still relatively modest.
    Actual reserves rose by 305 mln dlrs in February to 22.26
billion dlrs, after rising 29 mln in January to 21.95 billion.
    Accruals of borrowings under the exchange cover scheme were
36 mln dlrs last month, after 163 mln in January, while
repayments were 16 mln dlrs after the previous 151 mln, a
Treasury spokesman said.
    Capital repayments totalled two mln dlrs. In January,
capital repayments totalled 14 mln dlrs, with a valuation
change that resulted in a fall of 41 mln dlrs due to the
quarterly rollover from the European Monetary Cooperation Fund
swap.
    The Treasury would not comment on the Bank of England's
market operations, but currency traders reported moderate Bank
of England intervention to curb upward pressure on the pound
today.
    A Treasury spokesman, commenting on the reserves figures,
said that the government does not want sterling either to rise
too far or to fall substantially from current levels.
    He noted that the Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson
stressed this after the recent Paris currencies meeting.

Japan's unemployment rate is expected to
continue to climb to about 3.5 pct within the next year from
January's three pct record, senior economists, including Susumu
Taketomi of Industrial Bank of Japan, said.
    December's 2.9 pct was the previous worst level since the
government's Management and Coordination Agency began compiling
statistics under its current system in 1953.
    "There is a general fear that we will become a country with
high unemployment," said Takashi Kiuchi, senior economist for
the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd.
    The government, which published the January unemployment
figures today, did not make any predictions.
    "At present we do not have a forecast for the unemployment
rate this year, but it is difficult to foresee the situation
improving," a Labour Ministry official said.
    Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the government had
expected the increase and had set aside money to help 300,000
people find jobs in fiscal 1987 beginning in April.
    Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone told a press conference
the record rate underlines the need to pass the 1987 budget
which has been held up by opposition to proposed tax reforms.
    The yen's surge has caused layoffs in the mainstay steel
and shipbuilding industries. Other export-dependent industries,
such as cars and textiles, have laid off part-time employees
and ceased hiring, economists said.
    Although the growing service industry sector has absorbed a
great number of workers the trend is starting to slow down,
said Koichi Tsukihara, Deputy General Manager of Sumitomo Bank
Ltd's economics department.
    However, other economists disagreed, saying the service
sector would be able to hire workers no longer needed by the
manufacturing sector over the next five years.

Daimler-Benz AG [DAIG.F] said its car
production could fall by 150 cars a day in  the foreseeable
future  if works councils continue to refuse to approve the
firm's requests for employees to work overtime when necessary.
    A company spokesman said the works council at Daimler's
Unterturkheim plant, which makes axles and other components for
Daimler cars, has withheld approval for overtime since the
beginning of the month. The IG Metall metalworkers union in the
state of Baden-Wuerttemberg has called on works councils in the
state to reject overtime in a bid to get industry to employ
more workers.
    The Daimler spokesman said the lack of overtime work at the
Unterturkheim plant could eventually affect car output at other
plants but added he was unable to say when this might occur.
    A spokesman for Dr.-Ing. H.C. F. Porsche AG [PSHG.F], which

Porsche would suffer any loss of production because of a ban on
overtime by its own works councils.

down the German car industry for about seven weeks as the union
sought to win a 35-hour working week for its members. It later
settled for a reduction in the working week to 38.5 hours.

Last week's White House shake-up has
increased the odds that Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul
Volcker, a symbol of strength in a government reeling from the
arms-to-Iran scandal, will serve a third term, sources close to
the Fed say.
    But they said that no decision on the appointment, which
must be filled this August, has been taken by the White House
and Volcker too has not made up his mind.
    Former White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan, who
resigned last week when ex-senator Howard Baker was named as
his replacement, was implacably opposed to Volcker and tried
often to undermine him.
    It is an open secret in Washington that Regan tried to
ensure that Volcker, first appointed in 1979 by President
Carter, will not be offered a third term by President Reagan.
    Only Volcker's key allies in the Reagan administration,
Vice-President George Bush and Treasury Secretary James Baker,
kept Regan's recent maneuvering at bay, the sources said.
    Sources close to the administration say Regan leaked a
story, quickly shot down by others in the administration, that
Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of the council of economic advisers,
had been chosen to replace Volcker.
    But as the administration's credibility was increasingly
under fire, it became clear that Regan's power to bring about
such changes was on the wane.
    The sources said New White House Chief of Staff Howard
Baker has a very good relationship with his namesake at the
Treasury Department and is likely to respect his views on the
Fed chairmanship.
    As a moderate Republican, Baker is also unlikely to share
the right-wing's opposition to Volcker.
    "This new White House is going to need all the strength it
can get," said one source when asked about the possibility of
Volcker's reappointment.
    Paul Volcker is deeply respected in financial markets both
in the United States and around the world. At a time when the
stability of the dollar and the viability of major debtor
nations are in question, Volcker's departure would definitely
undermine U.S. leadership, foreign exchange analysts say.
    U.S. officials say Volcker works very closely with Treasury
Secretary Baker on issues like international debt and global
economic cooperation.
    The two men seem only to differ on how far to deregulate
the banking industry, but recent statements by Volcker, in
which he adopted a more liberal attitude on deregulation,
signalled the politically-independent central bank is coming
around at least partially to the Treasury position.
    And a recent statement by a Reagan administration official
that the two men saw "exactly eye-to-eye" on the dollar was seen
as an indication of Baker's support for the Fed chairman.
    Baker is understood to have played a key role in Volcker's
reappointment to the Fed in mid-1983.
    The sources said Baker respects Volcker and when appointed
Treasury Secretary in February 1985, he decided to ensure a
good working relationship, in part because he believed the two
key government economic institutions have to work closely.
    Regan, Treasury Secretary during President Reagan's first
term, was formerly head of Wall Street's largest brokerage firm
Merrill Lynch and came to Washington determined to be America's
pre-eminent economic spokesman.
    He developed a deep antipathy for Volcker, whose political
skills undermined that ambition, and who financial markets took
much more seriously.
    But the sources said Volcker would have to be invited to
stay. "Is the president going to ask him? he wouldn't stay
otherwise," said one. "He'd have to be asked," said Stephen
Axilrod, formerly staff director of monetary policy at the Fed
and now vice-chairman of Nikko Securities Co. International.
    Otherwise, the list of potential candidates is not
awe-inspiring. And if Volcker left this Augsut, he would leave
behind one of the most inexperienced Fed Boards in years.
    Many analysts believe this lack of collective experience --
the four sitting members were all appointed within the last
three years -- is dangerous, coming at a time when the global
economy is threatened by instability.
    An experienced successor, therefore, would seem a
necessity. One widely mentioned possibility is Secretary of
State George Shultz, whose experience as Treasury Secretary
under Preesident Nixon and background as a trained economist
would make him ideal.
    But Shultz too may have been damaged by the arms-to-Iran
scandal, while vice-chairman Manuel Johnson is regarded at 37
years old as too young for the job.
    Other potential candidates include economist Alan
Greenspan, frequently an informal presidential economic
adviser, New York Fed President E. Gerald Corrigan, Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp chairman William Seidman, and Sprinkel.
    Long a Regan protege, Sprinkel's chances may be damaged by
his patron's departure from the White House.

General Motors Corp has changed its
method of disbursing merit raises for salaried employees and is

    He said GM will no longer include merit raises in the
calculation of base pay but will make them simply lump-sum
payments.  As a result, the merit raises will not be included
in the calculation of pensions and other benefits.  The change

    GM last year eliminated cost of living increases for
salaried workers, making pay increases based on merit alone. As
a result of the new action, GM has effectively frozen the base
pay rates of salaried employees.
    The spokesman said GM is making the change to remain

the more conventional practice of depreciating assets
individually rather than depreciating fixed assets at average
rates. The new method is expected to lead to a reduction in the
accumulated provision for depreciation and thereby increase the
net book value of tangible asssets by about 300 mln stg as at

The U.S. index of leading indicators
fell a seasonally adjusted 1.0 pct in January after a revised
2.3 pct December gain, the Commerce Department said.
    The department previously said the index rose 2.1 pct in
December.
    The decline in January was the biggest for any month since
July, 1984, when the index fell 1.7 pct.
    The January decrease left the index at 183.8 over its 1967
base of 100, and was led by a fall in contracts and orders for
plant and equipment.
    A total of six of 10 indicators available for January
contributed to the decline.
    Besides contracts and orders for plant and equipment, they
were building permits, manufacturers' new orders for consumer
goods, a change in sensitive materials prices, slower
deliveries from vendors and higher average weekly claims for
state unemployment insurance.
    Four of 10 indicators were positive, including stock
prices, new business formation, average work week and money
supply.
    The main factor for the December upward revision was new
business formation.
    There was no revision in the 0.9 pct increase in the
leading indicators index for November.
    The index of coincident indicators, which measures the
current economy, fell 0.1 pct in January after increases of 0.7

AMR Corp's American Airlines said it
will buy 40 long-range jet aircraft to support international
expansion, including routes in the Caribbean.
    Under one agreement, the airline said, it will acquire 15
Boeing Co <BA> 767-300 planes. Under a separate agreement,
American will acquire A-300-600 aircraft from <Airbus
Industrie>, a European consortium.
    The company's announcement included no value for the order.
    Published reports put the value of the aircraft order,
including engines, at 2.5 billion dlrs.
    A total of 98 General Electric Co <GE> CF6-80C2 engines is
involved in the orders, American Airlines said.
    The published reports valued the engines at five mln dlrs
each.
    The company said it will acquire the planes and engines
using rental leases that can be terminated on relatively short
notice.
    The arrangement allows the airline to acquire the planes
without adding to its debt, it explained.
    The Boeing 767s, to be delivered from February 1988 to
October 1988, will be used on routes between the U.S. and
Europe, American said.
    It said the Airbus A300s, scheduled for delivery from April
1988 through June 1989, will be assigned to the Caribbean,
where American has developed a major new hub at San Juan,
Puerto Rico.

Equatorial Communications
Co said it expects to report losses of about 57 mln dlrs for
the fourth quarter and 68 mln dlrs for the full year 1986 on
revenues of about 10 mln dlrs for the quarter and 52 mln dlrs
for the year.
    Equatorial said the losses will include a charge of about
45 mln dlrs from costs associated with the restructuring of its
business, including adjustments to reflect the market value of
transponders owned and leased by Equatorial and other reserves
for inventory, receivables and excess facilities.
    Equatorial said the fourth quarter operating results will
also include restructuring costs of about 5,500,000 dlrs, in
addition to the 45 mln dlr charge.
    Equitorial also said that as of March One it is operating
in technical default under its lease of transponders on the
Galaxy III satellite due to its inabiliuty to maintain
agreed-upon financial ratios.  It said it is in talks with the
lessors in an attempt to restructure lease obligations.
    Further, Equitorial said it is in default of two other
oblitations in connection with the purchase or lease of
transponders as a result of cross-default provisions.
    Equatorial said it has signed a memorandum of understanding
for Contel Corp <CTC> to purchase 10 mln dlrs of Equatorial
master earth stations, micro earth stations and associated
equipment and loan Equatorial six mln dlrs over a six-month
period for repayment starting in December 1988.
    The company said Conteol, under the agreement, would assume
a portion of Equatorial's rights and obligations under the
Galaxy III transponder lease with <Burnham Leasing> on the
occurrence of certain events.
    Equatorial said it would grant Contel an option to buy
about 3,600,000 common shares at 3.25 dlrs each.
    Equatorial said its understandings with Contel are subject
to Equatorial's ability to restructure a significant portion of
its obligations and to obtain concessions from lenders and
lessors, in particular under its Galaxy III transponder lease.
It said it hopes to finalize a Contel agreement by April 15.
    Equatorial in 1985 earned 1,807,000 dlrs after a 3,197,000
dlr gain from early debt retirement on revenues of 56.1 mln
dlrs. For the first nine months of 1986, the company lost
9,476,000 dlrs on revenues of 45.4 mln dlrs, compared with a
1,784,000 dlr profit after the early retirement gain on
revenues of 38.5 mln dlrs.

said in a letter it cut the amount available for raises to 3.5

lump-sum payment from April rather than being folded into
salaries and thus increasing the base for benefit payments.

<BP Oil Ltd>, the U.K. Marketing and
refining arm of British Petroleum Co Plc <BP.L>, raised its
pretax operating profit on a replacement cost basis to 182 mln
stg in calendar 1986, compared with 66 mln stg in 1985.
    Sales and operating revenue fell to 3.1 billion stg from
4.2 billion on a replacement cost basis. Historical cost
operating profit was 61 mln stg, up from 16 mln.
    BP Oil said 1985 profits had been depressed by exceptional
items. Its profit figures were stated before interest charges.

mirrored benefits of a restructuring program undertaken in
recent years.
    However, he warned future financial pressure on the
industry will be severe.
    "The U.K. Oil marketing and refining industry will need to
invest larger sums - probably around 500 mln stg a year - for a
good many years," he said in a statement.
