The U.S. Economy continued to expand in
February but at a slower pace than in January, which saw a
spurt of activity, the National Association of Purchasing
Management (NAPM) said in a report.
    The Association's composite survey index dropped to 51.9
pct in February from 55.8 pct in January, the NAPM said. It was
the seventh consecutive month in which this leading indicator
was over 50 pct.
    A reading above 50 pct generally indicates that the economy
is in an expanding phase. One below 50 pct implies a declining
economy.
    The  NAPM report, based on a survey of purchasing managers
at 250 U.S. Industrial companies, also found that the growth
rate in new orders and production slowed in February.
    But production remained vigorous, with more than three
times as many members reporting it better rather than worse.
    Vendor deliveries improved slightly last month, but members
reported that steel supplies were tight as USX Corp gradually
resumed production.
    The same number of members reported inventories were higher
as reported them lower. The NAPM said that had not happened
since August 1984.
    For a sixth straight month, more purchasers reported paying
higher rather than lower prices, this time by a ratio of nine
to one.
    Robert Bretz, chairman of the NAPM's business survey
committee, said: "The economy continued to expand in February,
but at a more subdued rate than in January. The slowing of new
orders should not be significant enough to dampen prospects for
a respectable first quarter."
    The composite index is a seasonally adjusted figure, based
on five components of the NAPM business survey - new orders,
production, vendor deliveries, inventories and employment.

Union Carbide Corp is looking to

Chemicals and Plastics.
    Describing this as a major departure in the company's
approach to commercial development, he told the annual new
business forum of the Commercial Development Association "We
are looking to acquisitions and joint ventures when they look
like the fastest and most promising routes to the growth
markets we've identified."
    Not very long ago Union Carbide had the attitude "that if
we couldn't do it ourselves, it wasn't worth doing. Or, if it
was worth doing, we had to go it alone," Lichtenberger
explained.
    He said "there are times when exploiting a profitable
market is done best with a partner. Nor do we see any need to
plow resources into a technology we may not have if we can link
up profitably with someone who is already there."
    He said Carbide has extended its catalyst business that way
and is now extending its specialty chemicals business in the
same way.

The New York Mercantile Exchange set
April one for the debut of a new procedure in the energy
complex that will increase the use of energy futures worldwide.
     On April one, NYMEX will allow oil traders that do not
hold a futures position to initiate, after the exchange closes,
a transaction that can subsequently be hedged in the futures
market, according to an exchange spokeswoman.
    "This will change the way oil is transacted in the real
world," said said Thomas McKiernan, McKiernan and Co chairman.
    Foreign traders will be able to hedge trades against NYMEX
prices before the exchange opens and negotiate prices at a
differential to NYMEX prices, McKiernan explained.
     The expanded program "will serve the industry because the
oil market does not close when NYMEX does," said Frank Capozza,
secretary of Century Resources Inc.
     The rule change, which has already taken effect for
platinum futures on NYMEX, is expected to increase the open
interest and liquidity in U.S. energy futures, according to
traders and analysts.
    Currently, at least one trader in this transaction, called
an exchange for physical or EFP, must hold a futures position
before entering into the transaction.
    Under the new arrangement, neither party has to hold a
futures position before entering into an EFP and one or both
parties can offset their cash transaction with a futures
contract the next day, according to exchange officials.
    When NYMEX announced its proposed rule change in December,
NYMEX President Rosemary McFadden, said, "Expansion of the EFP
provision will add to globalization of the energy markets by
providing for, in effect, 24-hour trading."
    The Commodity Futures Trading Commission approved the rule
change in February, according to a CFTC spokeswoman.

The U.S. index of leading indicators
fell a seasonally adjusted 1.0 pct in January after a revised
2.3 pct December gain, the Commerce Department said.
    The department previously said the index rose 2.1 pct in
December.
    The decline in January was the biggest for any month since
July, 1984, when the index fell 1.7 pct.
    The January decrease left the index at 183.8 over its 1967
base of 100, and was led by a fall in contracts and orders for
plant and equipment.
    A total of six of 10 indicators available for January
contributed to the decline.
    Besides contracts and orders for plant and equipment, they
were building permits, manufacturers' new orders for consumer
goods, a change in sensitive materials prices, slower
deliveries from vendors and higher average weekly claims for
state unemployment insurance.
    Four of 10 indicators were positive, including stock
prices, new business formation, average work week and money
supply.
    The main factor for the December upward revision was new
business formation.
    There was no revision in the 0.9 pct increase in the
leading indicators index for November.
    The index of coincident indicators, which measures the
current economy, fell 0.1 pct in January after increases of 0.7
pct in December and 0.2 pct in November.
    The index of lagging indicators, which measures past
economic activity, rose 0.5 pct in January after a decrease of
0.5 pct in December and an increase of 0.2 pct in November.
