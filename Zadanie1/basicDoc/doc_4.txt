Northeast Savings F.A. said its
board adopted a shareholder rights plan designed to protect the
company from coercive takeover tactics and bids not fair to all
sharholders.
    Under the plan, the board declared a dividend of one share
purchase right for each of the Northeast common shares held of
record as of November two, the company said.
    Initially, the rights are not exerciseable, rights
certificates are not distributed, and the rights automatically
trade with Northeast's shares, the company said.
    However, 20 days following the acquisition of 20 pct or
more of Northeast's common shares shares or 20 days following
the commencement of a tender offer for 30 pct or more of
Northeast's shares, the rights will become exerciseable and
separate rights certificates will be distributed, the company
said.
    The rights will entitle holders of Northeast's common
shares to purchase additional shares at an exercise price of 60
dlrs a share, the company said.
    The company said that in the event of certain triggering
events described in the rights plan, holders of the rights,
other than an acquiring person, will be entitled to acquire
Northeast's common shares having a market value of twice the
then-current exercise price of the rights. Also, in the event
Northeast enters into certain business combination
transactions, holders of the rights will be provided a right to
acquire equity securities of the acquiring entity having a
market value of twice the then-current exercise price of the
rights, the company said. Northeast said it will be entitled to
redeem the rights at one cent per right until the occurence of
certain events.

Caterpillar Inc said it expects 1987
full year sales and profits to be "substantially better" than
1986 results, following improved third-quarter performance.
    Third-quarter earnings of the heavy machinery manufacturer
increased to 146 mln dlrs, or 1.47 dlrs a share, from net loss
of 26 mln dlrs, or 26 cts, in the 1986 quarter. Sales rose to
2.25 billion dlrs from 1.82 billion dlrs last year.
    A weaker U.S. dollar strengthened Caterpillar's position
against foreign manufacturers and permitted price increases and
boosted sales, while a cost-cutting program lowered costs
significantly, the company said of third-quarter results.
   
    Continuation of the cost-reduction program, which is to
pare costs by 15 to 20 pct from 1986 to 1990, and a further
anticipated improvement in its price competitiveness are
expected to contribute to higher full year 1987 profits,
Caterpillar said.
    In 1986, the company earned 76 mln dlrs or 77 cents a
share.

LSI Logic Corp said it has
developed a semi-custom microchip that is twice as dense as the
most complex chip now available.
    The new microchip, LCA 100K Compacted Array Plus, has
100,000 usable gate arrays, or the equivalent of 400,000
transistors for designing custom chips, the company said.
    Production of the new chip will begin in about 15 months,
said LSI Chairman Wilfred Corrigan.
    The microchip can be used in products including computers,
telecommunications and military equipment, allowing them to
operate faster with improved reliability, the company said.
    "This technology will pave the way for new uses in
artificial intelligence, speech recognition and speech
synthesis, as well as digital signal processing and image
processing," Corrigan said. He also predicted the microchip
will add about five pct to the company's revenues next year.
    Analyst Millard Phelps of Hambrecht and Quist Inc said he
expects LSI to finish its 1987 fiscal year with per share
earnings of 24 cts, on sales of 252 mln dlrs. He put 1988
earnings at 60 cts per share on 330 mln dlrs in sales.
   In the nine months ended Sept 27, LSI had earnings of 14 cts
per share, or 5,560,000 dlrs, on 183.9 mln dlrs in sales.

Federal Reserve Board Vice-Chairman
Manuel Johnson cautioned against seeking "quick-fix solutions" to
persistent U.S. trade and federal budget deficits.
    In particular, he told an American Stock Exchange
conference, a decline in the dollar below current levels would
exacerbate financial market conditions.
    "Trying to artificially depress the dollar severely below
current levels ... would exacerbate financial market conditions
and lead to further potential for financial problems."
    Nowhere, Johnson said, are Fed officials hearing that U.S.
businesses cannot compete at current exchange rates.
    He acknowledged the U.S. trade deficit was persisting
despite a decline in the dollar's value of 40 to 50 pct in the
past two years.
    But the deficit is improving in volume terms and will soon
begin showing improvement.
    "The stage I think is being set for a healthy, constructive
expansion without inflationary instability," he said.

Federal Deposit Insurance Corp chairman
William Seidman said he is worried that consumer confidence
will be undermined by panic selling of stocks.
    "The principal worry is that the market will panic and
destroy the really strong confidence that the consumer has in
the economy," Seidman told reporters during the American
Bankers Association annual convention.
    But Seidman was relaxed about the implications for banks.
"I don't see any near-term effect on the banking system. We
would have to worry if it throws the economy into a major
recession. We don't expect that to happen." he said.
    First Chicago Corp chairman Barry Sullivan echoed Seidman,
saying that the slump in stocks could hasten a recession "if it
significantly impacts consumer confidence."
    But Sullivan told reporters that he thinks the U.S. economy
remains sound.
    Sullivan said the slide in stocks was an extreme reaction
to recent increases in interest rates.
    Asked whether First Chicago would follow Chemical Bank in
raising its prime rate to 9-3/4 pct from 9-1/4, Sullivan said,
"We're looking very carefully at the money markets."
    The FDIC's Seidman, asked whether the stock market rout was
a reason to reconsider plans to give broader securities powers
to commercial s, said, "Under the plan we are suggesting
that (securities) activities be done in subsidiaries so if ever
things go badly for them it won't affect their capital."

has raised 61 mln European Currency Units (ECUs) which will be
invested in management buy-outs and development capital
opportunities in the U.K. And continental Europe.
    The funds were raised through BCI's first such fund - the

European countries. It expects to raise another 40 mln ECUs
soon through a French fund and a fund for U.S. Investors.
    BCI was set up last year by Baring Brothers to advise

    BCI said the new fund is structured as a Guernsey-based
unit trust, which will be listed on the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange. It will be advised by BCI and managed by a company
owned jointly by Barings and the management of BCI.
    Individual investments are expected to range between one

Germany and France.
    BCI said its aims are to invest in established companies,
principally family companies with succession-issues and
corporate spin-offs.

International monetary officials will 
rush to paper over the deep cracks that have appeared in the
Louvre accord on currency stability to prevent a dollar
free-fall and to calm turmoil in world capital markets,
economists and currency traders said.
    "I don't think the Louvre is dead because if it breaks up
in an acrimonious way, the potential outcome is a rout of the
dollar, higher interest rates and collapsing stock markets.
It's in the Group of Seven's interest to calm things down,"
said Douglas Madison, corporate trader at BankAmerica Corp.
   
    In a weekend television interview, U.S. Treasury secretary
James Baker sharply criticised a recent rise in West German
money market rates and said the eight month-old Louvre pact to
foster exchange rate stability needs to be reviewed.
    His comments rocked the currency markets and helped send
the already-fragile U.S. and overseas stock markets into a
tailspin.
    The dollar lost more than two pfennigs in the U.S. to about
1.7740/50 marks and about one yen to 141.25/35 yen. The Dow
Jones Industrial Average slumped more than 200 points at one

Crazy Eddie Inc said its board will
not oppose the slate of nominees proposed for election to the
board by the committee led by Entertainment Marketing Inc <EM>
and the <Oppenheimer-Palmieri Fund, LP.>
    Crazy Eddie said its board is not endorsing, but will
simply refrain from opposing, the EMI-Palmieri nominees.    
The board also said it will ask representatives of the
Committee to Restore Shareholder value to begin acquainting
themselves with the business and affairs of the company as
promptly as possible.
   
    To that end, the committee's representatives will be
invited in advance of the annual meeting to examine the
company's financial records, to monitor its operations and to
join company officers in meetings with the company's suppliers,
bankers and key personnel, Crazy Eddie said.
    The board said that to continue to oppose the EMI-Palmieri
group would only increase the expenses of the company, create
further uncertainty among its suppliers, customers and
employees, and result in deterioration of moral among company
personnel.
    A further release from the company will follow, it said.

differentials to no more than one pct per year from the
national average loan rate, starting with 1988 crops.

increase the unpaid acreage reduction requirement for corn by
"an appropriate amount to generate savings" if projected corn

Monsanto Co said sales of its
Nutrasweet artificial sweetener fell slightly in the third
quarter due to a continuing decline in usage by the powdered
soft drink market.
    "It doesn't look as if there is going to be any improvement
in the powdered soft drink sector," said Donna Smith, a
Monsanto spokeswoman.
    The company reported third quarter sales of 1.90 billion
dlrs from 1.69 billion a year earlier. Nutrasweet sales fell to
177 mln from 179 mln a year earlier, it said.
    A growing market for diet sodas, about 90 pct of which use
Nutrasweet, offset much of the sales loss, said Monsanto chief
economist Nick Filippello.
    Prospects remain strong in the diet soda market, Filippello
said, since industry analysts predict diet carbonated soft
drinks will hold about 28 pct of the soda market by year's end,
up from 25 pct in 1986.
    That market, coupled with increased usage of Nutrasweet in
such items as frozen desserts, should result in a 10 pct
increase in consumer consumption of the sweetener in 1987,
Filippello said.
    Monsanto spokeswoman Donna Smith refused to comment on the
company's pricing policies for Nutrasweet.
    However, Filippello said it was fair to assume that
Monsanto priced Nutrasweet at a lower rate for the diet soda
market.
    Nutrasweet sales have been falling since the fourth quarter
of 1986 when medical studies raised questions about its
possible side effects, such as migraine headaches.
    Monsanto acquired G.D. Searle and Co, Nutrasweet's maker in
1986.

Wang Laboratories Inc announced four
additions to its VS line of minicomputers which it said will
offer double the capacity of the older models they replace.
    Company officials told a news conference that Wang will
also announce new entry level and high end computers within the
next 12 months and a family of powerful work stations by the
end of this year.
    Ian Diery, Wang's senior vice president of U.S. operations,
said the new models are lower priced than comparable computers
from Digital Equipment Corp <DEC>, the world's largest maker of
minicomputers.
   
    Minicomputers are medium sized machines usually used within
a department or work group of a larger company and typically
cost between 10,000 and 500,000 dlrs.
    The VS 5E will replace Wang's entry level VS 5. Priced at
13,000 dlrs, it can support up to 16 users, double the eight
supported by the five and has three times the disc capacity of
the older system.
    The VS 6E can support up to 32 users, double the capacity
of the model six it replaces, and has three times the storage
capacity of the older model. The 6E is priced at 22,000 dlrs.
   
    The VS 75E, which replaces the 65, can support 64 users, 60
pct more than the older model and has twice the main memory
capacity. It is priced at 44,000 dlrs.
    The new VS 7010, which acts as an entry level system for
Wang's more powerful 7000 family of minicomputers, can support
between 30 and 55 users. It is priced at 75,000 dlrs.
    All the new systems are now available, Diery said.
    Bob Ano, Wang's senior vice president of corporate
marketing, said that before the end of the company's fiscal
year on June 30 it will introduce an entry level computer that
will have four times the power of the 5E introduced today.
   
    Within the next 12 to 18 months, he said, Wang will
announce a more powerful high-end machine that will offer
double the price/performance of its 7000 series.
    Ano said the new family of work stations planned for this

    Ruder, who spoke to reporters after addressing an American

the SEC does not have the legal authority to order a trading

International Minerals Ltd <GIM.V> at 50 cts per share to raise
200,000 dlrs Canadian.
    The company said one of the conditions of the placement was

Igene Biotechnology Inc said it
terminated its license agreement with Hercules Inc <HPC> for
the manufacture of Igene's natural food preservative and mold
inhibitor.
    It said the cancellation agreed to by both companies.
    Igene said its Weyco-Serv product was licensed to Hercules

    Under the terms of the agreement, Igene regains all rights,
title and interest in its proprietary microorganisms, process
and product and will repay out of future products sales certain
royalties.
   
    The cancellation of the contract allows Igene to proceed
with plans to produce NaturServ, a modified version of
Weyco-Serv, the company said. The new product is expected to be
available early next year, Igene said.
    The company also said it plans to build a new multiproduct
fermentation plant to meet anticipated demand for NaturServ and
other company natural products.
    Both Weyco-Serv and NaturServ contain high concentrations
of acid salts that naturally inhibit spoilage and molding, the

International Multifoods Corp
said it filed a suit charging Bregman Partners and its
affiliates unlawfully planned to acquire control of the
company.
    In a suit filed in U.S. District Court, International
Multifoods said Bregman Partners and its affiliates, who
reportedly hold 7.4 pct of the company's shares, tried to
induce Multifood's management to join them in an effort to take
the company private and give controlling interest to Bregman
Partners. Bregman Partners include the interests of the
Belzberg families of Canada.
    The complaint also discloses that on each occasion,
Multifoods management rejected the group's overtures.
    Multifoods is asking Bregman's group to divest its shares
in open market sales in a manner not to further disrupt the
market place, according to the suit. The suit seeks
compensatory and punitive damages in an amount to be
determined.
    In addition, Multifoods is seeking to stop Bregman Partners
from acquiring any more stock, or voting the shares it
reportedly owns, the suit said.
    According to Multifoods, the actions proposed by Bregman
Partners would prevent shareholders from realizing the full
benefits of the company's restructuring.
    In the past three years, Multifoods has substantially
altered its domestic business mix by divesting its U.S.
consumere foods operations and emphasizing growth in selected
segments of the U.S. foodservice industry.

<Salomon Brothers Inc> is not withdrawing
as a market maker in euroyen bonds, contrary to strong market
rumours circulating in London, a London-based spokeswoman for
the company's New York headquarters said.
    Earlier, a spokesman for Salomon Brothers' London
operations declined to comment at all on rumours that have been
circulating here.
    Euroyen bond traders had said they were informally
contacted by their counterparts at Salomon and told that they
would no longer be market makers in those securities.
    The traders said that Salomon had not notified the
Association of International Bond Dealers (AIBD) of its plans
to withdraw as a market maker. Under new rules recently adopted
by the AIBD, notification would be required if the firm decided
it no longer wished to make two-way prices at all times in
euroyen bonds.
    According to dealers at several Japanese banks, Salomon's
euroyen bond traders have been in a meeting and unavailable to
make prices. Market sources said that Salomon had offered the
traders a chance to remain with the firm if they were willing
to trade eurobonds denominated in other currencies.
    Dealers noted that at one point this year, euroyen bond
issuance had actually outpaced that of eurodollar denominated
bonds, the first time the U.S. Unit has been eclipsed as the
currency of choice for international borrowers.
    Dealers said that given the dollar's recent weakness, the
yen could once again top the eurobond issuance tables.
    Last week, Salomon Brothers announced it would trim its
worldwide staff by 800 and withdraw from several areas of
business, most specifically short term bank lending.

Financial Corp of America, in

and mortgage-backed securities, which has been the company's
main source of profit during the past two years, fell to 12.4
mln dlrs as compared to a 93.4 mln in the third quarter last
year.
    It said the income was reduced by adverse interest rate
fluctuations during the quarter.
    The company also said it made an additional provision of
70.4 mln dlrs to its reserve for losses on loans and real
estate, compared with 76.2 mln dlrs a year ago.
    Financial Corp said its reserve totaled 1.00 billion dlrs
at September 30, 1987, compared with a total of 580.4 mln at
the same time a year ago.
    Financial Corp, the nation's largest thrift, reported a
third quarter loss of 75.8 mln dlrs, or 2.20 dlrs per share,
compared with an 11.6 mln dlr profit last year.
    At the end of the quarter scheduled items, or non- or
under-performing assets, were 1.34 billion dlrs, or 4.01 pct of
total regulatory assets, down from 1.77 billion, or 5.20 pct of
assets at the end of the 1986 third quarter, the company said.
    In reporting third quarter results the company also said
its highest priority is to raise capital and strengthen its
financial base.
    "We are responsible to our shareholders and therefore are
exploring several alternatives for achieving value while
raising capital.
    "Any proposal to acquire or restructure the company will be
viewed by management from this perspective," Financial Corp
chairman William Popejoy said in a statement.

An Iowa State University study showed
pork contains considerably less fat than indicated by
long-established U.S. Department of Agriculture statistics, the
National Pork Producers Council (NPPC) said.
    Six of the seven muscle cuts evaluated in the study
averaged 4.3 pct fat or less, well below American Heart
Association guidelines for recommended foods. Eighty pct of all
the raw boneless rib chops evaluated in the study contained
less than six pct fat, the NPPC said.
    Meanwhile, USDA Handbook 8-10 - long used as the
established authority on nutrient composition, indicates a fat
content for center loin pork of 7.3 pct, the NPPC said.
    Robin Kline, a dietitian and Director of Consumer Affairs
for the NPPC said he was not surprised at the wide discrepancy
between the study and the USDA handbook.
    "Handbook 8-10 is based to a certain extent on information
that has been accumulated over the past 30 years. The
statistics in it about pork do not reflect the hog of today
which is about 50 pct leaner than it was 20 or 30 years ago,
thanks to genetic improvements and better feeding practices,"
Kline said.
    The study, funded by NPPC with producer checkoff money,
evaluated pork carcasses from 47 Iowa producers in categories
from 0.7 to 1.3 inches of backfat. Researchers measured the fat
content of the seven muscles before cooking, and the fat,
moisture and tenderness of cooked boneless rib chops.

CalFed Inc said strong loan volume
and higher net increase income at its principal subsidiary,
the California Federal Savings and Loan Association,
contributed to the best third-quarter and nine-month results in
the company's history.
    On a per-share basis, CalFed's fully diluted earnings were
1.80 dlrs for the third quarter of 1987 and 4.87 dlrs for the
nine months ended Sept 30, 1987, compared with 1.75 dlrs and
4.76 dlrs in the comparable 1986 period.
    CalFed is a 23.1 bln dlr diversified financial-services
company.
    "Key factors leading to the company's higher earnings were
continued strong loan volume, an increase in net interest
income and higher earnings from non-real estate sources," said
George Rutland, president and chief executive officer of the
firm of CalFed Inc.
    Net earnings in the third quarter of 1987 were 50 mln dlrs,
a 3.1 pct gain over 48.5 mln in the same period last year. They
increased 3.9 pct in the first nine months of this year
compared with last year, totalling 134.6 mln dlrs against 129.6
mln.
    California Federal Savings and Loan Association contributed
net earnings of 44.5 mln dlrs for the third quarter of 1987
compared with 43.4 mln for the third quarter of 1986. For the
nine-month period ended Sept 30, it had net earnings of 116.3
mln dlrs against 114.9 mln in the comparable 1986 period.
    California Federal's net interest income for the third
quarter of 1987 rose 18.1 pct to 131.6 mln dlrs, up from 111.4
mln for the third quarter of 1986. For the first nine months of
1987, it totalled 383 mln dlrs, a 13.9 pct increase over 336.2
mln in the comparable 1986 period.
    CalFed Inc said that the increase in its subsidiary's net
interest income was a result of higher average balances of
interest-earning assets for the savings and loan operations.
    CalFed said the savings and loan unit's loan originations
were unchanged in the third quarter of 1987 compared with last
year at 1.8 billion dlrs. But for the first nine months of
1987, they rose to 5.4 billion dlrs from 4.9 billion in 1996.
    California Federal's provision for loan losses rose to 19.4
mln dlrs in the 1987 third quarter compared with 15.5 mln last
year and to 63.3 mln for first the nine months of 1987 compared
with 30.6 mln.

Security Pacific Corp <SPC> said
growth in its third-quarter earnings was slowed by the purchase
of Rainier Bancorp and the suspension of interest payments on
Brazilian and Ecuadorian loans that were placed on a
non-accrual status earlier this year.
    The bank said it earned 128.1 mln dlrs in the third
quarter, up from 118.3 mln a year earlier. On a per-share
basis, income was 1.16 dlrs a share, up from 1.09 dlrs.
    The bank said non-recurring costs of 10.1 mln dlrs
associated with the acquisition of Rainier, a 9.5-billion-dlr
Seattle-based concern, cut earnings per share by nine cents.
    Security Pacific also said the suspension of interest
payments on the Brazilian and Ecuadorian debt reduced net
income by 8.1 mln dlrs, or seven cents a share.
    Security Pacific completed its acquisition of Rainier on
August 31. Security Pacific's results have been restated to
reflect the "pooling-of-interests" acquisition.
    "Our third-quarter performance was strong, clearly
demonstrating the stability and balance in our earnings
streams," said Richard Flamson, chairman and chief executive
officer. "The addition of Rainier," he continued, "adds very
significantly to the strength of our western banking network."
    The inclusion of Orbanco and Arizona Bancwest earnings
affected comparison of most financial categories.
    Fully-taxable equivalent net interest income was 602.4 mln
dlrs, up from 538.6 mln. The suspension of interest payments on
Brazilizan and Ecuadorian debt reduced net interest income by
41.9 mln dlrs.
    Non-interest income rose to 471.6 mln dlrs from 412.1 mln.
    Third-quarter provision for credit losses was 89.6 mln
dlrs, down 17.9 mln dlrs. As a percentage of average loans and
lease financing, net credit losses were 0.68 pct, down from
0.79 pct a year earlier.
    Non-performing loans and leases were 2.038 billion dlrs at
the end of the quarter, or 3.96 pct of loans and leases, up
from 1.377 billion a year ago.
    Other non-interest expense, composed of staff and other
expenses, was 757.6 mln dlrs, up from 616.2 mln. The rise
included an increase in staff expenses to 379.7 mln dlrs from
313.0 mln dlrs.
    Excluding Orbanco and Arizona Bancwest, average loans grew
11 pct. Real estate and international loan growth had the
greatest rises of 16 pct and 15 pct, respectively.
    Shareholders equity was 3.486 billion dlrs at the end of
the third quarter, up from 3.381 billion.
    The primary capital ratio was 7.41 pct, based on period-end
capital and quarterly average assets, up from 7.01 pct a year
earlier.

IC Industries Inc said its board approved
a second major step in the reorganization and restructuring of
the company.
    To implement the plan of sharpening its strategic focus on
consumer goods and services, the company will give serious
consideration to the sale of its Pneumo Abex, its aerospace and
defense company, if it can realize a price which will return
maximum value to shareholders.
    In 1986, Pneumo Abex had operating income of 118.1 mln dlrs
on sales of 900.5 mln dlrs.
    IC said it will use the proceeds of any asset sale to
invest in new high-return businesses in the consumer goods and
services field.
    The company said it authorized a program to repurchase
between 500 mln dlrs and 1.0 billion dlrs of IC's common stock
from time to time when conditions warrant.
    It also said it will begin an immediate cost-reduction
program to cust annual operating expenses by 50 mln dlrs.
    An IC spokesman said the cost-reduction program involved
"across-the-board" cuts rather than specific about targeted
areas.
    IC's board earlier approved a plan to spin off the
company's Illinois Central Gulf Railroad to shareholders. The
company's other major subsidiaries are Pet Inc, Pepsi-Cola
General Bottlers, Midas International Corp and Hussmann Corp.

American Telephone and Telegraph Co said
it plans to build a new computer that incorrates a unified
version of its UNIX System IV operating system and Sun
Microsystems Inc's recently annouced SPARC micropocessor.
    The SPARC chip is based on reduced instruction-set
computing, or RISC, technology. 
    ATT said the version of UNIX used by the new computer will
incorporate po;ular features of the Berkeley 4.2 system, a
dirative of the UNIX system used widely in scientific and
engineering markets, as well as features of SunOs, a variant of
the Berkely system sold by Sun.
    ATT said it would take 18 months to two years to develop
new computers based on the Sun microchip and the merged version
of the UNIX operating system.
    Vittorio Cassoni, president of ATT's newly-formed Data
Systems Group, said the company will not offer the new machines
until the merged version of UNIX is completed.
    "It's the software that will determine the availability of
products based on SPARC," he said.
    Eventually ATT's entire line of 3B mini computers will be
converted to the SPARC architecture, Cassoni said.
   
    The investment of all current users will be protected,
meaning that they will be able to maintain the software used on
the current 3B line, he said.
    Cassoni also said ATT's sales of computers declined in the
first nine months of the year compared with the first nine
months of last year.
    The lower sales were primarily the result of ATT's
transition to a new line of computers, he said.
    However, "demand for the new products is way, way above
expectation," he stated.

it posted a 1987 first-half group loss of about 14 mln marks,
of which the largest portion was in the U.S.
    Managing board chairman Armin Dassler told the annual
shareholders' meeting parent company turnover was expected to
fall to 650 mln marks over the whole year from 698.4 mln in
1986.
    No comparative figure for 1986 first half group loss was
available. In the whole of 1986 Puma posted a group
consolidated loss of 41.05 mln marks.
    Dassler said Puma hoped to improve performance in the U.S.
This year, where heavy losses were mainly responsible for the
1986 deficit.
    He said Puma expected to post a group loss in the second
half of this year but the shortfall would be lower than in the
first half. The same applied to expected parent company losses,
he added.
    Dassler said Puma had taken measures to improve future
performance.
    Dassler said the measures included changing Puma's  
product range, closing down some unprofitable factories in West
Germany and France and introducing general cost-cutting.
    He said Puma hoped to break even in 1988 in the U.S., Its
most important export market.
    Dassler said a personal payment he would make to
shareholders instead of a 1986 dividend was a goodwill gesture
which would not be repeated.
    Dassler said the payment to holders of Puma's 280,000
non-voting preference shares would amount to about 1.2 mln
marks, or 4.50 marks per share.
    Armin Dassler and his brother Gerd hold all of Puma's
720,000 ordinary voting shares. They offered the preference
shares to the public in July last year.
    Dassler said shareholders would benefit if Puma improved
performance next year. He did not elaborate.
    Dassler said he and his brother were planning to leave the
managing board and join the supervisory board.
    He said he was leaving for health reasons and because he
wanted to make way for a new chairman from outside the company.
His successor has not been made known yet.
    Dassler said today's meeting was expected to approve
Manfred Emcke as Puma's new supervisory board chairman,
replacing Vinzenz Grothgar.

Karl Otto Poehl, head of West Germany's
central bank, and Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg are
normally so much in agreement that some foreigners doubt the
central bank's independence.
    But a rare public row between the ebullient Poehl,
president of the Bundesbank, and Stoltenberg, over a
controversial investment tax proposal, has added to the woes of
the country's already nervous financial markets, bankers said.
    Poehl told an investment symposium in Frankfurt last
Thursday he feared the tax would raise borrowing costs and
interest rates
    Stoltenberg quickly issued a statement rebutting Poehl's
criticism, saying West Germany would remain an attractive place
for foreign investors.
    "The obvious lack of coordination between the Bundesbank and
Finance Ministry does not instil confidence in foreign
investors," said one economist for a London broker, who asked
not to be identified.
    Bankers here expressed confidence the two top financial
policy-makers would quickly patch up their relationship to
steer the economy through a particularly difficult time.
    "There are plenty of objective pressures which will result
in things getting back to normal again after a period of ill
feeling," said Commerzbank AG chief economist Juergen Pfister.
    News on October 9 that the government was planning a 10 pct
withholding tax wiped billions of marks off shares and bonds in
a market already reeling from rising interest rates at home and
abroad.
    Bankers said the Bundesbank was angered by the way the
finance ministry announced the plan -- without consulting the
Bundesbank adequately, and allowing apparently conflicting
details to dribble out into an unprepared and uncertain market.
    Both Poehl, 57, and Stoltenberg, 59, have been under
extraordinary pressures lately.
    Poehl has had to switch to the hard line promoted by his
deputy, Helmut Schlesinger, jacking up interest rates to fight
inflationary fears and abandoning the pragmatic policies he had
pursued so far this year to promote currency stability.
    In recent statements Poehl has sounded more like
Schlesinger. For years the softly-spoken economist has been
warning in speech after speech that excessive money supply
growth would eventually lead to rising prices.
    Schlesinger now has a majority of support in the Bundesbank
council, and since late summer Poehl has had to represent his
views, bankers said.
    "Poehl is in a minority in his own house," said Commerzbank's
Pfister.
    "Poehl is in a dilemma. He must follow a policy that is not
entirely his own," said another economist.
    The dilemma is that if German interest rates rise too far,
they will attract funds into the country, pushing up the mark
and hurting West German exporters.
    The dollar has now shed some seven pfennigs since the
Bundesbank's new tack became clear in early October.
    Since last Thursday, United States Treasury Secretary James
Baker has criticized the Bundesbank rate increases.
    Bankers said this could foreshadow a revival of the 1986
war of words between the U.S. And West Germany, in which U.S.
Officials talked down the dollar to force West Germany to
stimulate its economy and thus suck in more U.S. Exports.
    One way West Germany agreed to do this was making a round
of tax cuts worth 39 billion marks from 1990.
    But financing these tax cuts has proved more difficult for
Stoltenberg than he had bargained for.
    The cool, unflappable northerner, who was regularly voted
most popular government politician last year, had to face
resistance from local barons in the government coalition
parties and from trade unions to his planned subsidy cuts.
    The withholding tax was intended to plug one gap by raising
4.3 billion marks.
    But it has caused an outcry among bankers, who say it will
push up borrowing costs. The extra amount this costs the
government could wipe out the revenue the tax brings in.
    Meanwhile Stoltenberg is dealing with a local political row
which has turned into the country's worst political scandal.
    Stoltenberg had to leave monetary talks in Washington last
month early to sort out a row in the northern state of
Schleswig-Holstein, where he heads the ruling CDU party.
    The state's CDU premier, Uwe Barschel, had to resign after
allegations of a "dirty tricks" election campaign led to heavy
losses for the CDU in state elections.
    Barschel was found dead in a hotel bath in Geneva last
weekend. Police say the death appears to have been suicide.
    Cooperation between Poehl and Stoltenberg is all the more
remarkable as Poehl is in the opposition Social Democrats, and
was appointed by former chancellor Helmut Schmidt.
    When Poehl's contract came up for renewal earlier this
year, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's CDU-led coalition government
gave Poehl another eight-year term.
    Werner Chrobok, managing partner at Bethmann Bank, said he
hoped the two men would soon be of one opinion again.
    But when Poehl criticized Stoltenberg's tax plans he was
not only voicing what many bankers felt but demonstrating the
Bundesbank's independence of government, Chrobok said.

No clear indication has emerged of the
victor in the race to succeed Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone
but political analysts said it was becoming more likely that
former foreign minister Shintaro Abe would be chosen.
    A decision on which of the three contenders would be picked
was expected late today or early on Tuesday, they said.
    Japanese political leaders held a flurry of closed-door
meetings today and the three candidates called on Nakasone, who
is due to step down late this month, to mediate to break the
deadlock.
    The other candidates are Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa
and former Finance Minister Noboru Takeshita.
    They are vying for the post of president of the ruling
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), who is automatically prime
minister by virtue of the party's parliamentary majority.
    The new LDP president will be named formally at a party
convention on October 30 and elected prime minister by
parliament, probably on November 6, LDP sources said.
    Nakasone, 69, is due to retire on October 31 after five
years in the post, an exceptionally long term by Japanese
standards.
    Takeshita, who is head of the party's largest faction, had
steadfastly opposed the idea of seeking Nakasone's help, but he
told reporters: "It is possible Nakasone will be given carte
blanche (for selection of his successor)."
    One political analyst, who declined to be identified, said
Nakasone, despite a personal preference for Miyazawa, is likely
to choose Abe as the best candidate for steering Japan through
its international problems and maintaining party unity. Abe
also would also accept Nakasone's influence, he said. Analysts
said one of Nakasone's prime aims is to retain as much power as
possible following his retirement.
    Takeshita, the early favorite because of the size of his
faction, is viewed by many politicians and analysts as being
unsuitable for the post of prime minister because of his lack
of international experience.
    The analysts said Nakasone also was very unlikely to
support Takeshita's bid because of the differences in their
political styles.

French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur
issued a firm call for the continued faithful application of
the Louvre accords on currency stability by all major

    But Baker said at the weekend that the West German rate
rise was "not in keeping with the spirit of what we agreed to."
    "What I'm really saying is that they should not expect us to
simply sit back here and accept increased tightening on their
part on the assumption that somehow we are going to follow

An announcement by Alliant Computer
Systems Inc <ALNT> of a new low-end near-supercomputer and <ETA
Systems Inc>'s unveiling of a high-end machine in the same
category show competition is stiff in this market, industry
analysts said.
     Consultants said Alliant's new FX computer, aimed mainly
at scientists and researchers will be priced between 100,000
and 200,000 dlrs and will be faster than anything else in that
price range. But they said Alliant is trying to bring prices in
line with discounts it now gives many of its customers.
    "(The new FX) is significant to the extent that it
represents Alliant's recognition of the reality of the
marketplace," said a source who was briefed by Alliant on the
new computer. "The list price is more in line with what they are
seeing anyway."
    Near-supercomputers, often called mini-supercomputers,
resemble the massive supercomputers favoured by scientists but
are much less expensive and a quarter as powerful.
    Supercomputers cost well over one mln dlrs but
mini-supercomputers are generally priced between 200,000 dlrs
and one mln dlrs.
    Most near-supercomputers use a new computer architecture
called parallel processing, in which a problem is broken up
into segments and each segment assigned to a different
processor. General-purpose mainframe computers have just one
processor that works on one segment of a problem at a time,
making them too slow for complex scientific problems.
    Near-supercomputers have been in existence for only about
five years and the two leading manufacturers, Alliant and
Convex Computer Corp (CNVX), held two of the most successful
initial public offerings last year.
    But Alliant and Convex, a Texas company, are also facing
some 15 companies competing for between 200 and 250 mln dlrs in
sales this year, and the result has been lower prices and
shrinking profit margins.
    Heavy discounting, slow acceptance outside the scientific
market, lack of software and too many competitors also have
made analysts reassess prospects for near-supercomputers.
    Jeffrey Canin, computer analyst with Hambrecht and Quist,
said he just added a year to his original growth estimates for
the industry. He now expects sales to reach 1.1 billion dlrs in
1991, instead of 1990.
    In recent weeks both Alliant and Convex have said their
third quarter earnings would be reduced by "competitive pricing
pressures."
    Alliant said profits for the period will be about five
cents a share against eight cents last year, although revenues
for the period rose to 14.2 mln dlrs from 8.6 mln.
    Convex said third quarter earnings will be less than the
second quarter's 12 cents a share while revenues will rise
almost eight mln dlrs over the 1986 third quarter to between 18
and 18.5 mln dlrs.
    Until now, most of the price discounting occurred at the
bottom of the product line in near-supercomputers, but ETA
System's announcement could start squeezing Convex and Alliant
from the top, analysts said.
    ETA, a subsidiary of Control Data Corp <CDC>, introduced
two machines that are really full-blown supercomputers similar
to those sold by Cray Research Inc, the world's biggest
supercomputer maker, but at half the price of Cray's cheapest
model. The ETA-10 Model P costs 995,000 dlrs and the Model Q is
1.2 mln dlrs.
    ETA officials told a news conference the new machines may
be classified as supercomputers but they are aimed directly at
the upper end of the product lines from Alliant and Convex.
    Acceptance of ETA's product could be hampered by lack of
software, analysts said, noting this is an issue that faces all
parallel processor makers to some degree.
    Because parallel processing is a new architecture that has
yet to be widely used, third party software vendors have been
slow to write programs for the near-supercomputers.
    ETA, however, "offers a low priced entry into supercomputers
for some customers," one consultant said.
    Canin cautioned that "the price pressures will continue for
some time" and estimated that five percentage points have been
knocked off the gross profit margins of both Convex and Alliant
this year by price discounting.
    Next year, he said, the two companies will face a new set
of problems as they both introduce their second generation of
products. "I am always cautious about the first major product
transition."
