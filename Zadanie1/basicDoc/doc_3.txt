The Roy Disney family disclosed in a
filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it made
a bid to acquire Holly Sugar Corp for a package of cash and
securities.
    Shamrock Holdings of California Inc, a Disney family
company, said it submitted the bid on April 8 to Salomon
Brothers Inc, Holly Sugar's investment banker.
    The offer was for 45 dlrs in cash, securities with a face
value of 70 dlrs, and a "contingent payment certificate" that
would pay out as much as 70 dlrs over a 20-year period for each
share of Holly Sugar outstanding.
    The Disney family already holds 101,300 Holly Sugar shares
or 9.0 pct of the total outstanding following purchases of
12,500 shares March 13-April 17, Shamrock told the SEC.
    Shamrock said it had asked for certain information about
Holly Sugar's financial condition but had been turned down. It
said its offer was therefore subject to further discussions.
    "Once we have had an opportunity to complete our due
diligence evaluation of the company, including inspections of
certain facilities and meetings with key management personnel,
we would be prepared to negotiate all aspects of our proposal,
including price," it said in its April 8 letter.

greater than expected, FCOJ traders and analysts said.
    The USDA projected an average yield of 1.50 gallons of FCOJ
per box versus last month's estimate of 1.47 gallons.
    The government estimated Florida orange production
(excluding Temples) at 122.9 mln boxes versus 124 mln last
month. Temples were unchanged at 3.4 mln boxes.
    Traders and analysts said the unexpectedly large yield
increase outweighed the anticipated drop in box count.

<Noranda Inc> said it began salvage
operations at its Murdochville, Quebec, mine, where a fire last
week killed one miner and caused 10 mln dlrs in damage.
     Another 56 miners were trapped underground for as long as
24 hours before they were brought to safety.
    Noranda said the cause and full extent of the damage is
still unknown but said it does know that the fire destroyed
6,000 feet of conveyor belt.
     Noranda said work crews have begun securing the ramp
leading into the zone where the fire was located. The company
said extreme heat from the fire caused severe rock degradation
along several ramps and drifts in the mine.
     Noranda estimated that the securing operation for the zone
will not be completed before the end of April.
    Noranda said the Quebec Health and Safety Commission, the
Quebec Provincial Police and Noranda itself are each conducting
an investigation into the fire.
    Production at the mine has been suspended until the
investigations are complete. The copper mine and smelter
produced 72,000 tons of copper anodes in 1986 and employs 680
people.
     The smelter continues to operate with available
concentrate from stockpiled supplies, Noranda said.

The United States' dependency on
foreign oil sources may reach record levels by the mid-1990s,
according to John H. Lichtblau, president of Petroleum Industry
Research Associates.
    Lichtblau, speaking at an alternative energy conference
here, said the U.S. may depend on foreign suppliers for as much
as 52 pct of its oil by 1995, surpasssing the previous high
level of 47 pct in 1977.
    "The long term growth in dependency on foreign oil is
inevitable," Lichtblau said. As much as 30 pct of U.S. oil
imports in 1995 could come from OPEC nations, he said.
    Lichtblau said the U.S. depended on foreign suppliers for
33 pct of its oil in 1986 and predicted that would increase to
40 pct by 1990.
    "However, the rate of this growth can be affected
positively or negatively through government action or
inaction," Lichtblau said.
    He said that one of the government's negative actions is
the maintenance of the windfall profits tax which acts as a
disincentive to developing existing fields and reduces cash
flow for oil exploration.
    Lichtblau called for the adoption of an international floor
price for crude oil to help stabilize world oil prices.
    "An international floor price adopted by all or most
industrial countries would clearly be a much more effective
measure and would be much less distortive for the U.S. than if
we imposed it alone," Lichtblau said.
    Development of alternate energy sources such as synthetic
fuels as well as increased development in Alaska could lessen
U.S. dependency on foreign oil, Lichtblau said.
    A potential for alternative supplies could limit the
willingness of OPEC nations to raise oil prices, he said.
    Lichtblau also called for the federal government to offer
tax abatements for oil drilling, to fill the Strategic
Petroleum Reserve at a faster rate and to develop pilot plans
for alternative energy.

AMR Corp's American Airlines will start
its own information campaign in its dispute with the
Association of Professional Flight Attendants.
    The company, which has been negotiating with its 10,000
attendants since late last year, will give out information
brochures at its terminals, outlining its position, according
to L.C. Duncan Jr., vice president of corporate communications.
    During a news conference, Duncan said the APFA was
conducting a "smear campaign" by handing out leaflets at the
company's terminals. The union says it was trying to win public
support by presenting its position.
     Last month, American fired 20 flight attendants for
handing out the leaflets at Dallas-Fort Worth Airport. The
union is fighting the move in court.
     In response to a question, Duncan said the company's
latest proposal for a new three-year contract, which was
offered March 11, does away with a two-tiered system of pay,
whereby new employees are paid on a lower scale than those
hired before 1983.
     However, the union has contended that the company's
proposal keeps the system in a disguised form.
     A union spoksewoman had no immediate response to
American's announcement.
     Currently, the airline and the union are in the middle of
a federally-mandated 30-day cooling off period that was
triggered after both sides rejected a federal mediator's offer
of binding arbitration.
     When the period ends on April 25, the union is free to
strike and the company is free to unilaterally impose its
latest offer under the Federal Railway Labor Act.
     Even though the union has repeatedly said it will not
strike, Duncan confirmed today that the company has received
permission from the Federal Aviation Administration to speed up
the hiring of new attendants.
     In response to a question, Duncan denied the company was
thinking of firing attendants who do not comply after the 25th.
     "It (the speeded-up hiring) is a precautionary measure,"
he said.

U.S. bank discount window borrowings
less extended credits averaged 361 mln dlrs a day in the week
to Wednesday, April 8, the Federal Reserve said.
    Total daily borrowings in the week fell 99 mln dlrs to 591
mln dlrs, with extended credits down 35 mln dlrs at 230 mln
dlrs. The week was the second half of the two-week statement
period that ended Wednesday. Net borrowings averaged 425 mln
dlrs in the first week of the period.
    Commenting on the two-week statement period that ended on
April 8, the Fed said banks had average net free reserves of
447 mln dlrs.
    A Fed spokesman told a press conference that there were no
large one-day net misses in the Fed's estimates of reserves in
the week ended Wednesday.
    Of the week's borrowings, money center banks accounted for
65 pct, and small banks for almost 35 pct. On Wednesday, when
net borrowings were 1.36 billion dlrs and Fed funds averaged a
high 6.45 pct, money center banks accounted for more than 90
pct of the borrowing.
    Borrowings in the latest two weeks averaged 393 mln dlrs a
day, the highest since the statement period ended January 28.
    Float ranged from about 250 mln dlrs on Thursday to between
one and 1.25 billion dlrs on Monday and Tuesday.
    The spokesman said Monday's float included 500 mln dlrs in
holdover float at one Fed branch due to mechanical problems.
    About 500 mln dlrs of Tuesday's float reflected
non-weather-related transportation float in one Eastern Reserve
bank.
    As-of adjustments ranged from minus 500 mln dlrs on Monday,
when cash letter errors at two eastern reserve banks were
corrected, to plus 500 mln dlrs on Thursday, when a correction
was made to unposted funds at a single bank.
    In the first half of the statement period ended Wednesday,
banks held excess reserves on the first four days of the week
but ran a deficit on Wednesday.
    In the second week, they ran a deficit on Thursday, Friday
and Monday but held excess reserves on the final two days.

LTV Corp said it will seek approval from
the U.S. bankruptcy court to make one-time hardship payments to
retired steelworkers who lost some pension benefits when their
retirement plans were terminated.
    The payments would range from 100 dlrs to 750 dlrs per
person for more than 9,800 steel company salaried and hourly
retirees, LTV said.
    The company's steel unit retirement plans were terminated
in January by the federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp, which
said the plans were insolvent.
    LTV filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy last July 17.
    Under Chapter 11, a company is protected from creditors
while it works out a plan to pay debts.
    While most regular pension payments were continued after
LTV Steel Co's pension plans were terminated, some retirees got
a reduction in their supplemental early retirement benefits or
other payments that were more than maximums guaranteed by the
federal agency.
    LTV also began talks with the United Steelworkers union,
and both sides have made a commitment to reach a new labor
agreement by May 1, the steel, aerospace and energy concern
said.
    LTV has the right to renegotiate its labor contracts while
operating in Chapter 11. At issue are pension and health
benefits for active and retired employees and other items, such
as use of manpower and equipment.
    The company plans to present a comprehensive proposal to
the U.S. bankruptcy court in May to deal with pensions and
health care benefits for steel and energy retirees and health
care benefits for aerospace retirees, it said.
    All LTV retirees are currently receiving health and life
insurance payments mandated by federal laws passed in October

Treasury Secretary James Baker said
the floating exchange rate system has not been as effective as
had been hoped in promoting stability and preventing imbalances
from emerging in the global economy.
    In remarks before the afternoon session of the
International Monetary Fund's Interim Committee, Baker said he
was not suggesting that the system should be abandoned.
    "But I do suggest," he said, "that we need something to give
it more stability and to keep it headed in the right direction
when the wind shifts."
    He said that indicators can serve "as a kind of compass" but
added that structural indicators can help focus attention on
some policies.
    Baker, however, said the IMF "needs to move beyond
macroeconomic indicators and find structural indicators that
can help focus attention on some of the policies of specific
relevance to the imbalances we face today."
    The Treasury Secretary said that indicators should be given
a more prominent role in the annual economic reviews -- Article
IV consultations -- that the Fund performs.
    Baker also told the policy making group that it was time
for the IMF to adopt earlier recommendations making IMF
surveillance more relevant to national policymakers and the
public.
    "In particular, we urge increased publicity for IMF
appraisals developed in Article IV consultations, the use of
follow-up reports on country actions to implement IMF
recommendations, and greater use of special consultation
procedures," he said.
    Baker emphasized that indicators were a device "for moving
beyond rhetoric to action."
    He said they provide "more structure to the system, and
induce more discipline and peer pressure into the process of
policy coordination."
    He said the Fund's procedures for surveillance need to be
reviewed and updated to reflect the use of indicators.
    "This should be matter of priority for the executive board,"
he said.
    Baker also urged the Fund to develop alternative
medium-term economic scenarios for countries that "can help us
focus even more clearly on the most important imbalances, by
identifying options for addressing them and analyzing the
implications of these options."
    He said also that further work should be done on finding
paths that lead toward possible medium-term objectives.
    "If we are to take effective remedial action when there are
significant deviations from an intended course, then we must
have more definitive ways of indentifying the right course for
key variables," he said.

Commodities from gold to grains to
cotton posted solid gains in a flurry of buying today as losses
in the U.S. dollar and rising interest rates kindled fears of
inflation and economic instability.
    Gains were most pronounced on the Commodity Exchange in New
York, where gold jumped 12.40 dlrs and closed at 436.50 dlrs a
troy ounce, and silver 22.5 cents to 6.86 dlrs a troy ounce.
    A key factor behind the advance was anticipation that
inflation will be the only way for the major industrial nations
to halt the slide in the value of the U.S. dollar, said Steve
Chronowitz, director of commodity research with Smith Barney,
Harris Upham and Co., in New York.
    The dollar tumbled one day after top finance officials from
the seven largest industrial nations reaffirmed their
commitment to support its value, and despite reports of
intervention by the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, traders said.
    Traders said it appears that the industrial nations, known
as the Group of Seven, lack the ability to change the long-term
direction of the currency markets.
    "Maybe they have some ideas or plans," said Chronowitz. "If
they do, it's not evident."
    "It looks like there's no cure but to let the free market
take values to where they should be.
    "One way or another, we will force our major trading
partners to stimulate their economies," as a measure to correct
the mounting U.S. trade deficit, Chronowitz said.
    "I think the markets believe, and have believed for a long
time, that the only recourse is to reflate at some point. It's
going to be a long and tedious process, but that's what's
happening," he said.
    The falling value of the dollar makes U.S. commodities
cheaper for foreign buyers, stimulating demand.
    At the same time, traders who are holding stocks and bonds
saw the value of their investments falling and many are turning
to commodities such as precious metals as a hedge, said Marty
McNeill, a metals analyst in New York with the trading house of
Dominick and Dominick.
    The reaction in the metal markets reverberated throughout
the commodities markets, as grains, livestock, and cotton
posted broad gains.
    Traders at the Chicago Board of Trade said attention in the
grain markets has shifted from concern about burdensome
supplies to the outlook that a lower dollar will stimulate
export demand.
    After the close of trading, the Agriculture Department
raised its estimate for grain imports by the Soviet Union by
two mln tonnes from the month-earlier report.
    Live hogs and frozen pork bellies posted sharp gains on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while live cattle were moderately
higher.
    Analysts said several factors boosted hog prices. They said
hogs haven't been making the weight gains that are normal at
this time of year, and farmers have been too busy with field
work to market animals.

Moore Corp Ltd expects 1987 profits from
continuing operations will exceed 1986 results and recover to
1985 levels when the company earned 152 mln U.S. dlrs or 1.70
dlrs a share, president M. Keith Goodrich said.
    "We'll have a substantial increase in earnings from
continuing operations," he told reporters after the annual
meeting. He said he expected profits would recover last year's
lost ground and reach 1985 results.
    In 1986, profits from continuing operations slumped to
139.5 mln dlrs or 1.54 dlrs a share. The total excluded losses
of 30 mln dlrs on discontinued operations.
    Goodrich said Moore is still actively looking for
acquisitions related to its core areas of business forms
manufacturing or handling.
    "We could do a large acquisition," he said when asked if
the company could raise as much as one billion dlrs for this
purpose.
    Chairman Judson Sinclair, answering a shareholder's
question, told the annual meeting that a special resolution
passed by shareholders to create a new class of preferred
shares would allow Moore to move quickly if it decided to
pursue an acquisition.

The Semiconductor Industry
Association put the three-month average book-to-bill ratio at
1.21, which was above analysts' expectations and reflects the
sixth straight increase in this indicator of computer industry
activity.
    Average booking in the three month period ended in March
totaled 910.8 mln dlrs, up 15.6 pct from a month ago and the
highest bookings since September, 1984. March billings, or
computer chip sales in the month, totaled 912.1 mln dlrs, up
34.6 pct from a month ago, the association said. The three
month average billings totaled 751.3 mln dlrs, up 6.5 pct.
    March billings were the strongest recorded since November,
1984, the association said. The book to bill ratio, at 1.21,
was the highest since May, 1984, it noted.
    Preliminary total solid state shipments for the first
quarter of 1987 totaled 2.25 billion dlrs, up 4.9 pct from last
quarter and up 15.9 pct from last year's first quarter.
    Semiconductor Industry Association President Andrew
Procassini said the rise in the book to bill was due to a
substantial increase in U.S. bookings during March.
    "We believe that the bookings increase reflects growing
confidence by electronic equipment manufacturers that some
end-equipment market segments have improved substantially
during the first quarter," Procassini said in a statement.
    The association also revised its book-to-bill ratio
estimate for the three months ended in February to 1.12, from
1.13 earlier. It further revised the January book-to-bill
figure to 1.09 from 1.12 estimated earlier.
    The three-month average book-to-bill ratio of 1.21 for
March means for every 100 dlrs worth of product shipped,
computer chip maker received 121 dlrs in new orders.
    Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc analyst Michael Gumport said
association numbers indicate March orders were up 20 pct above
the normal seasonal level.
    The association does not break out March orders from its
three-month average, which it put at 910.8 mln dlrs.
    Gumport noted the three-month average bookings were well
above the 800-865 mln dlrs anticipated by the industry.
    He said semiconductor stock could rise five to ten pct on
the stock market open tomorrow, due to the positive numbers.
    "Skeptics are going to have to have some pretty strong
reasons not to like this group (of stocks)," Gumport said.
    Kidder Peabody and Co analyst Michael Kubiak said the ratio
indicates March orders at about one billion dlrs, which would
be the highest monthly order rate since April, 1984.
    He predicted at least a five pct rise in semiconductor
stocks on the open, and said the stock group could soar as high
as 15 pct during the session.
    "One month does not a boom-time make, but this is very good
news," he said.
    Kubiak attributed the stong semiconductor orders to
strength in the personal computer market, inventory restocking
and strong buying by distributors.
    Purchasing managers had been keeping computer chip
inventories low, due to the overcapacity in the industry and
the slow growth of the economy in general, analysts noted.
    The semiconductor industry has been in a slump for the past
three years.
    The analysts said the March order and sales numbers are the
strongest evidence yet that the trend may be turning.
    Nevertheless, they do not expect the Administration to
retreat from proposed sanctions against Japanese chip makers.
    They added, however, if the industry continues to improve,
it could mean the sanctions will be short term.
    Jack Beedle, President of In-Stat, an electronics industry
research firm, called the March numbers "excellent", but also
cautioned against excessive optimism.
    "I still believe caution should be the word, rather than
euphoria," said Beedle, adding that he has yet to see strong
indications from the general economy or the computer industry
that support a solid, long-term recovery.
    Beedle said while he thinks the semiconductor industry will
have a very good second quarter, he still thinks positive
shifts in exports and industrial production are needed to
sustain a recovery.

Elements of the drug industry endangered
the lives of children by pressuring the government to delay a

    The warning involving Reye's Syndrome has since been
required on aspirin products under a Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) directive of one year ago, and now appears
on the labels of aspirin and aspirin-containing products.
    The industry under government coaxing began voluntarily
printing warning labels in mid-1985.
   
    But in an editorial in this week's Journal of the
American Medical Association, Dr Edward Mortimer of Case
Western Reserve University in Cleveland said some aspirin
manufacturers misled physicians and acted irresponsibly in
opposing the warning for several years before then.
    Mortimer's criticism was prompted by a new government study
published in the same issue of the Journal which said it had
found a "strong association" between aspirin and Reye's Syndrome.
    Reye's Syndrome, which kills about 20 per cent of its
victims, strikes following chicken pox, influenza and other 
illnesses. Symptoms include lethargy, belligerence and
excessive vomiting. Those who survive sometimes suffer brain

Mobil Corp Chairman Allen E. Murray said
the company's exploration and production budget would not be
increased in the foreseeable future as it is "operating on the
assumption that (oil) prices will remain on the lower end of
the spectrum.
     "Our budget is at about the same level as it was last year
and I think it is the right amount," said Murray who was in
town for ceremonies celebrating the consolidation of Mobil's
domestic exploration and production operations into a new,
locally-based subsidiary.
     Last year, Mobil spent a total of 2.13 billion dlrs on
exploration and production, 341 mln dlrs in the United States
and 1.79 billion overseas.
     Murray said the new subsidiary, Mobil Exploration and
Production U.S. Inc., was not created as "part of any cost
saving effort" but instead to "increase our efficiency and
ability to stay ahead of the pack."
     The consolidation will, however, save Mobil about 15 mln
dlrs annually once relocation and reorganization costs have
been absorbed, according to A.F. Stancell, vice president of
U.S. producing operations for the company.
     Mobil, the nation's second largest oil company, responded
to the collapse of oil prices last year -- from 30 dlrs a
barrel at end-1985 to as low as 10 dlrs in mid-1986 -- by
laying off 5,500 people and cutting its budget in midyear by 27
percent, or 1.1 billion dlrs.
     Of that amount, more than 900 mln dlrs was eliminated from
its exploration and spending spending plans.
     But the company reported an increase in profits in 1986
over 1985 and a jump in per share earnings to 3.45 dlrs a share
from 2.55 dlrs.

Treasury Secretary James Baker said
that commercial banks need to develop more flexibility in their
concerted lending mechanisms "to help assure continued
participation in new money packages."
    He said that major debtor nations need to be able to count
on receiving timely disbursements on new loans essential to
support well-conceived economic programs.
    His remarks were made to the afternoon session of the
International Monetary Fund's policy making Interim Committee.
    Baker said, "The sense of urgency and willingness to
cooperate in support of a larger general interest that helped
to carry us through the difficult crisis period of 1982 and
1983 is now less evident."
    He said to address this problem, it is important for the
commercial banks to "develop a menu of alternative new money 
options from which all banks with debt exposure can choose in
providing continuing support for debtor reforms."
    He said the "continued implementation of the debt strategy
may well rest on their doing so."
    Baker also said that growth prospects for the lowest income
countries remain an issue of "critical concern to the United
States."
    He said that he intended to address the problem of poor
country prospects in greater detail at tomorrow's meeting of
the joint IMF-World Bank Devlopment Committee.
    Baker said, however, that ministers should guard against
what appear to be magical solutions to the complex debt
problem.
    "I want to stress the need for all to guard against the
ephemeral attraction of magical solutions, which may appear as
tantalizing alternatives to the rigorous realities of grappling
with our debt problems," he said.
    But he emphasized that the only lasting progress is to
approach each situation on a case-by-case basis, "bringing to
bear the policies and financing needed to bring the economy

Economists said that they doubt the
Federal Reserve is firming policy to aid the dollar, despite
higher discount window borrowings in the latest two-week
statement period and very heavy borrowings Wednesday.
    Data out today show net borrowings from the Fed averaged
393 mln dlrs in the two weeks to Wednesday, up from 265 mln
dlrs in the prior statement period. Wednesday borrowings were
1.4 billion dlrs as Federal funds averaged a high 6.45 pct.
    "One could make a case that the Fed is firming, but it
probably isn't," said William Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds.
    Sullivan said some may assume the Fed has firmed policy
modestly to support the dollar because net borrowings in the
two-weeks to Wednesday were nearly 400 mln dlrs after averaging
around 250 mln dlrs over the previous two months.
    However, the Dean Witter economist noted that the latest
two-week period included a quarter end when seasonal demand
often pushes up borrrowings.
    "Some might argue that the Fed was firming policy, but it
looks like it tried to play catchup with reserve provisions
late in the statement period and didn't quite make it," said
Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
    A Fed spokesman told a press press conference today that
the Fed had no large net one-day miss of two billion dlrs or
more in its reserve projections in the week ended Wednesday.
    Still, McCarthy said it may have had a cumulative miss in
its estimates over the week that caused it to add fewer
reserves earlier in the week than were actually needed.
    The Fed took no market reserve management action last
Thursday and Friday, the first two days of the week. It added
temporary reserves indirectly on Monday via two billion dlrs of
customer repurchase agreements and then supplied reserves
directly via System repurchases on Tuesday and Wednesday.
    Based on Fed data out today, economists calculated that the
two-day System repurchase agreements the Fed arrranged on
Tuesday totaled around 5.9 billion dlrs. They put Wednesday's
overnight System repos at approximately 3.4 billion dlrs.
    "It is quite clear that the Fed is not firming policy at
this time," said Larry Leuzzi of S.G. Warburg and Co Inc.
    Citing the view shared by the other two economists, Leuzzi
said the Fed cannot really afford to seriously lift interest
rates to help the dollar because that would harm already weak
economies in the United States and abroad and add to the
financial stress of developing countries and their lenders.
    "Those who believe the Fed tightened policy in the latest
statement period have to explain why it acted before the dollar
tumbled," said McCarthy of Merrill Lynch.
    He said the dollar staged a precipitous drop as a new
statement period began today on disappointment yesterday's
Washington meetings of international monetary officials failed
to produce anything that would offer substantive dollar aid.
    In fact, currency dealers said there was nothing in
Wednesday's G-7 communique to alter the prevailing view that
the yen needs to rise further to redress the huge trade
imbalance between the United States and Japan.
    The economists generally agreed that the Fed is aiming for
steady policy now that should correspond to a weekly average
Fed funds rate between six and 6-1/8 pct. This is about where
the rate has been since early November.
    "I'm not so sure that the Fed is engineering a tighter
policy to help the dollar, as some suspect," said Sullivan of
Dean Witter.
    If it is, however, he said that Fed probably has just
nudged up its funds rate goal to around 6.25 to 6.35 pct from
six to 6.10 pct previously.

The Administration's 15 billion dlr
plan to recapitalize the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance
Corporation is needed to ensure the future profitablity of the
U.S. thrift industry, according to a top industry regulator.
    "Today thrifts in overwhelming numbers are profitable," 
Shannon Fairbanks, executive chief of staff of the Federal Home
Loan Bank Board told a thrift industry conference.
    "But every thrift is paying a market tax for the inabliity
of regulators to deal with problems carried forward from the
past," she said, referring to the premium that thrifts have to
pay in the marketplace to entice deposits away from banks.
    "The industry wants to see a five billion dlr plan passed
now, and then to wait and see what happens," Fairbanks said.
"They're saying, 'we don't want to pay more right away.' The
argument is that it's a drain on the industry."
    "But the dollars paid out can be recaptured in the
reduction in the market tax differential," she said. "The cost
of recapitalization to the industry would be recaptured in
bottom line profitability."
    Fairbanks said that the public's confidence in thrift
instititutions eroded with the financial difficulties of
savings and loan associations in Ohio and Maryland in 1985.
    As thrift institutions in economically distressed areas
like Texas have continued to fall on hard times, this has
increased depositors' demand for a higher premium on deposits
in savings and loans compared with premiums paid on deposits in
commercial banks, she said.
    Before 1983, thrift institutions paid a 25 basis point
yield differential on savings deposits over that offered by
commercial banks as mandated by U.S. financial regulations.
    With the elimination in 1983 of regulations that had drawn
strict lines between savings and loans and commercial banks,
the gap widened to as much as 50 to 75 basis points as wary
depositors demanded a higher premium to place their funds in
thrift institutions, Fairbanks said.
    "The market tax paid by today's thrift industry is the most
significant impediment to future profits," she said.
    Depositor confidence is also eroded by the existence of
thrifts that are failing but manage to stay in business by
paying deposit rates well above prevailing market rates.
    Presently, the FHLBB cannot afford to close failing
institiutions "because we can't afford it with the current
FSLIC fund," she said.
    Fairbanks estimated that the high market tax differential
paid by thrifts will drop by at least 10 to 20 basis points
with an adequate recapitalization of FSLIC because it will help
restore this lost confidence.

dealers said.
    The previous record low was 144.70 yen set on March 30. The
opening compares with 143.90/144.00 yen at the close in New

    The central bank bought dollars through Tokyo brokers just

Today's turmoil in the U.S. Financial
markets, with bond and stock prices tumbling in the dollar's
wake, is evidence of a major shift in investor psychology that
is likely to spell more turbulence ahead, economists said.
    For two years, the markets had hailed the dollar's decline
as the cure-all for the U.S. Trade deficit. Interest rates fell
sharply and Wall Street became a one-way street, up.
    But that confidence is now cracking as the financial
markets suddenly believe Fed chairman Paul Volcker's
often-repeated warnings about the risks of a dollar collapse.
    "Volcker's been saying for a long time that a dollar
freefall would be extremely dangerous - now he's got it," said
David Jones, economist at Aubrey G. Lanston and Co Inc.
    The dollar fell below 144 yen today for the first time in
40 years as the Group of Seven finance ministers in Washington
failed to convince the foreign exchange market that they have a
credible strategy for redressing global trade imbalances, short
of further depreciation of the dollar.
    Bonds suffered their biggest one-day drop in months amid
worries that the dollar's slide will rekindle inflation, scare
away foreign investors and force the Fed to tighten credit.
    The inflationary fears boosted gold bullion by more than 12
dlrs to a 1987 high of 432.20/70 dlrs an ounce, while the spike
in interest rates pulled the Dow Jones Industrial Average down
by 33 points to 2339.
    Norman Robertson, Mellon Bank chief economist, called the
markets' instability frightening. He believes economic
fundamentals do not justify the bearishness but said that "once
you start the ball rolling it's difficult to stop."
    "There's a stark possibility that you could get a
destabilizing drop in the dollar that forces up interest rates
and drives us into recession. The markets are in a panic."
    Stephen Marris of the Institute for International Economics
in Washington, has been warning for a long time that the
controlled decline of the dollar since peaks of 3.47 marks and
264 yen in February 1985 could turn into a nightmare.
    "We're still more or less on track for a hard landing... But
the agony may be fairly drawn out," Marris told

Two Utah financial institutions, the
Bank of Iron County and Summit Savings and Loan Association,
have failed, official spokesmen said.
    The board of directors of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (FDIC) has approved the assumption of the deposit
liabilities of Bank of Iron County, Parowan, Utah, by Dixie
State Bank, St George, Utah, an FDIC spokesman said.
    The bank, which had total assets of 20.1 mln dlrs, was the
first bank in Utah to fail this year and the 59th nationwide.
    Its three offices will reopen Monday as branches of Dixie
State Bank and its depositors will automatically become
depositors of the assuming bank.
    Dixie State Bank will assume about 19.9 mln dlrs in 6,300
deposit accounts and will purchase all of the failed bank's
assets at a discount of 3.575 mln dlrs.
    The Federal Home Loan Bank Board closed Summit Savings and
Loan Association, Park City, Utah, and directed the Federal
Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC) to transfer an
estimated 116.9 mln dlrs in insured deposits to United Savings
and Loan Association, Ogden, Utah, an FSLIC spokesman said.
    Summit, a 120.8 mln dlr institution, was insolvent, the
spokesman said. The bank board appointed the FSLIC as
conservator for the association on April 14, 1986.
    Summit has since operated as part of the bank board's
Management Consignment Program. United Savings has 205 mln dlrs
in assets and nine offices in Utah, and one in Idaho.

A committee of the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank said protectionist
agricultural policies of industrial countries were a major
cause of depressed global commodity prices.
    The joint Development Committee, in a communique released
following day-long discussions, said an improved environment
for commodities was extremely important to the long-term
viability of developing countries.
    The committee also criticised the slow-down in lending to
debtor nations.
    Poorer countries, which rely primarily on raw commodity
sales to industrial nations to pay their debts, have been
highly critical of protectionist agricultural policies in the
United States, Western Europe and Japan.
    "Ministers identified protectionist agricultural policies as
a major cause of distortions including depressed commodity
prices on world markets, of surplus production and of budgetary
drain," the communique said.
    The communique, delayed because of disputes over specific
language, was the final statement by the IMF and the bank after
week-long semi-annual meetings of the two lending agencies.
    Earlier, the IMF's powerful Interim Committee added its
voice to growing criticism of delays by commercial banks on
critically needed loan packages for debt-laden developing
countries.
    The committee said it welcomed the exploration of new
procedures and financing techniques that will help mobilise new
financial support for indebted countries.
    On Thursday, U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker, in a
statement to the policy-making committee, said commercial bank
lending to debtor nations last year was disappointing and more
flexibility in loan programs was needed.
    "Doubts about financing can clearly undermine the resolve to
carry out needed reforms," Baker said.
    The Development Committee also joined in the criticism,
noting that there had been a declining flow of capital to the
developing countries that "has been particularly significant in
the case of flows from commercial banks."
    A number of bank negotiations are bogged down over details
including financial packages for Mexico, Nigeria and Argentina.
    The banks, acknowledging it has been difficult to complete
deals, say part of the blame goes to the developing countries
for not making sufficient reform to make them good credit
risks.

Texaco Inc <TX> said its decision to
file for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy
code will not affect the majority of its businesses.
    It said its subsidiaries, which account for 96 pct of its
32.6 billion dlrs in revenues and 79 pct of its net property,
plant and equipment, were free of the action.
    Only parent holding company, Texaco Inc, and operating
subsidiaries, Texaco Capital Inc and Texaco Capital N.V, are
affected, it said.
    But the company said it was likely to suspend its 75 cents
per share quarterly common stock dividend and halt repayments
on debts of some 6.8 billion dlrs.
    Texaco said it filed for Chaper 11 because suppliers were
demanding cash payments and banks were withholding loans as a
result of a legal dispute with Pennzoil Co <PZL>.
    Texaco is fighting a Texas law requiring it to post a bond
of more than 10 billion dlrs before it can appeal a 1985
judgment that ruled it illegally interfered with Pennzoil's
1984 acquisition of Getty Petroleum Corp <GTY>. The bond almost
matches the damages awarded against Texaco.
    Should Texaco fail to place the bond, Pennzoil could begin
to attach its assets to secure the judgment.
    Last Monday, the Supreme Court overturned a decision to cut
Texaco's bond to one billion dlrs, and sent the issue back to
the Texas courts.
    Analysts said the bankruptcy filing effectively froze all
Texaco's obligations while it continued to appeal the merits of
the Pennzoil lawsuit.
    "Attempts last week to win a compromise on both the bond
issue and the larger dispute failed," James Kinnear, Texaco's
president and chief executive officer, told reporters.
    Kinnear said Pennzoil's disclosure in court papers on
Friday that it wanted to extend the bond issue hearing until
the end of April, pushed Texaco further towards Chapter 11.
    Pennzoil had asked Texaco to post a 5.6 billion dlr cash
bond and to reduce its dividend to not more than 50 pct of
earnings. Pennzoil also wanted assurances that Texaco would not
sell any assets, Kinnear said.
    Texaco offered to put up one billion dlrs in a letter of
credit and agreed not to let the value of its assets fall under
11.1 billion dlrs, he added.
    Joseph Jamail, a Houston attorney for Pennzoil, said the
company had made its latest settlement offer to Texaco on
Saturday and was taken by surprise when Texaco filed for
bankruptcy.
    He declined to reveal the amount of the proposal, citing a
confidentiality agreement between the two companies. "Texaco
told us they would get back to us but instead they chose to go
to bankruptcy court," Jamail said.
    Attorneys for Pennzoil said they believed the company would
prevail in court appeals, adding that Texaco's assets were
ample ultimately to pay the Pennzoil judgment in full.

West Germany's capital market
liberalization program has stalled and bankers are worried it
may take years for further reforms to be completed.
    Liberalization got underway in May 1985 when foreign banks
received Bundesbank permission to lead-manage mark eurobonds.
    Further moves included introduction of mark-denominated
certificates of deposit last year. But other changes, including
revisions in the domestic options market and introduction of
futures contracts, need lengthy statutory changes and this may
take years, bankers and dealers say.
    Deutsche Bank AG co-chairman F. Wilhelm Christians called
last week for an enlargement of current capital market
instruments to include instruments already standard abroad.
    He said these are needed especially when prices fall,
citing declines in West German share prices in the first two
months of this year when stock indices fell about 20 pct.
    Others are more blunt. Securities dealers say the lack of
viable hedging instruments for shares and bonds makes trading
in domestic markets too risky.
    "We need a stock index futures contract, and a futures
contract for recent government bonds," one dealer said.
    West Germany now has options contracts on about five pct of
shares and bonds traded on exchanges here, covering only about
30 pct of the average traded volume, stock market sources said.
    Options can only be written on the original 14 bonds
selected when bond options were introduced last April. The most
recent bond on the list was issued in 1985.
    There are no futures exchanges in West Germany. German
banks may participate in futures exchanges through branches
abroad but these are at least outwardly subject to stringent
West German rules requiring that every contract be secured on a
one-by-one basis with a separate hedge, to prevent speculation.
    Another problem is a lack of liquidity in the existing
markets, owing to lack of private investor participation.
    Private individuals and corporations do not engage in
options trading now due to West Germany's civil and exchange
laws, which define losses made in futures and options business
as gambling losses, which investors need not pay back.
    Options business has been hurt by lack of liquidity from
pension funds, which currently are forbidden to invest in these
instruments. But they are to be allowed to enter the business
soon as the European Community begins to harmonize rules
governing funds.
    Manfred Laux, general secretary of the West German mutual
funds association in Frankfurt, said harmonized rules are to be
adopted by October 1, 1989 at the latest.
    The push to adopt new instruments has not been great in the
past, owing to wide-spread belief they are speculative, which
gives them a bad name in West Germany. But pressure for their
introduction here is growing.
    The start-up of a Swiss futures exchange has some bankers
considering if a similar exchange would be useful in West
Germany. They say that without innovations, some business could
drift to London, which the Bundesbank vehemently opposes.
    An official at the London International Financial Futures
Exchange (LIFFE) said the exchange currently has no plans to
introduce more mark-denominated contracts beyond the existing
mark-dollar contract. But he said the exchange is studying the
feasibility of other contracts, including one for three-month
mark interest rates and possibly a government bond contract.
    A Bundesbank capital markets expert said the Bundesbank has
no objections to hedging through futures but any liberalization
in that sector is still in the early planning stages after
earlier talks ended two years ago.
    Considerations about the futures business have been drawn
out because of the large number of participants involved in
talks. They include parliament, the Bundesbank, the Federal
Banking Supervisory Board, eight West German stock exchanges
and their governing states, and the four West German banking
associations.
    Beyond options and futures, other changes being suggested
include replacing the federal government's current bond
consortium with an auction procedure similar to one being
considered in the U.K. And already in practice in the U.S.
    This would upset the existing market order providing German
and foreign banks in the consortium with fixed quotas but it
would eliminate the misallocations some bankers say presently
arise within the fixed consortium quota system.
    In addition, some bankers would like the method of bond
trading on the West German stock exchange changed to a system
of continuous price-setting from the current system in which
every bond price is fixed once a day.
    This would make trading more transparent if it reduced the
proportion of off-floor interbank bond trading, now some 90 pct
of the volume of bond transactions here, the bankers say.

Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro
Nakasone's unpopular plan to introduce a sales tax caused an
electoral setback for his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)
in Sunday's local elections, political analysts said.
    The LDP retained its 11 prefectural governorships, but
failed to restore a governorship in Fukuoka it had placed much
importance on winning. In the prefectural assembly elections to
fill 2,670 seats, the LDP has so far lost 92 of its previously
held 1,487 seats to the socialists and communists.
    Full election results should be available later today.
    Discussing the election results with reporters, Nakasone
said, "I wouldn't say the proposed five pct sales tax had no
effect at all, but there were other factors, such as a low
turnout and unusually cold weather."
    The Home Affairs Ministry said the average turnout for the
13 gubernatorial elections was a record low 59.78 pct while the
prefectural assembly polls drew an average of 66.66 pct, also a
record low.
    Noboru Goto, president of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and
Industry and a longtime friend of Nakasone, told reporters the
impact of the sales tax on the LDP's setback was obvious.
    "The government should take action (on the sales tax) in
regard to the people's wishes," Goto said.
    Nakasone and other LDP leaders have already hinted at a
delay in the implementation of the tax, which had been
scheduled for next January, and a possible cut in the rate.
    "The most important thing now is to get parliamentary
approval of the budget as soon as possible to arrest a rapid
appreciation of the yen," Nakasone said. "We must implement
measures to prop up the economy."
    Opposition parties said the elections were a referendum on
the tax and they will continue to demand its retraction.

significantly up on last year in all divisions.
    It said there were good opportunities for growth in both

by acquisition in related areas.
    It earlier announced a 6.1 mln stg rise in pre-tax profit
to 24.8 mln stg for the year to December 28. Turnover rose to
242.1 mln from 211.5 mln.
    Most of its companies performed well despite a slowdown in

mln stg, it noted.
    Morgan said although profits in the electronics sector
improved to 1.0 mln stg from 100,000 stg previously, results
were nonetheless disappointing.
    Sales were lower than expected, due mainly to delayed
defence orders and cancellations. However, it said it had taken

now proceeding with the delivery of major delayed orders.
    Morgan shares firmed two pence to 318p at 0905 GMT from

Euro-medium term notes, a recent
phenomenon in the international capital markets, are hardly
attracting a flood of issuers but investment bankers are doing
their best to breath life into the market.
    Medium term notes (MTNs) have met with staggering success
in the U.S. Market where total outstandings have grown to
around 50 billion dlrs since 1983, the year they took hold as a
new financing vehicle to bridge the gap between commercial
paper and longer term bonds. Convinced they are here to stay,
investment bankers are attempting to adapt MTNs for the
euromarket.
    Ralph Bunche, a vice president of Morgan Stanley
International, predicted at a recent Euromoney conference on
MTNs here that they will become the predominant instrument for
raising funds in the late 1980's and 1990's. "It (the MTN
market) will even surpass the bond market," he said.
    Other bankers took exception with the degree to which MTNs
will grow. But they generally agreed that these instruments
provide the borrower with greater flexibility and lower costs
than a traditional bond.
    The trick is in convincing European borrowers it is worth
arranging a program and, having accomplished that, to persaude
European investors -- whose preferences differ from their U.S.
Counterparts -- to buy the securities.
    Discussions with bankers proved one thing. No one is
exactly sure how to proceed with structuring and marketing
these issues.
    To date only 13 Euro-MTN programs have been announced but
only a few have been activated, such as those for a unit of
PepsiCo Inc and another for AB Electrolux.
    Several firms have devised different structures for
Euro-MTNs and defend their structures adamantly.
    The PepsiCo notes, for example, are sold on a continuously
offered basis. This involves a small amount of new notes with
similar maturities constantly on offer at current market rates.
    The Electrolux program uses multi-tranche tap notes devised
by Merrill Lynch. Under this structure, an initial tranche of a
minimum 50 mln dlrs has a fixed rate of interest and maturity.
The borrower then issues additional notes in this category up
to a pre-determined maximum.
    Those who defend the continuously offered method, such as
Wendy Dietze, a Salomon Brothers Inc vice president, point to
the flexibility they offer in interest rate and maturity.
    Furthermore, she believes this structure offers the
European investor greater confidence in market liquidity -- a
major concern for these buyers.
    Merrill Lynch Europe Ltd's Kevin Regan defends the
medium-tranche tap notes concept saying it offers comparable
liquidity. But he also said that this structure may not be the
right option for all borrowers.
    Peter Mortimer, a partner in the law firm Milbank, Tweed,
Hadley and McCloy, noted that legal requirements could well
determine which structure is chosen.
    He noted that the tap system allows a more clearly defined
"lock-up" period as each tranche has a specific maturity. In the
case of notes issued by U.S. Borrowers, the "lock-up" period is
the 90 days after the completion of a series during which time
a security cannot be sold back to the U.S. Or to U.S.
Investors.
    However, he said that the Securities and Exchange
Commission is reviewing its current regulations on the
ownership of foreign securities by U.S. Citizens and that some
softening in the rules could come in the not too distant
future.
    For their part borrowers say they feel a bit like guinea
pigs.
    Petter Skouen, executive vice president of the Nordic
Investment Bank (NIB), noted that a few weeks ago NIB would
have said it was disappointed with its Euro-MTN program, but
that the success of a recent issue changed their minds.
    He conceded that in retrospect it would have been wiser to
establish separate programs for the euromarket and the U.S.
Domestic market, rather than try to extend the U.S. Issue
globally. Under NIB's 200 mln dlr program, 100 mln has been
sold in the U.S. And 25 mln in Europe.

The five leading West German economic
research institutes have failed to agree about how strongly the
domestic economy will expand this year but revised down
forecasts contained in a report published six months ago.
    The three research groups of Kiel, Hamburg and Essen
predicted in the institutes' joint spring report that gross
national product (GNP) would rise by two pct in 1987, compared
with 2.4 pct in 1986. The five institutes had jointly forecast
three pct 1987 growth in October last year.
    Taking a dissenting view, the DIW institute of West Berlin
and Munich's Ifo institute predicted only one pct 1987 growth.
    The joint report said that the estimates of economic
development made by the DIW and Ifo were "markedly less
favourable" than those of the other three.
    The DIW and Ifo forecast the economy would pick up after a
slow start to the year. "In the second half of 1987 there will,
however, only be a weak upward movement," they said.
    The two institutes said external economic factors which
were currently damaging exports and pushing up imports would
dominate the economic environment throughout the year. They saw
exports falling by a real 2-1/2 pct in 1987 and predicted no
marked improvement in the course of the year.
    The other three institutes, however, wrote: "The decline in
demand and production (seen) in the winter months does not
indicate the beginning of a cyclical downswing."
    They said the sharp rise of the mark had led to corporate
uncertainty and companies had not carried out investment plans.
But they expected that many investments had not been cancelled
but only put off. "It can be presumed that the braking actions
(on the economy) will diminish markedly this year."
    They added: "The domestic prerequisites for a continuation
of the economic uptrend are still favourable."
    These three institutes said diminishing external burdens
combined with favourable domestic conditions meant an upturn in
demand and production could be expected by the spring.
    However, this projection was clouded by risks including the
further development of the mark against the dollar.
    Contrary to the DIW and Ifo, the three institutes said that
while exports would continue to be the weak point of the
economy in 1987, "there is good reason to believe that exports
will soon bottom out and that a slight rise will emerge during
the course of the year." They predicted an overall 0.5 pct fall
in exports in 1987, the same as in 1986.
    The three more positive institutes saw private consumption
rising by four pct in 1987, compared with 4.2 pct in 1986,
while DIW and Ifo predicted a three pct increase.
    They saw the climate for equipment investment improving but
predicted only a rise of four pct in 1987 against 4.6 pct in
1986. Ifo and DIW saw these investments rising by only two pct.
    All the institutes predicted only a slight decline in
unemployment. The Kiel, Hamburg and Essen institutes said the
jobless total would average 2.17 mln in 1987 compared with 2.23
mln in 1986 and predicted a rise in the number of people in
work of about 200,000.
    These three institutes said new jobs would be created
mainly in the private services sector and also by the state in
the context of job creation measures. The construction industry
was likely to engage new workers for the first time since 1980
but they predicted either no rise in employment in the
manufactured goods industry or only a slight expansion.
    The DIW and Ifo said rises in employment would occur only
in the tertiary sector, while "the number employed in the
manufacturing industry will decline."
    The DIW and Ifo said unemployment would only decline to
2.20 mln in 1987 from 2.23 mln in 1986.
    They saw the current account surplus falling in 1987 to 58
billion marks from 78 billion in 1986. The other three saw a
current account surplus in 1987 of at least 60 billion marks
and predicted that the trade surplus would fall to only around
100 billion marks from 112 billion in 1986.
    The institutes agreed that consumer prices would start to
rise in 1987, after they declined in 1986, and all five
predicted an average increase over the year of 0.5 pct.

Borg-Warner <BOR> Corp, facing an
unwanted offer from GAF Corp <GAF>, agreed to a 4.23 billion
dlr buyout offer from a company to be formed by <Merrill Lynch
Capital Partners Inc>.
    Borg-Warner and Merrill said yesterday they entered a
definitive merger agreement, under which a subsidiary of the
new company, <AV Holdings Corp>, will begin a 48.50 dlr per
share cash tender offer today for 77.6 mln shares or 89 pct of
Borg-Warner common stock.
    The offer will be followed by a merger in which each
remaining share will be converted into 19.75 dlrs cash and
54.25 dlrs principal amount of AV Holdings junior subordinated
discount debentures.
    As a result of the merger, Borg-Warner will become a wholly
owned subsidiary of AV Holdings. A Borg-Warner spokeswoman said
members of management do not plan to participate in the
transaction, but they will retain their positions with the
company.
    A spokesman for GAF was unavailable for comment. GAF holds
19.9 pct of Borg-Warner's shares.
    GAF had said it would offer 46 dlrs per share.
    Borg-Warner's spokeswoman said the company still plans to
sell its financial services unit, which includes Wells Fargo
security guards, and the Chilton Corp, a credit rating service.
    Borg-Warner has been the focus of takeover speculation for
about a year. Corporate raider Irwin Jacobs last year proposed
a takeover of the firm and until recently held 10 pct of the
stock. Following the GAF offer, analysts had calculated breakup
values for the company in the low 50 dlrs per share range and
speculated an offer would have to be sweetened.
    In its statement, Borg-Warner said its board endorsed the
Merrill offer and it recommended that shareholders tender their
shares. The board received opinions on the offer from its
advisors, First Boston Corp and Goldman, Sachs and Co.
    James Burke, president of Merrill Lynch Capital Partners,
said, "We are very pleased to have entered into this transaction
with Borg-Warner. We are looking forward to working with the
employees of Borg-Warner and to Borg-Warner maintaining its
strong presence in the Chicago community."
    Merrill Lynch will be the dealer-manager for the offer,
which expires at midnight EDT May 8 (0400 GMT, May 9), subject
to conditions, including the completion of necessary financing
arrangements.
    The offer is also subject to a minimum 44.25 mln shares, or
51 pct of the outstanding shares, being tendered.
    Merrill Lynch and certain affiliates have committed to
provide 200 mln dlrs in AV Holdings equity and 870 mln in
subordinated financing and forward underwriting commitments.
    Merrill Lynch said that following discussions with
commercial banks it is confident it can obtain the rest of the
financing required to complete the transaction.
    The junior subordinated discount debentures to be issued in
the merger will carry a 13 pct coupon and will begin paying
cash interest after five years.
    The debentures will be redeemable at the company's option
for the first six years at 105 pct, during the seventh year at
102.5 pct and after that at 100 pct of the principal amount.
    The junior subordinated discount debentures have a maturity
of 20 years and are entitled to a sinking fund commencing in
the 16th year designed to retire 60 pct of the issue before
maturity.
    Borg-Warner will also redeem all of its outstanding 4.50
dlrs cumulative preferred stock, series A, for 100 dlrs per
share. Holders who wish to participate in the offer must first
convert their preferred stock into Borg-Warner common stock.
    The board of Borg-Warner has also taken steps to redeem its
poison pill or share purchase rights for five cents per right,
effective immediately.

Department of Trade and Industry figures show.
    The index for materials and fuel purchased by manufacturing
industry fell a provisional and unadjusted 1.1 pct after a 1.7
pct fall in February.
    The Department said the year-on-year rise in producer

provisional 4.2 pct increase in the year to end-February.
    The index for output prices, non-seasonally adjusted, was
put at a provisional 149.7 in March after 149.3 in February.
    The index for input prices, also not seasonally adjusted,
was set at 128.2 in March after February's 129.6.
    The 1.1 pct fall in input prices between February and March
was mainly due to a seasonal fall in industrial electricity
costs and lower scheduled prices for petroleum products, the
Department said.
    The Department said these falls were only partly offset by
a rise in prices of home-produced food manufacturing materials.
    The seasonally adjusted index for input prices showed a 0.2
pct rise between February and March.
    Year-on-year, the input price index was down 0.7 pct in
March after a 2.8 pct drop in February.

The ruling Liberal Democratic Party's
(LDP) setback in Sunday's nationwide local elections may force
the government to water down its controversial proposal for a
five pct sales tax and undermine its commitment to stimulating
the economy, private economists said.
    The LDP's failure to win seats in some crucial local
constituencies will weaken the government's ability to push
through its tax plan, and without a compromise tax proposal the
budget for fiscal 1987/88 ending March 31 is unlikely to be
passed soon, they said.
    Without the budget, the government would also be
hard-pressed to come up with an effective package to stimulate
the economy as pledged at Group of Seven meetings in Paris in
late February and in Washington last week, they said.
    Opposition protests against the sales tax have stalled
parliamentary debate on the budget for weeks and forced the
government to enact a stop-gap 1987/88 budget that began early
this month.
    "The LDP's election setback will have an enormous impact on
the already faltering economy," said Johsen Takahashi, chief
economist at Mitsubishi Research Institute.
    Takahashi said that behind the LDP's poor showing was
public discontent with the government's high-handed push for
tax reform and its lack of effective policies to cope with
economic woes caused by the yen's appreciation.
    "This explains why the LDP failed to regain governorships in
the most hotly contested constituencies of Fukuoka and
Hokkaido, where the shipbuilding and steel industries are
suffering heavily from the yen's extended rise," he said.
    Takahashi said the government should delay introduction of
the sales tax for one or two years beyond its original starting
date of January 1988 and implement tax cuts now.
    Sumitomo Bank Ltd chief economist Masahiko Koido also said
he favours watering down the proposed sales tax while
suggesting the government boost public works spending by
modifying its tight fiscal policies.
    "The local election results were a signal the economy now
needs government action to take clear-cut fiscal measures," he
said, adding that such moves would help the world economy as
well as Japan's.
    For the last five years or so, the government has stuck to
a tight fiscal policy in a bid to halt the issue of deficit
financing bonds by fiscal 1990/91, economists said.
    If the LDP election setback leads to a scaled down sales
tax proposal, the government would have to find other revenue
sources to help finance the planned tax cuts and a package of
measures to stimulate the economy, the economists said.
    Koido said the government could raise additional revenue by
selling shares in public corporations such as Nippon Telegraph
and Telephone Corp. But it should issue additional bonds to
ensure a more stable source of funds, he said.
    "It may run counter to its avowed policy of balancing the
budget, but it can do so on a short-term basis," he said.
    Takahashi of Mitsubishi Research also agreed with the need
for the government to float more bonds to raise funds needed
for economic expansion.
    He said additional government borrowing would place no
burden on the capital market because it has amassed huge excess
funds and government bond prices have risen to record levels
lately.
    "The market is just waiting for more new government bond
issues," he said.

The five leading West German economic
research institutes said the government should do more to
stimulate economic growth and called for early introduction of
tax cuts planned for 1990.
    In their joint spring report the institutes were divided
about 1987 growth forecasts, with three predicting two pct
expansion and the other two only one pct growth. Gross national
product grew 2.4 pct last year.
    But the report said all the institutes believed that "more
must be done to produce dynamic growth so that more additional
jobs can be created."
    The institutes said any step which improved basic economic
conditions should be taken as quickly as possible. "From this
point of view, the tax reform planned for 1990 should be
brought forward."
    The government plans gross tax reductions of 44 billion
marks as part of the major tax reform. The net tax relief from
the tax reform will amount to 25 billion marks.
    However, the institutes criticised the government, not only
for the timing of the reform, but also because the question of
its financing had been left open.
    The government has not specified how the remaining 19
billion marks of the tax reduction package will be paid for,
though it has said it wants to cut state subsidies.
    The institutes said this lack of clarity from Bonn had
caused uncertainty among companies and households as to what
exactly they would receive from the tax reform and urged a
quick decision from the government.
    They also said the government should reduce tax
preferences, which would simplify the fiscal system, urged a
restriction of state spending and called for no increase in
value-added tax.
    The institutes also criticised Bonn for increasing
subsidies at a time further reductions had been pledged.
    They referred specifically to a doubling of special
writedowns for small and medium sized companies announced in a
package of tax adjustments planned for 1988 and described this
as an increase in subsidies.
    The institutes said total subsidies, including tax
preferences, had reached 80 billion marks in 1985 and risen
further since then. Given the scope of these subsidies, it
should be possible "despite ... Major political difficulties" to
finance the tax reform by cutting state handouts.
    The institutes said that if the government raised value
added tax or other indirect taxes a large portion of the
positive effects resulting from lower taxes would be lost.
    The report also noted that the government was progressing
only slowly with its plans to privatise state companies and
said more deregulation was needed. The government had to aim
for more competition, it said.

A takeover battle began today for
debt-burdened Dome Petroleum Ltd <DMP.MO> as TransCanada
PipeLines Ltd <TRP.TO> announced a 4.3 billion dlr offer and
Dome said it is continuing talks with other possible buyers.
    Companies mentioned in market speculation as potential
buyers for Dome include Imperial Oil Ltd <IMO.A> which is 70
pct owned by Exxon Corp <XON.N>, <PanCanadian Petroleum Ltd>
which is 87 pct owned by the conglomerate Canadian Pacific Ltd
<CP.N> and British Petroleum Co Plc <BP.L>.
    Along with the TransCanada offer, Dome has had another
proposal from "a substantial company" and discussions with a
third company which could lead to an offer, Dome said in a
statement.
    The statement confirmed Dome received TransCanada's bid,
but did not identify the companies involved in talks.
    TransCanada, Canada's largest natural gas pipeline
operator, said it is offering Dome a package of cash, common
and preferred shares, and shares in a new subsidiary which
would own and operate Dome's assets. TransCanada said the offer
is to Dome management, not to shareholders.
    Dome has massive oil and gas landholdings in Canada,
totalling 36.1 mln acres of which 7.4 mln have been developed.
It also has tax credits worth about 2.5 billion dlrs.
    Dome's statement said the TransCanada announcement "violated
the terms and spirit of a confidentiality agreement entered
into with prospective purchasers" and was apparently timed to
prevent Dome from considering other proposals.
    It said the TransCanada bid "seems to require favourable and
substantial taxation concessions from the federal and
provincial governments." But Dome added that its management and
financial advisers will evaluate all proposals.
    TransCanada chief financial officer H. Neil Nichols said he
was surprised at the vehemence of Dome's statement and denied
that TransCanada was trying to usurp other bids. "I find (Dome's
statement) very bothersome. Once the board made the decision to
authorise the proposal, it had a legal obligation to announce
it," he said. Nichols said he did not know the identity of the
other bidders, or the terms of other offers.
    Dome common shares closed at 1.13 dlrs on Friday on the
Toronto Stock Exchange. The preferred class A stock closed at
5.00 dlrs. Common stock traded as high as 25.00 dlrs in 1981.

Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro
Nakasone's unpopular plan to introduce a sales tax caused an
electoral setback for his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)
in Sunday's local elections, political analysts said.
    The LDP retained its 11 prefectural governorships, but
failed to restore a governorship in Fukuoka it had placed much
importance on winning. In the prefectural assembly elections to
fill 2,670 seats, the LDP has so far lost 92 of its previously
held 1,487 seats to the socialists and communists.
    Full election results should be available later today.
    Discussing the election results with reporters, Nakasone
said, "I wouldn't say the proposed five pct sales tax had no
effect at all, but there were other factors, such as a low
turnout and unusually cold weather."
    The Home Affairs Ministry said the average turnout for the
13 gubernatorial elections was a record low 59.78 pct while the
prefectural assembly polls drew an average of 66.66 pct, also a
record low.
    Noboru Goto, president of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and
Industry and a longtime friend of Nakasone, told reporters the
impact of the sales tax on the LDP's setback was obvious.
    "The government should take action (on the sales tax) in
regard to the people's wishes," Goto said.
    Nakasone and other LDP leaders have already hinted at a
delay in the implementation of the tax, which had been
scheduled for next January, and a possible cut in the rate.
    "The most important thing now is to get parliamentary
approval of the budget as soon as possible to arrest a rapid
appreciation of the yen," Nakasone said. "We must implement
measures to prop up the economy."
    Opposition parties said the elections were a referendum on
the tax and they will continue to demand its retraction.

U.K. Producer price data for March were
roughly as expected after taking into account technical factors
which affected the year-on-year outcome, economic analysts
said.
    The figures showed a 0.3 pct provisional, non-seasonally
adjusted rise in output prices in March, unchanged from
February and close to the average for the last six months.
    The year-on-year rise was put at 3.7 pct, down from 4.2 pct
in February.
    But Chris Tinker, economist at brokerage house Phillips and
Drew, said the drop in the year-on-year rate mainly reflected a
rise in excise duties which affected the index in March last
year.
    He cautioned that it was dangerous to read too much into
the monthly figure, adding that a rise of only 0.2 pct in April
would take the year-on-year rise back above 4.2 pct.
    Analysts also noted that a drop in manufacturers' input
prices was almost entirely due to anticipated seasonal factors
such as a fall in industrial electricity costs.
    Duncan Squire of Lloyds Merchant Bank said the figures were
slightly disappointing in that the strengthening of sterling
had not yet reduced input prices as much as expected.
    Both he and Tinker said this factor should help keep input
costs down over the next few months, although Tinker added that
last year's fall in oil prices is now about to drop out of the
year-on-year comparisons and is likely to lead to a return to
rises in the index rather than falls.

West German Economics Minister Martin
Bangemann indirectly rejected a call from the country's leading
economic research institutes for early introduction of a major
tax reform involving gross tax cuts of 44 billion marks.
    In a statement reacting to the five institutes' joint
spring report, Bangemann said that as far as the call for
bringing forward the 1990 tax reform was concerned --
    "The government points out that the positive effects for
growth of its policy of consolidation (cutting the budget
deficit) must not be allowed to be endangered."
    Bangemann also recalled that the scope of tax cuts planned
for 1988 had already been increased.
    Three institutes predicted two pct economic growth in 1987,
with exports falling by 0.5 pct. The other two saw only one pct
growth and said exports would fall 2.5 pct.
    Bangemann said "The government, agreeing with the majority,
sees no reason for the extraordinarily pessimistic estimate for
exports expressed by the minority."
    He said there was reason to believe that export demand
would start to rise in the course of the year, partly because
of a further increase in world trade.

Tokyo share prices are expected to weaken
further for about a week, following a sharp drop which at one
time today saw the Nikkei Dow index down 571.01 points in
mid-afternoon trading, brokers said.
    They said uncertainty caused by disputes between Japan and
its main trading partners will continue to deter investors from
equities.
    The market index, which closed the day 297.05 points down
at 22,919.54, will probably end the present downturn at around
22,300 points, brokers predicted.
    "This is just a short-term correction and the market will
probably end up at about 22,300 in about a week's time," said a
broker at Nomura Securities Co.
    He said that today's late recovery from afternoon lows
showed that investors were still hunting bargains in
anticipation of an upturn.
    Brokers reiterated expectations of an imminent cut in
Japan's 2.5 pct discount rate, a factor seen to be diverting
money from bank accounts into stocks and boosting the market.
    Securities company, bank and insurance issues, likely to
benefit from a rate cut, were bought in late trading.
    The Nomura broker said he expects the rate cut in May or
June, after Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's scheduled visit
to Washington on April 29. Nakasone is expected to seek an end
to Japanese-U.S. Trade disputes which are hurting investor
confidence.
    "Until we see some concerted effort by the Japanese to halt
the yen's rise against the dollar and settle trade disputes,
the market will stay low," said head of equities at Jardine
Fleming Securities Co, Mario Malt.
    Malt said current talks between the countries were
inflammatory and damaged stockmarket optimism.
    Brokers also said that Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic
Party has to show it still rules, after Sunday's nationwide
local elections showed dwindling support.
    "It raises doubts on whether the LDP can push through the
reforms it planned for this year," said one broker.
    Top policy priorities this year are deregulation of
financial activities, stimulation of domestic demand to boost
imports and removal of agricultural subsidies.
    If these policies are abandoned or scaled down, stockmarket
investors will have few reasons to buy stocks, brokers said.

Two Utah financial institutions, the
Bank of Iron County and Summit Savings and Loan Association,
have failed, official spokesmen said.
    The board of directors of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (FDIC) has approved the assumption of the deposit
liabilities of Bank of Iron County, Parowan, Utah, by Dixie
State Bank, St George, Utah, an FDIC spokesman said.
    The bank, which had total assets of 20.1 mln dlrs, was the
first bank in Utah to fail this year and the 59th nationwide.
    Its three offices will reopen today as branches of Dixie
State Bank and its depositors will automatically become
depositors of the assuming bank.
    Dixie State Bank will assume about 19.9 mln dlrs in 6,300
deposit accounts and will purchase all of the failed bank's
assets at a discount of 3.575 mln dlrs.
    The Federal Home Loan Bank Board closed Summit Savings and
Loan Association, Park City, Utah, and directed the Federal
Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC) to transfer an
estimated 116.9 mln dlrs in insured deposits to United Savings
and Loan Association, Ogden, Utah, an FSLIC spokesman said.
    Summit, a 120.8 mln dlr institution, was insolvent, the
spokesman said. The bank board appointed the FSLIC as
conservator for the association on April 14, 1986.
    Summit has since operated as part of the bank board's
Management Consignment Program. United Savings has 205 mln dlrs
in assets and nine offices in Utah, and one in Idaho.

The five leading West German economic
research institutes, which have revised down their forecasts
for 1987 growth, do not predict a recession in West Germany,
their spokesman, Hans-Juergen Schmahl said.
    The institutes were divided in their spring report on
forecasts for 1987, with three predicting two pct growth and
two seeing only one pct expansion. Growth was 2.4 pct in 1986.
    Schmahl, presenting the report at a news conference, said,
"None of the institutes reckons with a recession or with the
beginning of a recession." He added, however, that exports
remained the weak point of the economy .
    Schmahl also said West Germany would have to expect further
encroachments of foreign goods onto its markets.

DIW of West Berlin had presented the more pessimistic view of
the economy, said, "The braking effects (on the economy)
produced by external factors will remain considerable for most
of the year."

Former Guinness Plc <GUIN.L> chairman
Ernest Saunders dismissed allegations he ordered the shredding

"completely untrue," the Press Association news agency reported.
The allegations were made by his former personal assistant
Margaret McGrath, in a statement to the High Court on Friday.

the fourth day of a hearing, on an application by Saunders and
U.S. Lawyer Thomas Ward for the discharge of "asset-freezing"
orders obtained by Guinness on March 18.
    McGrath alleged that among the documents destroyed were
papers from the files on the <Distillers Co Plc> bid, as well
as diaries, correspondence and an address book.
    The temporary orders froze property owned by the two men
valued about 5.2 mln stg, the sum paid by Guinness into a
Jersey bank last May during the Distillers takeover.

the whereabouts of the money and hand it back to Guinness

dlrs. On Monday, its five branches in Oregon will open as
branches of Williamsburg, which has 287 mln dlrs in assets and
19 offices in Oregon, Washington state and Utah.
    The Bank Board said it closed Future because the
association was insolvent.
    The Board said Future lost money on commercial real estate
loans which were poorly underwritten and inadequately
appraised. Future also violated regulations on the amount of
money which could be loaned to one individual, the Board said.
    Accounts of up to 100,000 dlrs at Future are insured by the
Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp (FSLIC). Depositors
with accounts of over 100,000 dlrs will share Future's assets
on a pro rata basis after the assets have been liquidated.

at a price of 42 dlrs 0.01 preferred share for each common
share held.  The rights will expire April Nine.
    The company said the rights would be exercisable 20

Crazy Eddie common stock or announce a tender or exchange offer
that would result in ownership of 30 pct or more.
    Crazy Eddie said if a party owning 20 pct or more of its
stock were to merge into it or if a party were to acquire 40
pct or more of Crazy Eddie stock, right holders other than the
acquiring party would be entitled to acquire common shares or
other securities or assets with a market value equal to twice
the rights' exercise price.
    If after a party acquired 20 pct or more of its stock Crazy
Eddie were acquired or 50 pct of its earnings power or assets
sold, rightholders other than the acquirer would be entitled to
buy shares of the acquirer's common stock worth twice the
rights' exercise price, the company said.
    Crazy Eddie said if a party were to acquire 30 pct or more
of its common stock and then fail to acquire Crazy Eddie within
180 days thereafter, rightholders would be entitled to exchange
their Crazy Eddie common stock for subordinated notes of Crazy
Eddie maturing either one year or, above a certain dollar limt,
five years after issuance.
    Crazy Eddie said adoption of the plan is not in response to

Senate Finance Committee Chairman
Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.) called on major industrial countries to
make a pledge at the coming economic summit in Venice to cut
interest rates.
    "I think at the summit meeting in Venice what we ought to be
trying to do is to get the other major industrial nations that
are involved to bring interest rates down, say, one pct,"
Bentsen told NBC Television's "Meet the Press."
    Bentsen said coordinated rate cuts could take "billions off
the debt service of the Latin countries" and help ease
protectionist pressures in the industrial countries.
    Bentsen also South Korea and Taiwan should be pressured to
revalue their currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar.
    "You take the Taiwanese, with an enormous capital surplus,
enormous trade surplus, and we've had very little cooperation
there," he said.
    Departing Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman told the
same television network he agreed that the U.S. dollar had not
fallen enough against the currencies of some countries.
    "I think that more does have to be done there in
negotiations with the countries involved, the so-called NICs
(newly industrialized countries)," he said.
    Darman said such negotiations with newly industrialized
countries were underway privately.
    Bentsen predicted Congress and the White House would agree
on a fiscal 1988 budget that would raise between 18 and 22
billion dlrs in new revenues.
    The Texas senator said a series of excise taxes would be
considered by Congress, including an extension of the telephone
tax and new levies on liquor and cigarettes.
    Bentsen said he supported an oil import fee, but that it
would not happen without President Reagan's support.
    Darman called for a "top level negotiation" between the White
House and Congress on a budget compromise that would include
asset sales, some excise taxes, cuts in middle-class
entitlement programs, "a reasonable, steady rate of growth in
defense" and reform of the budget process.

Investor Martin T. Sosnoff said he has
raised his offer for Caesars World Inc shares to 32 dlrs each
from 28 dlrs and has reduced the number of shares he is seeking
to 29.1 mln from all those not already owned.
    In a newspaper advertisement, Sosnoff said the bid by his
MTS Acquisition Corp, withdrawal rights and the proration
period will now expire June 19 unless extended. The offer had
been scheduled to expire May 15. In late March, Sosnoff said he
had received a "negligible" number of shares in response to the
offer, which had been rejected by Caesars as inadequate.
    Sosnoff already owns about four mln of Caesars' 30 mln
common shares now outstanding, or a 13.3 pct interest on a
primary basis.
    Last week, Caesars' board approved a recapitalization plan
as an alternative to the Sosnoff offer under which shareholders
would receive a special dividend of 25 dlrs per share, subject
to approval by shareholders at a special meeting to be held in
June.
    The company planned to borrow 200 mln dlrs and sell 800 mln
dlrs in debt to finance the payout.
    Sosnoff said in the newspaper advertisement that the
amended offer is conditioned on receipt of enough shares to
give him a majority interest on a fully diluted basis and on
the arrangement of financing, as well as to approvals by New
Jersey and Nevada gaming authorities.
    He said the tender would be the first step in acquiring all
of Caesars' shares and if successful would be followed by a
merger transaction.
    Sosnoff said later in a statement that the 29.1 mln shares
he is now seeking, together with the 4,217,675 shares he owns,
would give him a 92.4 pct interest on a fully diluted basis.
    He said he still has received only a "negligible" number of
shares in response to his tender.
    In a letter to Caesars' chairman Henry Gluck included in
the statement, Sosnoff said Gluck had again refused, on April
8, to meet with him, even though he had said he was willing to
increase the price of his offer.
    Sosnoff said the financing for the offer is almost fully in
place.
    Sosnoff said PaineWebber Group Inc <PWJ> has now delivered
to him commitments to purchase up to 475 mln dlrs of increasing
dividend cumulative exchangeable preferred stock of MTS Holding
Corp, an indirect parent corporation of MTS Acquisition.
    He said Marine Midland Banks Inc <MM>, which leads a
syndicate that has provided commitments for a 500 mln dlr
margin facility, believes it will be able to arrange for
further commitments under the margin facility to advance up to
an additional 25 mln dlrs that may be needed to permit the
purchase of shares under the offer.
    Sosnoff said under the merger that would follow his tender,
each of the 2,750,000 Caesars shares not covered by the offer,
or 7.6 pct on a fully diluted basis, would be converted into
Series A preferred stock valued at 32 dlrs per shareby an
independent investment baking firm.
    He said "To the extent that fewer than 29,100,000 sdhares
are purchased in the offer, the stockholders would receive a
combination of cash and Series A preferred stock having a value
of 32 dlrs per share of Caesars."
    Sosnoff said he believes terms of his offer are superior to
Caesars' recapitalization.
    Sosnoff said he will be meeting this week with gaming
officials in Nevada in an effort to expedite the investigatory
process required for regulatory approval, a process that it
already underway in New Jersey.
    He said his offer has been extended based on the likely
duration of the regulatory process.
    He said he intends to further extend the offer if the
approval process is not completed by the expiration date.

Columbia Gas Transmission
corp said it made an abbreviated, streamlined filing with the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to recover a portion if
its costs of renegotiating high-cost gas purchase contracts.
    Recently, the Columbia Gas System Inc pipeline subsidiary
said, FERC denied on procedural grounds and without prejudice a
proposal to include these costs in the company's most recent
purchased gas adjustment -- or PGA -- filing.
    Noting it has has asked for a rehearing on the denial
ruling, Columbia Gas said it would withdraw its alternative
filing if the commission grantes its request for a rehearing to
include the contract renegotiation costs in its PGA or
consolidates this issue in the pipeline's general rate filing
and permit recovery, subject to refund, effective April one.
    The company said the alternative filing seeks to recover
about 79 mln dlrs a year through the pipeline's non-gas sales
commodity rates. This annual amortization amount is based on
recovery of about 653 mln drls over an 8-1/4 year period,
beginning April 1, 1987.
    Columbia Gas said the filing would increase the pipeline
commodity rates by 15.74 cts per mln Btu to 2.95 dlrs per mln.
    The company said it orginially sought to include these
costs in its PGA since the payments to products resulted in
almost five billion dlrs in prospective price relief and were
not related to take-or-pay buyout costs.
    It explained this interpretation was based on FERC's April
10, 1985, Statement of Policy which said that only take-or-pay
buyout costs must be recovered through a general rate filing
under the Natural Gas Act.
    As a result of renegotiating contracts for high-cost gas,
Columbia Gas said, it has been able to reduce the average price
paid for gas purchased from Southwest producers to 1.96 dlrs
per mln Btu in December 1986 from 3.64 dlrs per mln in April
1985.
    The pipeline said Southwestern producers account for 46 pct
of its total available gas supply this year.

Texaco Inc.'s plunge into bankruptcy to
shield it from posting a bond in its 10.53 billion dlr legal
battle with Pennzoil Co. <PZL> is a strategy that will give it
breathing room until the fight over the 1984 acquisition of
Getty Oil Co. winds its way up to the U.S. Supreme Court,
analysts said.
    Texaco, the nation's third-largest oil company, filed for
protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. bankruptcy code earlier
today, saying it had no choice because of Pennzoil's refusal to
negotiate a reasonable settlement.
    But unlike most Chapter 11 cases, the Texaco proceeding
should not result in a major reorganization of the company or
affect its daily business operations, several experts said.
    "This is another piece of financial history," Sanford
Margoshes, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers, said of
the bankruptcy filing. "What Texaco is doing is buying time to
fight its battle in the courts. They have high hopes they will
be upheld if the case goes all the way to the U.S. Supreme
Court."
    Margoshes said he did not anticipate any significant
changes in Texaco's oil exploration and production business
because the bankruptcy filing affects only about four pct of
the giant oil company's 32.6 billion dlrs in annual revenues.
    Texaco executives said the bankruptcy filing would
effectively halt payments of stock dividends and repayment of
its 6.8 billion dlr debt, but added that the company's assets
far exceeded its liabilities.
    "Texaco's cash flow is at a very respectable rate of about
15 dlrs per share annually," Margoshes said. "Obviously, the
point of Chapter 11 was not so much seeking protection from
creditors as it was seeking protection from the predator
Pennzoil."
    The two companies have been locked in an acrimonious
struggle since a Texas state court jury in November 1985
ordered Texaco to pay Pennzoil 10.53 billion dlrs for
improperly interfering with Pennzoil's planned acquisition of
Getty Oil Co. In a major setback for Texaco last week, the U.S.
Supreme Court said Texaco must abide by Texas state law that
requires posting a bond for the full amount of the judgment
while the merits of the case were appealed.
    Although a Texas appeals court hearing was scheduled Monday
(April 13) on Texaco's motion to reduce the amount of the bond
required under state law, Texaco elected not to risk losing the
important court ruling that could have required it to post more
than 10 billion dlrs in collateral.
    The bankruptcy filing, analysts said, effectively freezes
all of Texaco's obligations while it continues to appeal the
merits of the Pennzoil lawsuit.
    "This is a drastic measure," said Rosario Ilacqua, an
analyst with L.F. Rothschild in New York. "But it's also an
indictment of the legal system in this country in that Texaco
was forced to seek bankruptcy when it couldn't get a fair
hearing."
    Ilacqua predicted that the Texas jury judgment would
ultimately be overturned or whittled down from its original
10.53 billion dlrs, an amount that is increasing by about 2.5
mln dlrs in interest accumulated daily. Texaco has contested
the ruling, insisting that Pennzoil did not have a valid
contract under New York state law to acquire Getty Oil.
    Suggestions by some experts that the Texaco bankruptcy
might be an incentive for Pennzoil to lower its settlement
demands, which are widely believed to be between 3 billion and
5 billion dlrs, were discounted by indignant Pennzoil
executives.
    "I think it makes it much more difficult to settle," said
Baine Kerr, Pennzoil's retired president who has acted as the
company's chief negotiator in the Texaco litigation. "I think
that's one of the main reasons they did it."
    Joseph Jamail, a Houston lawyer for Pennzoil, said the
company had made its latest settlement offer to Texaco on
Saturday and was taken by surprise when Texaco filed for
bankruptcy. He declined to reveal the amount of the proposal,
citing a confidentiality agreement between the two companies.
    "Texaco told us they would get back to us but instead they
chose to go to bankruptcy court," Jamail said. "This was an
irresponsible and unneeded move."
    Ilacqua also said the bankruptcy filing appeared to
eliminate any chance of settlement in the near-term.
    "There have been some crazy numbers floating around in
settlement discussions," Ilacqua said. "I think 1 billion dlr
settlement would be more than adequate for Pennzoil. I don't
know if that Texas jury really understood what money is. They
gave Pennzoil an astronomical judgment."
    Analysts said they expected Texaco stock, which closed
Friday at 31 and 7/8, to slip to about 25 when the New York
Stock Exchange opened Monday morning.
    Lawyers for Pennzoil said they believed the company would
prevail in court appeals, adding that Texaco's assets were
ample enough to ultimately pay the Pennzoil judgment in full.

Four of West Germany's five leading
economic research institutes warned that excessive monetary
growth threatened a resurgence of inflation.
    But in a dissenting view the DIW institute in West Berlin,
echoing recent statements by leading Bundesbank officials, said
the expansion seen over the last 1-1/2 years did not
necessarily threaten stability.
    The five institutes issued a joint spring report, in which
three -- Kiel, Hamburg and Essen -- forecast a two pct rise in
GNP in 1987, while West Berlin and Munich predicted one pct.
    The four institutes said an expansive policy was welcome in
view of the slowdown in economic activity. But experience has
shown that strong monetary growth eventually leads to a price
rise which undoes the beneficial effects of monetary policy.
    Given virtual zero inflation in West Germany such fears may
seem exaggerated, they said.
    "But it has often turned out in the past that the price
climate can quickly deteriorate, forcing the central bank into
a restrictive policy," they said.
    The economic costs of a preventive stability policy are
less than fighting inflation once it has taken hold, they said.
    The four institutes disputed the view that monetary
expansion would slow of its own accord in 1987 as domestic
investors switch liquidity into longer term capital market
investments following lower interest rates.
    "Such redispositions may temporarily dampen the expansion of
central bank money stock, but do not automatically lead to a
smaller expansion of money supply," they said.
    A return to growth and stability did not require
spectacular central bank moves, but could be done quietly with
open market operations and repurchase pacts, which would avoid
an interest rate rise by dampening inflationary expectations.
    The DIW institute said monetary policy should not be
focused simply on growth of production potential. Because of
uncertainty about exchange rate developments and economic
weakness other factors should be taken into account.
    Monetary policy should aim for further interest rate cuts
and avoid rises to boost the economy and discourage revaluation
speculation. Recent strong monetary expansion was not a threat
in itself to price stability.
    The 1979/81 inflation following strong 1977/78 money growth
reflected other causes, such as rising oil prices and the
falling mark.

Coopervision Inc said it is
preparing a recapitalization plan, which includes a common
stock repurchase program and an exchange of debt securities for
common stock.
    The plan, along with a proposal to change its name to
Cooper Cos Inc, will be submitted for shareholders' approval at
the company's annual meeting on June 22.
    The meeting had been postponed from its original date of
May 14 in order to let management review recapitalization
options, it said.
    In addition, Coopervision said operating income in its
current fiscal quarter ending April 30 is expected to show an
improvement over its prior fiscal quarter's 82.5 mln dlrs and
its year ago quarter.
    Income from continuing operations was not immediately
availalbe for the prior year's second quarter in which it
reported a net loss of 14.9 mln dlrs.
    At a Drexel Burnham Lambert Investor Conference,
Coopervision chairman Parker Montgomery said, as previously
announced, he will listen to any bid that makes sense for
shareholders.
    He also said Coopervision's stock fell in 1986 due to its
second quarter loss, rumors of a liquidation at 30 dlrs and 35
dlrs a share, and Ivan Boesky's subsequent sale of his
position.
    "The stock dropped six dlrs in three days after Boesky sold
his position and has never recovered," Montgomery said. The
company's stock is currently trading at 19-1/4.
    Montgomery further told the conference, "Don't be an
investor in the stock on the basis of any short term recovery
in operating or net income in 1987 and 1988."
    "Our concentration is on maintaining or increasing market
share in our core businesses this year and next, regardless of
the impact to the bottom line," he said.

Pentland Industries PLC said it report
a substantial capital gain from the sale of part of its
holdings in Reebok International Limited, which will cut its
stake in Reebok to 32.2 pct from 36.7 pct.
     It said Reebok filed a registration statement with the
Securities and Exchange Commission for the offering of six mln
shares of Reebok common. Reebok will sell three mln shares and
Pentland will sell 1,404,866 shares, reducing its stake in
Reebok to 18.1 mln from 19.5 mln shares.
    After the offering, Reebok will have 56.1 mln shares shares
outstanding.
    Pentland said the amount of the capital gain from the sale
depends on the offering price for the Reebok shares to be
negotiated between it, Reebok, and the other selling
stockholders who will offer about 1.6 mln shares of Reebok
common, and the underwriters.
    Pentland said proceeds from the offering will be used by
Reebok to retire bank debt incurred in its acquisition of AVIA
Group for about 180 mln dlrs. Is said that afterwards, Reebok
will have bank credit lines available for general corporate
purposes, including possible acquisitions.
    Reebok's stock was selling at 45-1/2, up 1/8. At that
price, the 1.4 mln Reebok shares Pentland will sell are worth
about 64 mln dlrs and the three mln shares Reebok will sell are
worth about 136.5 mln dlrs.
    Pentland said it will use proceeds to fund growth and
possible acquisitions.
    Pentland said 4,500,000 shares of Rebbok will be offered in
the U.S. by a syndicate led by Kidder, Peabody and Co Inc and
1,500,000 shares will be offered outside the U.S. by an

to buy from certain selling stockholders up to an additional

    Joske's has 26 stores in Texas and one in Arizona.
Cain-Sloan has four stores in Nashville. Joske's is the largest

    Robert Campeau, chairman of Allied, said "this is a
terrific start to our disposition program which is proceeding
well ahead of schedule. This sale will fulfill the requirements

give us additional flexibility in the disposal of the remaining
divisions being sold."
     Allied Stores is required to pay 200 mln dlrs in bank debt
by June 30. There had been some doubts on Wall Street that the
company could meet the payment.
    A Campeau source said, "We believe this cash sale puts us
in a very strong negotiating position to maximize the proceeds
Allied can receive from its other divisions."
    "Allied was able to put itself in a position where it knows
it will be able to meet the June 30 payment schedules," the

    About 1.1 bilion dlrs in Allied assets had been targeted
for sale by Dec. 31, 1988 to pay for the aquisition of Allied

    "Our optimism is based on our incoming order rates and the
strength of our product lines," the company said.
    NCR Corp plans additional new product announcements this
year, it said without elaborating.
    NCR earlier said first quarter profit increased to 61.5 mln

prior year. NCR's 1986 full-year earnings rose to 336.5 mln

    NCR said the increase in first quarter profit resulted from
strong revenue growth, which was particularly strong in Europe

First quarter revenues increased to 1.12 billion dlrs from

Moody's Investors Service Inc said it
may downgrade 950 mln dlrs of debt of Irving Bank Corp and lead
bank Irving Trust Co.
    The rating agency said it will assess Irving's ability to
substantially improve operating results in increasingly
competitive markets. The review will also focus on Irving's
shifting risk profile in light of its modest capital base.
    Moody's cited the bank's significant exposure to less
developed countries. Under review are the parent's Aa-3 senior
debt, A-1 subordinated debt and Aa-3 preferred stock and Irving
Trust's Aa-1 long-term desposits and letters of credit.

Texaco Inc's decision to file for
protection under the bankruptcy code had a chilling effect on
its stock, and sent Pennzoil Co's shares sharply lower as well,
traders said.
    Texaco dropped 3-1/2 to 28-3/8 and Pennzoil fell 12-7/8 to
79-3/8.
    "A lot of people had bid up Pennzoil, expecting a
settlement of two to five billion dlrs in this case," energy
analyst Rosario Ilacqua of L.F. Rothschild said, "and now
nobody knows where this is going to settle out."
    "It seems to me that the hope of an out of court settlement
in this long running court case had a greater relative impact
on Pennzoil's stock then on Texaco's," analyst Sanford
Margoshes of Shearson Lehman Brothers said, citing the sharper
decline in Pennzoil this morning.
    The litigation arose when Pennzoil sued Texaco for
interfering in its 1984 agreement to acquire Getty Oil. In
1985, a Texas state court ruled in favor of Pennzoil and
ordered Texaco to pay 10.53 billion dlrs in damages.
    Citing the burden of the court case and a Supreme Court
ruling last week in favor of Pennzoil concerning the amount
Texaco must put up as a bond while appealing the case, Texaco
filed for the Chapter 11 protection on Sunday.
    "That decision puts Pennzoil in the unsecured creditor
catagory and that means they have lost their preferred
position, which is causing the most damage to the stock today,"
Margoshes said. "They will only be able to collect payment
after secured creditors have collected," he said.
    "From the standpoint of the attractiveness of Texaco's
stock," Margoshes said, "I have turned quite bullish."
    "I think there is an overreaction in the downside of the
(Texaco) stock today, with some investors believing that Texaco
cannot effectively conduct its business. But only Texaco Inc
and two subsidiaries are under protection, and there is no
indication that they will not be able to proceed adequately,"
Margoshes said. In addition, he noted, "there are insitutions
that just cannot legally--according to their own
regulations--hold a stock that is in bankruptcy. That caused
much of the selling at the opening," he said.
    L.F. Rothschild's Ilacqua said "you have to wonder if an
interim settlement can be reached between the two or if this
thing is going to go the full legal route, and that is what
investment decisions hinge on."
    He said "if this whole thing settles with Texaco owing a
lot less than the 10 billion dlrs, speculating in Texaco stock
could be quite interesting." He expects the stock to trade 25
dlr to 30 dlr a share range for as long as it takes for a
decision to made in the case.

Foster Wheeler Corp <FWC> said an
audit of its Stearns Airport Equiment Co Inc unit, revealed
"substantial discrepancies" in Stearns accounts that may
require material adjustments to previously announce
consolidated results of the company and its subsidiaries.
    Foster said certain Stearn officers and senior management
made Stearn's operations appear more profitable than they were
by improperly recording job costs. It said Stearn's president
and controller had resigned. A Foster spokesman said he did not
know the names of the president and controller, and could not
immediately comment on the release.
    Foster said the amount involved in the "discrepancy" is
about 13.7 mln dlrs before taxes or about 8.2 mln dlrs net
after tax due to an "improper recording of job costs over a
period of several years and continuing through part of the
first quarter of 1987."
    Stearns is a unit of Foster's Conergic Corp subsidiary.
The company said the impact on its results for 1987 was not
"likely to be significant" but the amount to be charged to
prior periods had not been determined.
    Foster reported after tax earnings of 28 mln dlrs, 26 mln
dlrs and 35.4 mln dlrs for 1986, 1985, and 1984, respectively.
    Stearns, based in Crowley, Texas, makes airport baggage
conveyor equipment and passenger loading bridges.
    Foster, a diversified international concern with 27
subsidiaries operating worldwide, is based in Livingston, New
Jersey. Its reported revenues for the period ended December 26,
1986 of 1.3 billion dlrs.
    The company said a detailed audit and investigation is
continuing. A company spokesman declined to comment further on
the investigation.

Despite a sharp early fall in Texaco
Inc bonds, the 125 billion dlr U.S. junk bond market was
largely unaffected by Texaco's weekend filing for protection
under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, analysts said.
    "Texaco's filing had little, if any, effect on junk bond
prices this morning. It should not spill over to the overall
market like LTV Corp's <LTV> bankruptcy filing did last
summer," said one analyst.
    Traders said some Texaco debt issues fell over 30 points
this morning in thin trading, but recouped about half that.
    "Because of the Texaco filing, some investors bid down its
paper to the mid-60 area (around 650 dlrs per 1,000 dlr face
value) from around 95 Friday," said a dealer in high-yield, low
rated bonds.
    "But sellers could not be found at those levels and the
bids soon rebounded to the 75 to 85 area," he added, referring
to such issues as Texaco's 13 pct notes of 1991, the 13-1/4s of
1999 and 13-5/8s of 1994. All were in the mid-90s Friday.
    The rebound occurred after Standard and Poor's Corp
downgraded the debt ratings of 8.4 billion dlrs of debt of
Texaco and its subsidiaries to D, traders noted.
    S and P cited the weekend bankruptcy filing. The agency
said it uses the D grade for securities issued by companies in
Chapter 11 reorganization.
    Moody's Investors Service Inc followed suit, cutting most
of the debt of Texaco and its units to Caa.
    The junk bond market experienced a short-lived downturn
last summer when LTV's bankruptcy filing sparked worries that
credit conditions of other steel companies would also worsen.
    "This is clearly not the case with Texaco," said one
trader. Because of their high yields, junk bonds have lately
outperformed investment grade corporates, he and others said.
    Analysts and portfolio managers said they viewed Texaco's
bankruptcy filing as a defensive move.
    Indeed, a Texas State Court of Appeal this morning said the
bankruptcy petition effectively stays Texaco's obligation under
Texas law to post a bond in its 10.53 billion dlr litigation
against Pennzoil Co <PZL>.
    "The filing was not the result of credit weakness. The
company got through the oil crisis alright," said one portfolio
manager.
    Others who run junk bond portfolios agreed with that
assessment and said they would still buy high-yield issues.

Borrowing on the international capital
markets contracted significantly in March with 23.1 billion
dlrs of medium and long-term funds raised, down 3.4 billion
from February and about nine billion dlrs less than in March
1986, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development
said in its latest monthly report.
    Borrowing on external bond markets totalled 19.7 billion
dlrs, some 1.1 billion below the February figure.
    The market for floating rate notes saw further setbacks and
the volume of new offerings fell to only 800 mln dlrs from 1.4
billion in February.
    For the first quarter as a whole, the OECD said, funds
raised on the floating rate bond market totalled three billion
dlrs, the lowest figure since the third quarter of 1982.
    Activity on the straight bond market was also less buoyant
than in previous months while equity-related offerings
continued to benefit from the good performance of major stock
markets.
    Exchange rate uncertainties continued to have a major
impact on the currency composition of new bonds. Dollar issues
totalled 6.8 billion dlrs, accounting for only 35 pct of total
offerings, but borrowing was particularly heavy on the euroyen
market (3.3 billion dlrs) and in sterling (2.8 billion dlrs).
    Offerings of mark bonds declined to 1.3 billion dlrs from
around three billion dlrs in the two previous months, whilst
strong advances were recorded in the euro-Australian and
euro-Canadian dollar sectors, where new offerings exceeded one
billion dlrs, the OECD said.
    In the syndicated credit market, the volume of new loans
fell to 2.4 billion dlrs in March from 4.2 billion in February.
Similarly, activity on the market for note issuance and other
back-up facilities fell to one billion dlrs from 1.5 billion.
    In March, OECD borrowers accounted for over 90 pct of total
borrowing. Japan was the largest fund-raiser with 4.5 billion
dlrs, followed by the U.S. With 3.9 billion and Britain with
2.4 billion dlrs.
    France, West Germany and Norway raised funds of over one
billion dlrs each.
    Borrowing by developing countries totalled one billion
dlrs, about the same amount as in February. But borrowing by
east European countries fell to 300 mln dlrs from 600 mln in
February, the OECD added.

Chemical New York Corp said its
first-quarter profits fell by 16 pct, largely because it placed
1.04 billion dlrs of loans to Brazil on non-accrual.
    Chemical reported first-quarter net income of 86.2 mln
dlrs, down from 102.6 mln a year earlier, but declaring the
Brazilian loans non-performing cost Chemical 21 mln dlrs in
lost interest income, or 12 mln dlrs after-tax.
    A 13.3 pct jump in non-interest expense to 471.3 mln dlrs
from 415.9 mln also hit the bottom line. It said the rise was
mainly due to staff costs associated with continued growth in
consumer, capital markets and investment banking activities.
    Excluding the effect of placing Brazil on non-accrual,
Chemical said its net income would have been 98.2 mln dlrs, or
4.3 pct below 1986 earnings.
    Brazil suspended interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of
medium- and long-term debt on February 20. If they are not
resumed by year's end, Chemical said its after-tax net for the
whole of 1987 will be reduced by about 51 mln dlrs.
    Chemical also placed 52 mln dlrs of loans to Ecuador on
non-accrual because the Quito government also suspended
interest payments on its foreign debt. This reduced interest
income by 1.5 mln dlrs.
    Chemical said net interest income fell to 476.4 mln dlrs
from 488.9 mln and its net spread narrowed to 3.61 pct from
3.96 pct.
    This reflected the reclassification of Brazilian loans, a
reduced federal income tax rate (which affected the calculation
of the taxabale-equivalent adjustment on tax-exempt assets) and
a narrowing of the spread between the prime rate and Chemical's
cost of funds.
    Foreign exchange trading profits rose to 37.9 mln dlrs from
27.0 mln, but bond trading profits dropped to 21.9 mln dlrs
from 26.2 mln.
    Fees from trust and other banking services rose to 146.5
mln dlrs from 129.3 mln a year earlier, Chemical said.
    The provision for loan losses was 87.2 mln dlrs, compared
with 83.8 mln. Net loan charge-offs were 86.5 mln, up from 60.7
mln, leaving the allowance for loan losses at 672.6 mln dlrs at
quarter's end, or 1.74 pct of loans outstanding, compared with
594.3 mln, or 1.50 pct, a year earlier.
    Non-accruing loans at the end of March were 2.39 billion
dlrs (1.35 billion excluding Brazil), compared with 1.35
billion at the end of 1986 and 1.22 billion at the end of
March, 1986.

Primary dealers in U.K. Government gilts
will not be required to underwrite the government's offering of
its securities when the first auctions begin in Mid-May, the
Bank of England said.
    In an official notice released today, the Bank said "There
will be no formal or informal underwriting arrangement for the
auctions but the Bank encourages all gilt-edged market makers,
as part of their commitment to the market, to participate
actively in the auction process."
    The Bank was originally believed to have favoured requiring
the dealers to underwrite auctions, which are patterned after
those in the U.S. Treasury market.
    However, the Treasury was believed to have baulked at the
request by the 27 market makers for an allotment commission
which would discourage the largest institutional investors from
placing orders for new stock directly through the Bank of
England, thus denying primary dealers some of their best
customers. Commission would have been passed along to customers
who did place orders via the primary dealers, making it less
expensive to buy through them than to go directly to the Bank.
    Market sources said the Bank had, in its discussions with
the dealers about the upcoming auctions, agreed that the
allotment commission was reasonable if the dealers had a
concurrent commitment to buy at the auction regardless of
market conditions.
    Indeed, the Bank and the gilts dealers are believed to be
disappointed that the Treasury has not agreed to go along with
the plan. However, in its paper, the Bank suggested that any
conditions applied for the first few auctions may be abandoned
or modified in future sales of gilts if they prove inefficient
or unwieldy.
    Among other items in the document, the Bank said its first
auction will consist of up to 1.25 billion stg in conventional
short-dated stock and have a maturity of seven years or less.
    Subsequent auctions to be held in the 1987-88 financial
year would first be of up to one billion stg of long-dated
stock having a maturity of 15 years or longer and then of up to
one billion stg of medium dated stock of seven to 15 years in
maturity.
    The remainder of the gilt-edged funding program would be
met by traditional tap offerings of stock via the government
broker.
    To protect the buyers of the newly auctioned stock, the
Bank has agreed to establish a so-called fallow period, a
28-day period during which it agrees not to issue any new stock
of the same type, and it will not necessarily resume selling
the stock once the fallow period expires.
    In the event that prices offered for the stock to be sold
are substantially out of line with market conditions, the Bank
will agree to take the stock onto its own books.
    The bank would then be free to sell the stock during the
fallow period but not at a price below the minimum tender
price.
    The Bank also said that at least initially, auctions will
be alloted on a bid price basis, a system under which bidders
are allotted stock at the price which they bid.
    However, the Bank said it reserves the right to limit any
money market maker from buying more than 25 pct of a single
auction. The Bank is widely believed to be concerned about
preventing a single market maker from cornering a stock to
drive the price up.
   The Bank has repeatedly signalled its intention to prevent
dealers from cornering the market in a stock, issuing
additional stock, on occasion, to end a market shortage.
    The Bank has also agreed to publish information about the
auction results as soon as possible after the sale is complete,
which is widely expected to be on the same day.
    Information to be released will include the amount of stock
allotted in terms of both competitive and non-competitive bids,
and the highest, lowest and average price of the successful
bids.

National Westminster Bank USA said
higher loans and core deposit volumes as well as a substantial
increase in net interest income contributed to a 16 pct rise in
first-quarter earnings to 17.7 mln dlrs from 15.3 mln reported
a year earlier.
    The earnings gain came despite a 1.5 mln dlr reduction of
income as a result of placing Brazilian loans on non-accrual.
    Net interest income totalled 92.5 mln dlrs compared with
91.7 mln dlrs in the same 1986 period as loans, mostly to
middle market businesses, increased by 896 mln dlrs. But some
of these gains were offset by low levels of interest rates.
    Provision for loan losses rose to 13.8 mln dlrs from 13.0
mln a year earlier. At March 31, the allowance for loan losses
was 114.2 mln dlrs versus 94.8 mln at end of March 1986.
    Non-accrual loans rose to 286 mln dlrs from 132 mln at the
end of the first quarter of 1986, largely because 119 mln dlrs
of loans to Brazil were put on non-accrual status.
    The bank said that if these loans remain on non-accrual for
the remainder of the year net income for 1987 would be reduced
by about 4.9 mln dlrs.
    National Westminster Bank USA is a wholly-owned subsidiary
of National Westminster Bank PLC.

International Business Machines Corp
has started the year aggressively, but industry analysts said
the company still faces some tough rounds in its fight to stop
a two-year earnings slump.
    "I am more impressed with what's happening at IBM than I
have been in a long time," said PaineWebber analyst Stephen
Smith.
    "But they're not out of the woods yet," he added.
    At 1.30 dlrs a share, IBM's first-quarter net income easily
topped most estimates on Wall Street, which had ranged from an
even dollar to 1.20 dlrs.
    Most analysts said they were pleasantly surprised by IBM's
performance. But they indicated that IBM's chances for a full
recovery hinged on several key factors whose impact will not be
felt until later in the year.
    These include the success of IBM's new personal computer
line, introduced two weeks ago, and its 9370 minicomputers,
which will begin volume shipments in July.
    In addition, IBM has said the full benefits of its
early-retirement program and other cost-cutting moves will
emerge as the year progresses.
    Analysts noted that IBM chairman John F. Akers was
relatively more upbeat in assessing the company's outlook than
he has been for nearly a year.
    "Although the worldwide economic situation remains
unsettled, there are some encouraging signs in our business,"
Akers said, pointing to, among other things, higher
first-quarter shipments. "We remain optimistic about the
prospects for both the industry and IBM," he said.
    "Akers was most encouraging," said PaineWebber's Smith.
    A weak dollar, a lower tax rate and strong mainframe
computer sales all contributed to the better-than-expected
first-quarter results, analysts said.
    "Shipments of the 3090 mainframes were very strong in
March," after a weak January and February, said Ulric Weil of
Washington-based Weil and Associates.
    Sales of the top-of-the-line mainframes, commonly called
the Sierras, "bailed out the whole quarter," Weil said, adding,
"If this continues, it augers well for the rest of the year."

Irving Bank Corp said a six pct drop
in first-quarter net income from a year earlier was largely the
result of placing medium- and long-term loans to borrowers in
Brazil and Ecuador on non-accrual status.
    Income in the first three months fell to 28.60 mln dlrs
from 30.43 mln in the same 1986 period. Earnings per share
dropped to 1.51 dlrs from 1.62.
    Irving put 215 mln dlrs of Brazilian and 33 mln dlrs of
Ecuadorean loans on non-accrual, reducing first-quarter net
income by a total of 4.4 mln dlrs after tax.
    Irving estimates full year net would be reduced by 15.3 mln
dlrs after tax if no cash interest payments are received on
these loans during the remainder of 1987.
    Also adversely affecting earnings were losses on the
trading of securities and higher non-interest expenses,
although these were partly offset by increased trust income,
profits from foreign exchange trading and investment securities
gains, the bank said.
    The allowance for loan losses was 224.8 mln dlrs, up from
185.2 mln a year earlier. The provision for loan losses was
21.8 mln versus 19.5 mln in the first quarter of 1986.

    Following consummation of the offer, a unit of MacAndrews

challenging acquisition of the shares by MacAnrews.
    The companies said the tender offer and withdrawal rights

    MacAndrews said it will promptly file revised tender offer
material with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc is acting as dealer-manager for the offer,

    Revlon currently has about 42 mln shares outstanding. The
current offer price is about 782 mln dlrs, a company spokesman
said, up from the previous offer of 720 mln dlrs.
    On April 1, MacAndrews and Forbes, owned by Ronald

shares he did not already own.
    Since the offer was made over a dozen shareholder lawsuits

The Bank of England will step up
reporting requirements for primary dealers in U.K. Government
gilts during the when-issued trading period in between the date
an auction is announced and the date the sale is actually held.
    In its document on the auctions, the Bank said "The Bank is
content for such (when-issued) trading to cevelop subject to
certain conditions, in particular for predential supervision of
the credit risk to which the gilt-edged market makers and
Inter-dealer brokers may become exposed."
    The Bank is widely expected to require dealers to report
wehn-issued trading positions on a daily basis.
    When-issued trading presents certain unusual risks because
dealers are buying and selling a security that technically does
not exist although there is no uncertainty about when it will
be issued.
    Still, the fact there is no physical delivery possible
presents certain credit risks as well.
    The Bank is widely expected to expand its reporting
requiremenmts for unsettled trades, requiring firms to report
unsettled when-issued trades one day after they occur.
Normally, unsettled trades must be reported three days after
they occur.

    Gobert characterized the market action in Dome as "awfully

    TransCanada PipeLines' offer is to Dome management, not to

GTE Corp said the decline in its

50 pct share ownership of U.S. Sprint's operations.
    This loss is an increase from the 60 mln dlrs loss reported
on operations GTE owned a year ago quarter and prior to
entering a joint venture with United Telecommunications <UT> in
July 1986. Under the joint venture, each company owns 50 pct of
Sprint.
    Earlier, the company reported net income declined to 265.0
mln dlrs from 283.0 mln dlrs in the first quarter a year ago.
    Theodore Brophy, chairman of GTE said, "we expect US
Sprint's losses to diminish later this year as customer traffic
migrates to the new fiber-optic network for long distance
telecommunications.
    The reason for the higher losses reflect lower prices as
well as higher operating costs related, in part, to the
fraudalent use of the network.

Goodyear expects to report a profit of more than one dlr a

    Mercer said about seven companies are interested in buying

    Celeron consists of oil and gas reserves and an almost
complete pipeline linking drilling operations in Santa Barbara,
Calif., to Texas refineries. Mercer said Celeron's reserves

Celeron was too high, Mercer said "There is no fire sale going

operation throughout the year."

Aristech Chemical Corp chairman and

estimates of its 1987 fiscal year earnings of 2.25 dlrs to 2.50
dlrs per share are about right.
    Addressing a gathering of analysts and institutional

share.
    He also said the first quarter estimates were 70 pct higher
than 1986's first quarter net of 29 cts per share.
Marshall attributibuted the first quarter earnings growth to
several factors, including sustained demand in Aristech's major
domestic markets and continued growth in exports.

The dollar straight sector of the
eurobond market ended lower after another nervous day's
trading, with many operators keeping to the sidelines ahead of
tomorrow's U.S. Trade figures for February, dealers said.
Prices of longer dated issues ended 1/2 or 5/8 point lower,
while short dates were 1/8 to 3/8 point easier.
    Bonds for Texaco Inc units hardly traded during the day
following the weekend news that the company filed for Chapter
11 bankruptcy protection in another twist to its long running
dispute with Pennzoil Co, dealers added.
    The Chapter 11 filing means that Texaco will not be paying
interest on its eurobonds. Dealers in the straight bonds noted
that the market in them had been basis only for some time prior
to the weekend's news. "It wasn't a true market, someone asked
you a price and you just gave them an idea," one said.
    However, the company's convertible bonds had been trading
since the company's share price provided a benchmark to which
dealers could establish a proper price level. The company has
two actively traded convertibles outstanding, a 500 mln dlr
bond due 1994 which pays 11-3/4 pct and a one billion dlr deal,
also due 1994, paying 11-7/8 pct.
    Traders even disagreed about last week's closing levels for
the convertible bonds, but a median appeared to be around 97 to
99 pct. Today, one trader said they were indicated initially at
65 to 70 pct before ending at some 79 83 pct.
    But he added, "That's only an idea. There's no real market
today. I've dealt once during the day, I'm not going to say at
what level." Other dealers were reluctant even to give an
indication of the bonds' levels.
    Dealers said the market in all Texaco deals will almost
certainly remain on an indicated, or negotiated, basis until
the events of the weekend are further clarified.
    The primary market had a steady day, with the Australian
dollar and the yen sectors again seeing the most activity,
dealers said. Deutsche Bank Finance NV Curacao became the first
of three issuers in the Australian dollar market during the
morning with a 100 mln dlr bond due 1990 paying 14-1/8 pct and
priced at 100-1/4 pct.
    The issue was lead managed by Deutsche Bank Capital Markets
(DBCM) and guaranteed by Deutsche Bank itself. A DBCM official
said the firm had placed 60 mln Australian dlrs of the issue
itself and quoted the deal at less one less 7/8 pct,
comfortably inside the 1-1/2 pct total fees.
    The State Bank of Victoria issued a 50 mln Australian dlr
bond paying 14-1/2 pct over three years and priced at 101-3/8
pct. Commerzbank AG was sole manager for the deal, which was
offered on one broker screen at less 1-1/2 pct.
    The day's other borrower in this sector was the New South
Wales Treasury Corporation guaranteed by the crown-in-right of
New South Wales. The five year bond pays 14-1/4 pct and was
priced at 101-7/8 pct.
    Lead manager was County Natwest Capital Markets. It was
quoted at less 1-7/8 less 1-3/4 pct, inside the two pct total
fees.
    Secondary market Australian dlr bonds ended little changed
on the day, with dealers saying that operators are awaiting the
Australian trade figures for March. A deficit of some 800 mln
to one billion dlrs was expected by one house active in the
sector.
    Union Bank of Switzerland (Securities) Ltd lead managed a
15 billion yen bond for Union Bank of Switzerland NV. The five
year deal pays 4-3/8 pct and features a put and call option at
par after four years.
    Priced at 101-5/8 pct, the issue was quoted at less 1-1/4
pct bid on the grey market compared with the total fees of
1-5/8 pct.
    Ente Nazionale per l'Energia Elettrica issued a 15 billion
yen bond due 1994 at 4-3/4 pct and priced at 101-7/8 pct. The
deal was quoted on the 1-7/8 pct total fees.
    Elsewhere, Alza Corp issued a 75 mln dlr convertible bond
due 2002 through Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. The par priced
issue has an indicated coupon of between 5-1/2 and 5-3/4 pct.

GAF Corp, set on acquiring Borg-Warner
Corp's valuable plastics business, is believed by analysts to
be preparing an increased offer for the Chicago-based company.
     Yesterday, Borg-Warner said it agreed to be acquired for
4.23 billion dlrs by a company to be formed by Merrill Lynch
Capital Partners. Merrill offered 48.50 dlrs cash per share for
89 pct of Borg-Warner's common stock, and a package of cash and
securities for the balance.
    Borg-Warner stock rose 1-3/8 to 49-5/8.
    "I think it's (the stock price) telling us GAF is coming in
with another bid," said one analyst, who values the company at
51 or 52 dlrs per share.
    GAF has offered 46 dlrs per share. It holds 19.9 pct of
Borg-Warner's stock.
    "You're in a cat and mouse game on how you're going to up
the price. Obviously, nobody wants to pay more than you have
to. I think GAF is looking at the company the way we're looking
at it - that it's worth more," Pershing and Co analyst Richard
Henderson said.
    Henderson estimated it is worth abouth 55 dlrs per share.
    GAF has only said it was reviewing the situation. Merrill
Lynch officials did not return phone calls.
    Analysts have said they believe GAF Chairman Samuel Heyman
sought Borg-Warner because of its chemicals and plastics
business. The rigid plastics are used in such things as
telephones, computer terminals, and appliances.
    "Where the heck can you buy a world class chemical
operation these days," said Henderson.
    "He's (Heyman's) got the bucks. He's a heavy hitter, and he
does not like to get pushed around," said Henderson.
    GAF, a roofing and chemicals concern, attempted a takeover
of the much larger Union Carbide Corp two years ago. While GAF
did not win the company, it made a substantial gain on its
investment in Carbide.
    Analysts said GAF already has a large profit built into its
Borg-Warner holdings. They said even if GAF raises its offer
and does not succeed, a higher bid from another company would
give GAF millions of dollars in profits on its stock.
    "It's a win-win situation," said one analyst.
    One analyst speculated an offer from GAF would be
forthcoming shortly.
    "I think we are finally down to the final paragraph in this
book," he said.
    Borg-Warner's other businesses include automotive parts,
protective services, which includes Wells Fargo security
guards, and Chilton Corp, a credit rating service.
    Charles Rose, an Oppenheimer and Co analyst who follows
GAF, said if GAF were to sell into the Merrill Lynch offer, it
would realize about 125 mln dlrs net profit, or about 3.50 per
share.
    "I think there's a probability he goes up in price," said
Rose.
    Rose said, however, he could not really predict what Heyman
would do. "Sam's a low-risk, high-return player."
    "Is he trying to build a major industrial chemical
enterprise, or is he trying to be an investment bank," Rose
said.
    Analysts said Borg-Warner's chemical business would add
earnings momentum to GAF. "I worked out that paying as much as
50 dlrs per share would still be additive to GAF in time, if
they sold off most of the non-chemical facilities," said John
Henry of E.F. Hutton.
    Borg-Warner's chemical and plastics business provided 1986
operating profits of 153.3 mln dlrs on revenues of 1.04 billion
dlrs. Total operating profits were 349.7 mln dlrs, and net
earnings were 206.3 mln dlrs for 1986.
    "The Borg chemical business is great," said Rose, adding
its only U.S. competitors are Monsanto Co <MCT> and Dow
Chemical Co <DOW>.

World Bank President Barber Conable
said he opposed forgiving developing countries' debt because
the proposal, if adopted, would lead to a cutoff in lending to
the indebted countries.
    "I think (debt) forgiveness will simply create an
environment in which no more money will go into development and
a lot of the world will be consigned to poverty and to
instability indefinitely," he told ABC Television on Sunday.
    A number of bills have been introduced in Congress that
would require commercial banks to forgive a least a portion of
the debt owed them by cash-starved developing countries.
    "I think we've got to find ways of encouraging continuous
improvement in policies, of wise use of money in short, rather
than trying to turn everybody off," Conable said.
    Conable told ABC's "Business World" he supported Treasury
Secretary James Baker's debt plan as an "andidote to debt."
    Baker has said the best way to reduce the developing
countries' debt burden is to boost their growth rates through
reformed domestic policies and increased commercial bank
lending.

The ruling Liberal Democratic Party's
(LDP) setback in Sunday's nationwide local elections may force
the government to water down its controversial proposal for a
five pct sales tax and undermine its commitment to stimulating
the economy, private economists said.
    The LDP's failure to win seats in some crucial local
constituencies will weaken the government's ability to push
through its tax plan, and without a compromise tax proposal the
budget for fiscal 1987/88 ending March 31 is unlikely to be
passed soon, they said.
    Without the budget, the government would also be
hard-pressed to come up with an effective package to stimulate
the economy as pledged at Group of Seven meetings in Paris in
late February and in Washington last week, they said.
    Opposition protests against the sales tax have stalled
parliamentary debate on the budget for weeks and forced the
government to enact a stop-gap 1987/88 budget that began early
this month.
    "The LDP's election setback will have an enormous impact on
the already faltering economy," said Johsen Takahashi, chief
economist at Mitsubishi Research Institute.
    Takahashi said that behind the LDP's poor showing was
public discontent with the government's high-handed push for
tax reform and its lack of effective policies to cope with
economic woes caused by the yen's appreciation.
    "This explains why the LDP failed to regain governorships in
the most hotly contested constituencies of Fukuoka and
Hokkaido, where the shipbuilding and steel industries are
suffering heavily from the yen's extended rise," he said.
    Takahashi said the government should delay introduction of
the sales tax for one or two years beyond its original starting
date of January 1988 and implement tax cuts now.

U.S. officials said they held out
little hope the European Community, EC, would withdraw a
controversial meat inspection requirement, due to go into
effect April 30 and which U.S. meat producers claim will cut
off their exports.
    But the officials said they expect the EC to allow U.S.
plants to continue shipping meat through the end of the year
provided they submit a plant improvement program with the U.S.
Agriculture Department.
    The EC's so-called Third Country Meat Directive will
require foreign meat processing plants to comply fully with EC
inspection standards beginning April 30.
    The U.S. meat industry has prepared a petition requesting
the Reagan administration to retaliate against the EC rule.
    At issue are U.S. meat exports to the EC valued at 132 mln
dlrs in 1985.
    The EC rule would require all U.S. plants to make changes
in their inspection methods, ranging from veterinary staffing
to use of wood.
    Last December, the EC determined that only one U.S. cattle,
one hog and one sheep slaughtering facility could be approved
without further review. USDA would have to certify that the
plants had corrected the deficiencies.
    All remaining plants with a history or potential of
shipping to the EC -- totaling nearly 400 -- would require more
significant changes in plant constructions or procedures before
further EC review.
    Robert Hibbert, general counsel for the American Meat
Institute, said the meat industry expected to submit a formal
trade retaliation petition by April 30.
    An interagency committee is reviewing the industry's draft
petition.
    An official at the U.S. Trade Representative's Office said
U.S. officials continued to press the EC to withdraw the rule,
but that "the chances of that are not too good at this time."
    However, there is the "expectation" in U.S. government and
meat industry circles that the EC will continue to allow
shipments, at least through the end of the calendar year, from
U.S. plants that submit to USDA a plan on how they will bring
their operations into conformity with the EC regulation, the
USTR official said.

Major U.S. banks may lift prime
lending rates again within days due to recent increases in
their borrowing costs and speculation the Federal Reserve is
nudging up interest rates to help the dollar, economists said.
    In what was the first prime rate boost since mid-1984, most
banks in early April lifted their rates a quarter point to
7-3/4 pct, citing a reduced gap between the prime and their own
cost of money. That spread has narrowed again.
    "A prime rate increase could happen as soon as tonight,"
said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International Inc.
    Brusca said a quarter-point prime rate rise to eight pct is
justified because the spread between banks' cost of funds and
the prime rate has narrowed to less than three quarters of a
percentage point.
    He said that spread had averaged around 1.4 percentage
points since last October until it fell below one point and
triggered the April prime rate rise at most banks.
    "We could easily have another prime rate increase as soon
as this week," said David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston and Co.
    "We've got a fairly good chance of a prime rate rise in the
near future," said Allan Leslie of Discount Corp.
    "Based on the spread between the prime rate and funding
costs, you would ordinarily see a prime rate increase now,"
said Harold Nathan, economist at Wells Fargo Bank.
    However, he said banks may be reluctant to lift the prime
because that would dampen already fairly weak business loan
demand and because some are not sure the Fed will maintain
recent upward pressure on money market interest rates.
    Nathan believes the Fed has let market pressures lift
short-term rates in recent days to help the ailing dollar. He
said "if there is widespread belief money market rates will
stay high, a prime rate rise could occur at any time."
    Fed officials have long expressed concern that too steep a
dollar drop could help rekindle U.S. inflation. As the dollar
fell to a 40-year low against the yen Friday, currency traders
said the Fed and other central banks supported the dollar.
    In addition to buying dollars outright, another way to
stabilize the U.S. currency would be for the Fed to push U.S.
interest rates higher relative to overseas rates.
    Based particularly on the Fed's reserve management actions
on Friday and today, Nathan of Wells Fargo said "it has become
clear that the Fed is not fully resisting upward rate pressure
in the market. It is supplying fewer reserves than are needed."
    Bank funding costs and other short and long-term interest
rates rose sharply Friday and today on heightened speculation
that the Fed is gently firming monetary policy.
    That was because the Fed supplied far fewer reserves in the
market than most economists had expected.
    On Friday, the Fed added reserves indirectly and in small
amounts via one billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements
with the Federal funds rate at which banks lend to one another
high at 6-5/16 pct. With funds trading even higher at 6-1/2 pct
today, the Fed arranged only a slightly larger 1.5 billion dlr
round of customer repurchase agreements.
    "The Fed's actions on Friday and today show that it is
offering only token resistance to upward funds rate pressures,"
said Jones of Lanston.
    "The Fed is focusing its policy attention mainly on the
need to defend the dollar," Jones said. He believes it is
merely shading policy toward restraint now, "but to have a
major impact on the dollar, the Fed will have to tighten policy
overtly at some point."
    Jones expects the Fed to foster higher market rates by
becoming more restrictive in supplying reserves and, within
four to six weeks, to raise its discount rate from 5-1/2 pct.
    Jones said a U.S. discount rate increase to six pct might
well be accompanied by West German and Japanese rate cuts to
further aid the dollar.
    Given likely Fed policy firming, he said both the yield on
30-year Treasury bonds (about 8.30 pct now) and the prime rate
may be at 8-1/2 pct at end-June and nine pct by year's end.
    "The jury is still out on whether the Fed is tightening
policy to defend the dollar," said Leslie of Discount Corp. He
said tax-date pressures have been pushing up Fed funds lately.
Leslie said Fed actions and reserve data once these pressures
abate will show whether or not it is firming policy.

    Asked by reporters if Dome should remain in Canadian hands,
Blair replied, "Yes. I think that we still need to be building
as much Canadian position in this industry as we can and I
think it would be best if Dome ends up in the hands of Canadian
management."

FMC Corp's 225 mln dlr insider trading
case against Wall Street arbitrageur Ivan Boesky was dismissed
by a federal court, a court clerk said.
    Federal Judge Ann C. Williams, in an oral ruling, said FMC
had not been harmed by trading in FMC stock by Boesky and other
traders prior to FMC's two-billion dlr recapitalization last
year.
    FMC had claimed insider trading by Boesky had forced it to
increase the value of the recapitalization to 80 dlrs a share
from 70 dlrs a share.
    FMC had charged that Boesky received confidential
information about FMC's planned recapitalization from Dennis
Levine, a former merger specialist with Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc.
    An FMC spokeswoman said in response to an inquiry that FMC
might appeal the ruling, made in the U.S. District Court for
the Northern District of Illinois, once a formal written
decision is received. The written ruling is expected April 15.
    The spokeswoman said FMC might appeal alleged contract
violations involved in the dispute. That part of the case,
involving a contract between FMC and Goldman Sachs and Co,
would be appealed to an Illinois state court, she said.
    Goldman Sachs was FMC's investment banker in its planned
restructuring. A FMC spokeswoman said the contract was a
standard contract under which Goldman Sachs advised FMC on the
restructuring.
    "We are certainly taking a look at appealing" the ruling in
Illinois state court, the FMC spokeswoman said in response to
an inquiry.
    The suit claimed that Boesky bought 95,300 FMC shares
between February 18 and February 21, 1986, selling those shares
for a profit of 975,000 dlrs on February 21, the day FMC first
said it was considering a recapitalization.
    Also, the suit said Boesky bought a further 1,922,000 FMC
shares between March 12 and April four, acknowledging the
purchase of a 7.5 pct stake in the company in a 13-D filing
with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April seven.
    "We alleged his actions kept the stock price artificially
high and put pressure on FMC to increase the terms of the
recapitalization," the FMC spokeswoman said.
    The increase to 80 dlrs from 70 dlrs a share was announced
April 26.

Honeywell Inc said a gain of
20.1 pct in its 1987 first quarter operating earnings was the
result of cost cutting efforts which began last year.
    Honeywell reported 1987 first quarter operating earnings
rose to 43.7 mln dlrs or 96 cts a share from 36.4 mln dlrs or
79 cts in the same period a year ago.
    Better operating results in each of the company's three 
sectors offset higher interest costs in the first quarter due
to financing the December acquisition of Sperry Aerospace and
the sharing of the Federal Systems subsidiary pre-tax profit
with Honeywell Bull Inc, Honeywell said.
    "Our first quarter results show clear benefits of our
restructuring," chairman Edson Spencer said. "All of our
businesses are producing better results than last year, even
though we do not see significant improvement in the external
market environment," he said.
    Total orders in the first quarter were up substantially,
with a sharp increase in aerospace and defense orders in
addition to those of the new Sperry Aerospace group, it said.
    Domestic industrial automation and control orders were
modestly higher than the same period in 1986, it said.
    Orders in Honeywell's home and building automation and
control business were flat in the U.S. and up in international
markets, it said.
    International orders increased, with the greatest strength
in Europe, Honeywell said.
    The company said that by year-end 1987, it intends to
complete the repurchase of 3.3 mln shares remaining of a five
mln share buyback program which began in 1986.

Spencer Cos Inc said it sued two Chase

to seek protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code.
    The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the
District of Massachusetts, seeks 100 mln dlrs in actual
damages, 300 mln dlrs in additional damages and recovery of
attorney's fees. In the nine-count complaint, Spencer contends
that Chase Manhattan Bank, while purporting to negotiate
additional financing, inflated Spencer's accounts, dishonored
its checks and seized 600,000 dlrs from its accounts without
notification.
    The company said Chase then demanded immediate repayment of
its 3.2 mln dlrs unsecured loan.
    The suit also names Chase National Corporate Services Inc
as a defendant.
    The damages sought include a loss of about 40 mln dlrs on
the liquidation of Spencer's Happy Legs Inc subsidiary, the
footwear retailer said.
    Spencer said it has recovered more than 500,000 dlrs of the
funds seized by Chase and has obtained financing from a leading
Boston bank.

American Century Corp said it
has restated its earnings for the fiscal year ended June 30,
1986 to provide an additional five mln dlrs to its loan loss
allowance, causing a restated year-end net loss of 14,937,000
dlrs, instead of 9,937,000 dlrs.
    The company said the change came after talks with the
Securities and Exchange Commission on the company's judgement
in considering the five mln dlrs collectible.
    In the note to its 1986 financial statement, American
Century said it considered the five mln dlrs collectible,
making its loan loss provision less than required.
    The company said in spite of the SEC decision, it still
feels its allowance for possible loan losses at June 30, 1986
was adequate and that it has considered all relevant
information to determine the collectibility of the five mln dlr
receivable.

billion dlr offer for Borg-Warner Corp, and it has asked for
all information that was supplied to Merrill Lynch.
    A GAF spokesman said the company asked for the information
in order to enable GAF to fully evaluate its alternatives.
    The spokesman also confirmed that GAF did raise its bid to
48 dlrs cash from 46 dlrs per share on Friday.
    Merrill is offering 48.50 dlrs per share cash for 89 pct of
Borg-Warner, and a package of cash and securities for the
balance.
    The transaction with Merrill Lynch will take Borg-Warner
private in the form of a leveraged buyout. Merrill Lynch does
not intend to sell Borg-Warner assets, but it may be forced to
do so in financing the deal, said sources familiar with the
transaction.
     Borg-Warner has said its management is not a participant
in the transaction, but managers will retain their positions.
    The investors involved with Merrill include pension funds,
insurance companies and other institutional investors, sources
said.
    Analysts believe GAF, which owns 19.9 pct of Borg-Warner,
will raise its offer.
    That speculation drove Borg-warner stock up 1-3/8 to 49-5/8
in heavy trading. GAF closed at 49-5/8, off 3/4.

Texaco Inc told securities analysts at
a meeting today that any settlement offers to Pennzoil Co <PZL>
would now be far less than what it offered before, according to
analysts who attended the meeting.
    "The message was they were far less likely to settle
following the bankruptcy filing," said Richard Pzena of Sanford
C. Bernstein and Co, who attended the meeting.
    Texaco yesterday filed Chapter 11 bankrupcty to protect
itself from the 10.3 billion dlr judgement awarded to Pennzoil
for Texaco's illegal takeover of Getty Oil Co.
    Texaco spokesmen said they could not comment on the
analysts meeting.
    The company's bankruptcy filing freed Texaco from posting a
bond for the judgment pending appeal of the case in Texas
Courts. Pennzoil said it would oppose the Chapter 11 filing.
    "They are ready and willing to talk settlement," said one
analyst who attended the Texaco meeting but declined to be
named. "But a settlement would be for less now," he added.
    The analysts, a number of whom said they were recommending
Texaco, said the stock was so cheap that it might open up the
company up to a takeover bid. Texaco declined 3-1/8 to close at
28-1/2 today.
    Pzena said company officials were asked at the meeting if
it would agree to a takeover, but offered "no comment" in
reply. He said the company said that takeover talks were not
being held.
    "It would make a lot of sense for Royal Dutch/Shell <RD> or
Exxon Corp <XON> to go out and do it," Pzena said. "But they
wouldn't make a hostile offer."
    "This thing has opened them up to a possible acquisition,"
said Alan Edgar of Prudential Bache Capital Funding in Dallas.
"There's a lot of volume (in their stock) and that tells me
someone's messing around," he added.
    Texaco was the most actively traded issue on the New York
Stock Exchange with just under 13 mln shares changing hands.
    "I wouldn't rule anything out right now," said John Olson,
an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
    Pennzoil's stock, also on the NYSE's most active list, fell
15-1/4 points to close at 77. Many analysts said the bankruptcy
filing was unfavorable to Pennzoil.

U.S. oil traders said Texaco Inc's
filing for protection under the Chapter 11 bankruptcy code is
adding uncertainty to an already skittish oil market, but
opinions are divided on the impact to the market.
    "The filing is holding up wet barrel trading today," said
one trader. "Everyone is talking about it, assessing their
company's situations in relation to Texaco," he added.
     Some traders said companies that deal with Texaco are
concerned about whether they will receive payment or supplies
under the bankruptcy filing.
    However, others were less worried. "The first paid will be
the trading community and those connected with Texaco in the
shipping industry," one New York trader said.
    "If Texaco doesn't get crude supplies it can't run its
refineries, so its other assets would not be worth anything,"
he added.
    Texaco filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S.
bankruptcy code yesterday after failing to reach a settlement
with Pennzoil on an 11 billion dlrs court award for illegally
interferring with Pennzoil's proposed purchase of Getty Oil Co.

    "There is some reluctance to trade with Texaco but no great
change," said another trader, adding that traders are tending
toward prudence in their dealings with the company.
    Traders are assessing whether to require cash prepayment or
letters of credit, or to continue to trade as usual with Texaco
on an open line basis, he said.
    Another trader, however, described today's activity as
business as usual, adding that traders feel more secure because
no liens can be put on Texaco's assets while it is in
bankruptcy.
    Traders said there was no apparent effect of the Texaco
filing on crude futures trading although they said the exchange
might lower Texaco's position limit and require higher margins
for Texaco's trades.
    New York Mercantile Exchange President Rosemary McFadden
declined to comment on Texaco's futures trading, saying that is
is proprietary information. McFadden did say, however, that as
a matter of procedure, it is possible the exchange can lower

Merrill Lynch and Co Inc <MER>
subsidiary seeking to take over of Borg-Warner Corp said it
could realize a 30 mln dlr fee for its efforts, whether or not
the deal, which it values at 4.7 billion dlrs, succeeds.
    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Merrill Lynch Capital Partners Inc said it would receive a 30
mln dlr fee from the surviving company for acting as dealer
manager of the merger after the Borg-Warner deal is completed.
    But it said it could also receive a break-up fee of 30 mln
dlrs if the deal fails for reasons, which include another party
holding more than 40 pct of its stock or tendering for 50 pct.
    The 30 mln dlr fee is among the highest set down in any
tender offer agreement, either in compensation for dealer
manager services or for break-up of the deal.
    Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, backed by a group of
investors it organized, has launched a 48.50 dlr a share tender
offer for Borg-Warner for 90 pct of its stock.
    The company's board has approved the plan, which was
intended to thwart an unsolicited offer from GAF Corp.
    Borg-Warner also agreed to redeem all outstanding Series A
preferred shares and to pay off on all options at a 48.50 dlr a
share exercise price before the merger is effective, it said.
    Merrill Lynch said its representatives discussed a possible
leveraged buyout with Borg-Warner as early as last December.
    At that time, Merrill Lynch told the company it would
consider a 43 dlr a share tender offer in cash and securities,
if the Borg-Warner board approved, it said. On Feb 24, it said
it was told the company had decided against a buyout.
    But talks were revived after GAF launched its 46 dlr a
share proposal on March 31, Merrill Lynch said.
    Unlike its earlier proposal, Merrill Lynch said Borg-Warner
management was asked not to take part in the new deal and it
was conditioned upon payment of the fees.
    In addition to its fees, Merrill Lynch said it will also
get up to 17 mln dlrs from Borg-Warner to cover its expenses in
the tender offer.
    Merrill Lynch said it would continue operating Borg-Warner
as a subsidiary with its current officers keeping their
positions.
    But for flexibility purposes, Merrill Lynch said it is
considering redistributing Borg-Warner's assets to a number of
subsdiaries of an entity it created to carry out the merger.
    All in all Merrill Lynch estimated that there would be 130
mln dlrs in fees and expenses connected with the deal.
    Another 250 mln dlrs will be needed to repay certain debt
of Borg-Warner, Merrill Lynch said.
    To finance the deal, Merrill Lynch said it expects to
borrow 3.5 billion dlrs from a group of banks and sell 100 mln
dlrs of common stock of the new company, sell 100 mln dlrs of
non-voting preferred stock of the new company to Merrill Lynch
and Co, sell up to 650 mln dlrs of subordinated notes to
Merrill Lynch and Co and sell to the public 204 mln dlrs of
subordinated discount debentures.
    GAF has raised its offer to 48 dlrs a share cash.

Pennzoil Co, frustrated by Texaco Inc's
<TX> decision to seek bankruptcy protection from its 10.3
billion dlr court judgment, is preparing to launch a new
assault that may include investigating assets Texaco
transferred from its corporate parent to subsidiaries, legal
experts said.
    Joe Jamail, a Houston lawyer for Pennzoil, said the company
would file a challenge to Texaco's bankruptcy petition sometime
this week accusing the oil giant of bad faith and ignoring its
fiduciary responsibilities to shareholders.
    The action is almost certain to ignite a new round of
debate between the two companies stemming from Texaco's 1984
acquisition of Getty Oil Co for 10.2 billion dlrs, a company
Pennzoil believed it had an agreement to buy.
    "We're going to be doing a lot of things they may not
like," Jamail said, referring to the bankruptcy court
proceeding in New York.
    Some legal experts suggested that a mud-slinging battle in
bankruptcy court between the two companies might also provoke
Congressional interest in whether the bankruptcy code is too
lenient because it permits a profitable firm to freeze debts.
    Texaco, which has assets totaling 34.9 billion dlrs, sought
protection Sunday under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy
code rather than risk having a Texas appeals court order the
company to post a security bond for the entire amount of the
Pennzoil judgment.
    Gerald Treece, dean of the South Texas College of Law and
an observer of the litigation during the past three years, said
Pennzoil was unlikely to prove Texaco is not qualified to be in
bankruptcy court simply because the giant oil company has a
positive cash flow and assets that far exceed its liabilities.
    But Pennzoil may be successful in raising the issue of
whether Texaco improperly transferred certain assets from the
corporate parent into subsidiaries unaffected by the bankruptcy
filing, Treece said.
    "Pennzoil's lawyers are going to be like dogs barking at
the heels of Texaco wherever they go," Treece said, "I think
people are going to be surprised at the level of intensity that
Pennzoil will use in searching for hidden Texaco assets."
    Jamail said Pennzoil objected to Texaco's transfer of an
oil refinery and chemical plant in Port Arthur, Texas from its
corporate parent to a subsidiary on Dec. 9, 1985, one day
before a state court judge entered the record jury award
against Texaco. Jamail suggested that the refinery and chemical
plant, valued at about 1.1 billion dlrs, were deliberately
placed out of reach of the Texas jury judgment.
    But Richard Lieb, an attorney with Kronish, Lieb, Weiner
and Hellman in New York, said Texaco could elect to place
additional subsidiaries into bankruptcy if necessary.
    In the petition filed Sunday, only Texaco Inc, the
corporate parent, and two financial subsidiaries were included
in the bankruptcy case. The businesses account for only about
four pct of Texaco's total revenues.
    Mickey Sheinfeld, a Houston lawyer who represented
Continental Airlines in an historic bankruptcy case that set
aside labor union agreements, said the track record of the
bitter Texaco-Pennzoil struggle indicates that the two
companies could spend two or three years fighting in bankruptcy
court.
    "The courts have been very interested in the issue of
good-faith bankruptcy filings. This may prove to be a landmark
case in developing that issue," Sheinfeld said.
    Texaco, he said, was following the example set by Manville
Corp, A.H. Robins Co and other firms that fell into bankruptcy
expressly to avoid paying large legal judgments. Bankruptcy
laws were relaxed in 1978 so that a company no longer needed to
prove it was insolvent in order to seek protection from
creditors.
    Texaco lawyers bristle at the suggestion that the company
entered bankruptcy to spite Pennzoil.
    Gibson Gayle, a Texaco lawyer, said the company had every
right to seek protection from creditors, and that Texaco had
embarked on an internal restructuring plan in December 1984
that required transferring various assets among subsidiaries.
But Treece said the high profile of the Texaco bankruptcy case
may also put the company under an uncomfortable spotlight.
    "What seems fair and what may be legally correct may be two
entirely different things," Treece said. "This may be a signal
to Congress to do something about tightening the bankruptcy
laws. You are either a chicken or a duck, just like you are
either bankrupt or you're not."

Texaco Inc and Pennzoil Co are still
far apart on a settlement of their 10.3 billion dlrs dispute,
but both sides are still willing to settle, executives from
both companies said.
    Pennzoil chairman J. Hugh Liedtke, on the MacNeil/Lehrer
News Hour, said Pennzoil had offered to settle the dispute
along the lines suggested by Wall Street analysts - something
in the range of three to five billion dlrs - but Texaco Inc
president James Kinnear said it was the first time he heard the
three to five billion dlrs figure.
    Kinnear, on the television news program, said Pennzoil had
talked about four to five billion dlrs previously.
    Both executives, who were taped in separate interviews,
each accused the other of irresponsible actions in the ongoing
legal battle, which involves Texaco's 1984 takeover of Getty
Oil Co.
    Yesterday, Texaco filed for protection under Chapter 11 of
the U.S. Bankruptcy code, stating it was unable to continue its
business because of the legal fight.
    Liedtke said Pennzoil is prepared to litigate the matter as
long as it takes to bring the case to a final conclusion.
    Lietke said he thought it would take about 18 months to two
years to conclude the case.
    Asked if chance of a settlement were out the window,
Liedtke replied, "I've never thought that was the case. I
always believed this could be settled. But it will never be
settled as long as Texaco has the position that it has that
either you will settle with us on our basis or we will hold our
breath till we die." 
    But Kinnear said, "we offered a big reasonable settlement."
    Kinnear also seemed to confirm remarks made at an analysts
meeting earlier today where Texaco said it would only settle
the matter for far less than what it offered before.
    "The offers we made yesterday won't be repeated tomorrow,"
Kinnear said.
    Kinnear charged that Pennzoil was "using extortionary
pressure to deny us the ability to conduct our business." He
said that pressure forced the company into its Chapter 11
filing. 
    But he added he still hoped the dispute would be settled.

Members of the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange (CME) rejected a membership petition to ban dual
trading in Standard and Poor's 500 stock index futures and
options on futures, the exchange said.
    Members voted 1,272 to 525 against a proposal to prohibit
members from filling customer orders and trading for their own
account, known as dual trading, in the S and P contracts.
    Instead of an outright ban on dual trading, the CME board
adopted new rules, which include limitations on dual trading in
stock index products, that will now be sent to the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission for approval.
    The new rules will limit the use of the top step in the S
and P 500 futures and options pits, where the most active
contract is traded, to brokers filling customer orders only.
They may not transact business for their own account.
    The CME last week hired a new compliance officer and
increased the staff of the market surveillance department to
enhance security and regulation of the exchange.
    The rule changes also require brokers in S and P futures
and options to manually record to the nearest minute the time
of all personal trades in stock index products.
    Finally, the board voted to impose strict limits on trading
within broker groups applicable to the entire exchange and
redefined broker groups to more completely cover all forms of
associations. A percentage limitation on the personal trading
of a broker group member with other members of the group, and a
percentage limitation on filling orders between members of the
same broker group, will be set.
    John Sandner, CME board chairman, said in a statement the
original petition would have adversely affected liquidity,
discriminated against every broker and deprived all customers
of their right to choose a broker who is a dual trader.

The Washington Post said the U.S.
Commerce Department yesterday issued a new report showing that
the U.S. Merchandise trade deficit was 13.65 billion dollars in
February, a reduction of 1.4 billion dlrs from the 15.06
billion figure the department reported only two days earlier.
    The newspaper said: "News of the unexpectedly large 15
billion deficit helped batter the dollar's value on foreign
exchange markets and boosted U.S. Interest rates.
    "However, the new report went largely unnoticed by financial
markets since such a downward revision in the deficit is a
monthly occurrence."
    The Washington Post said: "By law, the department must first
publish what a top commerce official agreed are misleading
trade figures and then wait 48 hours before putting out the
more accurate ones."
    No one was immediately available at the Commerce Department
for comment on the Washington Post report.

The Bank of Japan said it forecast
Japan's broadly-defined M-2 money supply average plus
certificates of deposit (CDs) will rise by about nine pct in
the current April-June quarter against 8.5 pct a year earlier.
    Unadjusted M-2 plus CDs rose a preliminary 8.8 pct in
January/March 1987 compared with a nine pct rise a year
earlier, it said.
    The bank said the forecast rise is due to an increase in
floating deposits due to recent low interest rates and a shift
to private banks from the Bank of Japan of 400-1,000 billion
yen by the recently privatised Japanese Railways.

Consumer prices in the countries of the
Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)
rose 0.3 pct in February and inflation rose to 2.4 pct
year-on-year, the OECD said in a communique.
    The OECD attributed the rise in consumer prices to the
effects of the February 1986 drop in energy prices working
their way out of the index. The February increase was less than
Janauary's 0.4 pct increase but slightly above the average for
the later months of 1986.
    Inflation in the 24 western industrialised nations in
January was a revised 1.9 pct year-on-year. 
    Retail energy prices rose by 0.3 pct, less than January's
1.1 pct increase. Energy prices for consumers were still nine
pct lower than a year earlier, it said.
    Consumer prices excluding food and energy rose 0.3 pct in
February, in line with previous months, although there has been
some acceleration noticeable in the U.S. And Britain.
    Among the leading seven industrial countries, consumer
price inflation was highest in Italy at 4.2 pct, followed by
Canada at 4.0 pct, Britain at 3.9 pct, France at 3.4 pct, the
U.S. At 2.1 pct and West Germany and Japan with negative rates
of 0.5 pct and 1.4 pct respectively.

A strike by machinists

     Capt. Henry A. Duffy, president of the Air Line Pilots
Association, told a group of aviation executives meeting in
Atlanta Duffy said the pilots' union has a contract through
1988 with Eastern Airlines.
    However, a contract between Eastern and the International
Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers is due to

    If the machinists strike, which seems likely, Eastern
pilots probably would refuse to cross picket lines, he added.
    Noting that the pilots' union had clashed several times
with Eastern's parent, Texas Air Corp <TEX.A>, Duffy said, "We
have had a difficult relationship with Texas Air wherever they
have existed in the industry."
    Eastern's pilots had picketed the airline recently over new
sick leave policies and Duffy repeated criticisms of those
policies in his speech today.
    "The new policies pressure us to try to fly when we're sick
against federal air regulations and pressure us to fly beyond
federal air limits," Duffy said. "For all those reasons, we don't
see a very happy future over there."

Employees of Morton Thiokol Inc
<MTI.N> have gone to the FBI with allegations of fraud by the
firm in the manufacture of booster rockets blamed for the 1986
Challenger explosion, ABC News reported.
    According to the report, some Morton Thiokol employees went
to the FBI in Salt Lake City, Utah, with their allegations last
January 15.
    An FBI criminal investigation into Morton Thiokol began in
late January, although FBI officials have refused to confirm
whether the probe was related to the Challenger disaster.
    FBI spokesman Ray McElhaney refused to discuss the report
today, saying FBI officials could not comment about current 
investigations.
    The space shuttle Challenger exploded after takeoff Jan
28, 1986, when the temperature at the Florida launch site was
20 degrees below that specified for the O-rings that hold the
solid-rocket boosters together.
    The rings failed and all seven shuttle astronauts died in
the explosion.
    Morton Thiokol, based in Chicago, built the Challenger's
boosters in its Utah facility.
    The allegations by the employees follow similar charges by
former Morton-Thiokol engineer Roger Boisjoly, who has filed
two lawsuits alleging criminal fraud against his former
employer.

shares to 50 mln from 21 mln and for the authorization of a new
class of 20 mln preferred shares.  It said it will also ask
approval for a change in state of incorporation to Delaware to
take advantage of more flexible corporation laws and new
provisions regarding director liability.
    Genex said the new preferred will have the right to elect a

converted, common shares outstanding would more than double.
    The company is now incorporated in Maryland.

Amoco Corp is apparently the successful
bidder for debt-laden Dome Petroleum Ltd, according to a
published report.
    The Toronto Globe and Mail, quoting sources close to the
negotiations, today said Dome broke off talks last night with
TransCanada PipeLines Ltd, which last week announced a 4.3
billion Canadian dlr offer for all of Dome's assets.
    No financial details about the Amoco offer were available
and a Dome spokesman would neither confirm nor deny that Amoco
had emerged the winner, the newspaper said.
    However, the Dome spokesman indicated that the sale of Dome
could be finalized and announced this weekend, the Globe and
Mail said.
    Representatives of Amoco were not immediately available for
comment.
    Last Sunday, when TransCanada announced its offer, Dome
said it was also in talks with two other companies, but refused
to identify them.
    Since then, market speculation has centered on Amoco and
Exxon Corp's <XON> 70 pct-owned Imperial Oil Ltd subsidiary in
Canada.
    British Petroleum PLC <BP> and Royal Dutch/Shell Group <RD>
have also been mentioned as possible suitors for Dome.
    In the past two days, Dome management has been pressured by
the federal government to select the offer from TransCanada,
the only Canadian company in the bidding.
    Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's government appears to want
to avoid a Dome sale to a foreign company since the government
gave Dome hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks to
encourage oil and gas exploration in the Arctic, analysts and
officials have said.
    A purchase by TransCanada would be least likely to run
afoul of Canadian antitrust laws, however, TransCanada is
asking for tax concessions from a federal government that is
trying to hold its deficit below 30 billion Canadian dlrs,
analysts have said.
    A takeover by Amoco or Imperial would also give a foreign
oil company a dominant position in Canada's oil industry.
    Imperial Oil is already Canada's largest energy company,
with 1986 revenues of 7.1 billion Canadian dlrs. Chicago-based
Amoco had 1986 revenues of 20.23 billion U.S. dlrs. Its Amoco
Canada Petroleum subsidiary is 100 pct owned by Amoco Corp.

Chrysler Corp said it is asking
shareholders to increase the number of shares of authorized
common stock to 500 mln from the current 300 mln.
    The company, in the proxy statement mailed to 135,000
stockholders for its May 21 annual meeting in Savannah, Ga., 
said the added shares will be needed to complete its proposed
buyout of American Motors Corp <AMO>.
    Chrysler also said the additional shares could be used for
future acquisitions, financing transactions, stock dividends or
splits and employee benefit plans.
    The company also said in the proxy statement for its annual

for a supplemental executive retirement plan under its

based on 1986 performance.

Shadows and Dodge Daytonas.
    The checks will be redeemable at participating dealers in

Danners Inc said it has agreed in
principle for Indian LP, a partnership associated with Sherman
Clay Group, to purchase 100,000 shares of redeemable voting
junior preferred stock with a liquidation preference of 20 dlrs
per share and cumulative dividends of 1.60 dlrs per share
annually for two mln dlrs.
    It said the partnership would also receive detachable
warrants to buy 1,600,000 common shares at 1.25 dlrs each,
payable in cash or in junior preferred stock at the liquidation
preference value.                            
    Danners said completion of the infusion would allow the
partnership to name a majority of its board.
    In addition, Danners said it granted the partnership an
option to buy 200,000 more common shares at 1.25 dlrs each,
exercisable if it should fail to meet any condition connected
with the transaction or if principal shareholders should accept
a merger offer from another party.  It said Danners family
members owning 171,538 shares have granted options to Indian to
buy their shares on similar terms and conditions.
    The company said the Danner family options provide that if
the infusion is completed, the partnership will have the option
starting six months later and ending in April 1992 to buy the
shares at the last bid or last sales price, whichever is lower.
    Danners said the agreement is subject to a recapitalization
by its bank group of outstanding loans, satisfactory company
prospects, favorable opinon from an investment banker and
closing by April 30, with possible extensions to no later than
May 11.
    The company lost 529,000 dlrs in the prior year.
    Danners said it has terminated its use of LIFO inventory
accounting, resulting in a restatement of its net worth as of
February 1, 1986, the last day of its prior fiscal year, to
15.5 mln dlrs from 9,901,000 dlrs.  But losses for the year
just ended will result in a net worth deficiency at the end of
that year of about 4,400,000 dlrs or eight dlrs per share.
    The company said it incurred unusual fourth quarter losses
due to the previously-announced closing and disposition of 17
of its 35 3D discount department stores, inventory clearances
and conversion to a new pricing and promotion system.
    The company said if it should fail to perform under the
deal, it could be liable for all expenses incurred by the
partnership.  If it does perform but the infusion transaction
collapses for another reason, it said it could be liable for up
to 50,000 dlrs in expenses.
    It said the Danner family members who have agreed to the
option have the ability to sell some or all of their shares to
the partnership around the closing date at two dlrs each.
    Danners further said it expects to report a loss for the
year ended January 31 of over 19 mln dlrs, substantially worse
than it had expected.
    The company said it also incurred losses in the fourth
quarter on the disposition of nonoperating assets.  It said it
expects to report results for the year soon.
    Danners said problems with its credit relationships,
together with its losses for the year, resulted in its
transaction with Indian, which is intended to alleviate its
problems.

White House Budget chief James
Miller said he was concerned that the Federal Reserve might
"overreact" to the decline in the value of the U.S. dollar by
raising interest rates, a move he said could cause a recession
next year.
    "Our greatest danger is overreaction," Miller told newspaper
reporters yesterday. "I'm concerned about the Fed's
overreaction. I'm concerned about what I see in recent data
showing a substantial fall in the money supply."
    Edwin Dale, Miller's spokesman, said the remarks, published
in the New York Times today, were accurate.
    Miller said he was concerned the Fed might overreact to
signals of rising inflation by tightening credit -- a move he
said could have "political consequences."
    The White House budget chief appeared to be referring to
the effect an economic slowdown could have on the presidential
and congressional elections next year.
    "My fear is that if we get into a recession we are in deep
soup, and there is no question about it," he said.
    Miller said an economic slowdown could lead to lower tax
revenues and a widening of the budget deficit.
    Miller's remarks reflected concern that the U.S. central
bank might feel compelled to tighten credit as a means of
bolstering the dollar.
    Both Treasury Secretary James Baker and Federal Reserve
Board Chairman Paul Volcker recently have warned that further
declines in the value of the U.S. dollar could jeopardize
global growth prospects.
    U.S. officials have urged Japan and West Germany to
stimulate economic growth in their countries -- a move that
could boost U.S. exports and relieve trade protectionist
pressures in the United States.

The Bank of France said in its latest
monthly report on the French economy it expected a pickup in
industrial production registered in March to gather steam over
the next few months.
    Without giving figures, the report said last month's rise,
partly linked to efforts to catch up with production lost
earlier this year through industrial action, was due mainly to
a firming of domestic demand.
    "New progress is expected in all main sectors except capital
goods where production will remain at its present level," the
report added.
    The upbeat report comes in the wake of grim March trade
balance figures which showed a deficit in industrial trade for
the first time since June 1982.
    While the automobile industry remained unchanged from
previously boosted levels, consumer goods production grew and
was expected to accelerate except in the area of domestic
appliances. Semi-finished goods showed a clear increase in all
sectors. Construction and civil engineering, boosted by a rise
in public works, also improved, while retail trade sales in all
sectors continued to slow.

The Commerce Department said on that
insurance and freight costs for imported goods of 1.45 billion
dlrs were included in the February trade deficit of 15.1
billion dlrs reported on Tuesday.
    The department is required by law to wait 48 hours after
the initial trade report to issue a second report on a "customs
value" basis, which eliminates the freight and insurance
charges from the cost of imports.
    Private-sector economists emphasized that the Commerce
Department was not revising down the deficit by 1.45 billion
dlrs but simply presenting the figures on a different basis.
    A report in the Washington Post caused a stir in the
foreign exchanges today because it gave the impression, dealers
said, that the underlying trade deficit for February had been
revised downward.
    The Commerce department would like to have the law changed
to permit it to report both sets of figures simultaneously.
    "My feeling is the second one is a better report but there's
legislation that requires us to delay it two days," said Robert
Ortner, Commerce undersecretary for economic affairs.
    "But this has been going on for a long time and no one pays
any attention to the second figure."
    The 15.1 billion dlr February trade deficit compared with a
revised January deficit of 12.3 billion dlrs.
    The law requiring a 48-hour delay in publishing the monthly
trade figure excluding freight and insurance was passed in
1979.
    Reportedly the feeling was the first figure, which includes
customs, freight and insurance, allowed a better comparison
with other countries that reported their trade balances on the
same basis.
    The second figure, which would always be lower by deducting
freight and insurance, presents the deficit in a more favorable
light for the Reagan administration.
    Ortner said he would like to see the law changed to
eliminate the 48-hour delay in reporting the two figures.
    "We're considering it," he said, "It's one of those dinosaur
laws and I think it's time has come."

their parliamentarians, at a meeting at the LDP headquarters,
they said. The MPs represented seemed to Account for one-third

    The group is an LDP voluntary organisation, called the

    Meanwhle, Nakasone this evening hinted that his party might
be ready to accept some modification to the five-pct sales tax
proposal after the fiscal 1987 state budget plan was passed by
parliament. The LDP suffered a setback in last Sunday's local
elections because of the controvertial tax plan. The result
also undermined Nakasone's prestige, giving rise to a
possibility that he might be forced out of office before
October 30, when he is supposed to step down.

Damon Corp's Damon Clinical
Laboratories expects to report "significantly better" profits
this year and a 20 pct gain in sales due in part to increased
testing for AIDS virus, Damon president Joe Isola said.
     Last year the unit earned 8.6 mln dlrs on sales of 97.3
mln for the fiscal year ended August 31, 1986. Overall, Damon
Corp reported a loss of 2.5 mln dlrs on sales of 148 mln.
     Isola attributed the loss to the company's biotechnology
subsidiary.
     Damon Labs currently tests about 8,000 samples a night for
the AIDS virus at its Irving, Texas, facility. That's an
increase of about 100 percent from 18 months ago when the U.S.
Army chose the company to test for Acquired Immune Deficiency
Syndrome among its recruits.
     Now, in addition to recruits, the company processes
regular Army soldiers undergoing annual physicals, Army
Reserves, the National Guard as well as some Coast Guard and
Naval Reserves.
     Despite having a capacity for processing 10,000 samples a
day, Damon Labs recently decided to move out of its Irving
facility into a larger one close by and from April 25 on will
be able to process some 16,000 a day.
     He said AIDS testing was expected to contribute 18 mln
dlrs to sales over the next three to four years, adding that
some 80 pct of the AIDS testing was military-related.
     Despite the enormous number of tests being processed each
day, he said there had never been a mistake.

caused by the failure of the valve system to meet contract
specifications and licensing requirements.
    The ball-type main steam isolation valve system was removed

reporters at New York Auto Show's press opening.
    Commenting on GM's previously announced move to replace the

the old system did not fit with the company's strategy of long

The former chief executive officer
of Baldwin-United Corp, now known as PHLCorp <PHX>, agreed to
settle charges stemming from misleading financial statements
the company is accused of making before it collapsed in 1983.
    Under the settlement with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, former Baldwin-United President Morley Thompson
agreed to an order issued by the U.S. District Court in
Cincinnati, Ohio, barring him from committing further
securities law violations.
    Thompson did not admit or deny the charges.
    Although Thompson was the last of several defendants to
settle charges brought by the SEC on September 26, 1985 in
connection with the Baldwin-United case, the agency said it is
continuing to investigate other matters related to the company
and may bring charges against other people.
    Baldwin-United, a Cincinnati-based diversified financial
services holding company, went bankrupt in September 1983. It
changed its name last November to PHLCorp.
    The SEC said Thompson violated reporting and anti-fraud
provisions of federal securities laws in late 1982 by issuing
misleading press releases.
    Baldwin-United, which has already settled SEC charges
brought against it, made "false statements concerning the
financing for two corporate acquisitions," the SEC said.
    The statements indicated that the company had available
cash for the takeovers while it was actually facing a "serious
cash flow crisis," it said.
    The company was also accused of filing false and misleading
financial statements with the SEC.

Japan is faced with a mounting crisis
over its huge trade surplus and recognizes that it must act
more quickly to refocus its export driven economy, a senior
Foreign Ministry official said.
    "The sense of crisis among the Japanese public as well as
the government is increasing," Deputy Director General Hiroshi
Hirabayashi told reporters. "The need to accelerate the efforts
(to restructure the economy) is well recognized."
    Hirabayashi said that gradual progress had been made to
refocus the Japanese economy, but admitted that it might not
seem all that spectacular to foreign observers.
    Difficulties had been encountered in implementing the
so-called Maekawa report since it was unveiled a year ago, he
said. But, he added, foreign governments should appreciate the
efforts that have been made.
    The report, named for its principal author, former Bank of
Japan governor Haruo Maekawa, called for a shift in Japan's
economy away from its dependence on exports for growth. The
Japanese cabinet today reviewed progress made since its
release.
    According to Hirabayashi, Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone
told his fellow ministers that Japan must follow the direction
set out by Maekawa and urged them to make efforts to achieve
it.
    Foreign Minister Tadashi Kuranari added that not enough had
been done to publicize the action Japan was taking to refocus
its economy.
    Listing some of those actions, Hirabayashi said imports of
manufactured goods have increased, interest rates have fallen,
and coal, steel and non-ferrous metal output have been reduced.
    He expressed hope that Japan will act more quickly in the
future to implement the report and scoffed at a suggestion that
it would take ten years for Maekawa's goals to be met.
    "It will not take very much time to fulfill the (goals) set
out by the Maekawa report," he said.

The Supreme Court, in a 6-3
decision, ruled that an Indiana law aimed at protecting
companies from hostile takeovers by out-of-state businesses is
constitutional.
    The high court justices reversed a ruling by a U.S. Court
of Appeals in Chicago that struck down the 1986 control-share
acquisition law.
    The case involved a hostile takeover bid by Dynamics Corp
of America against CTS Corp, based in Elkhart, Ind.
    Dynamics made a tender offer in 1985 for one million shares
to bring its holdings of CTS stock to 27.5 pct of the company's
total.
   
    After CTS invoked the state law, Dynamics filed a lawsuit
challenging the constitutionality of the measure.
    One effect of the law is to impose a 50-day delay on the
tender offer at the option of the target company.
    It also requires that the acquisition for control shares in
an Indiana corporation does not include voting rights unless a
majority of all pre-existing shareholders so agree at their
next regularly scheduled meeting.
    Justice Lewis Powell, writing for the court majority, held
that the state law was not pre-empted by federal securities
law.
   
    "The Indiana Act protects independent shareholders from the
coercive aspects of tender offers by allowing them to vote as a
group," he said.
    He acknowledged that the law may delay some tender offers
and may decrease the number of successful tender offers for
Indiana corporations.
    But he said the law does not discriminate against
interstate commerce and was justified by the state's interests
in protecting shareholders.

Falconbridge Ltd said it expected
results for the rest of 1987 to improve from the earlier
reported first quarter operating loss of 15.4 mln dlrs.
    Chief executive William James told reporters after the
annual meeting that "I would hope that the loss for the year
certainly wouldn't be a high as the loss for the first quarter.
In other words we are going to make money from here on in."
    Falconbridge last year made a first quarter operating loss
of 17.1 mln dlrs and a full-year operating loss of 15.5 mln
dlrs.
    James said currency losses tied to the stronger Canadian
dollar resulted for about eight mln dlrs of the first quarter
operating loss. Falconbridge records its cash and accounts
receivable in U.S. dollars, with the Canadian dollar equivalent
decreasing as the U.S. dollar falls.
    He said the first quarter loss also stemmed from weaker
nickel and ferronickel prices and lower production at the
company's Sudbury, Ontario nickel operations and at some Kidd
Creek operations. Falconbridge anticipates higher production
through the rest of the year and higher average prices this
year for precious metals, James added, without elaborating.
    Falconbridge has no immediate plans for further
divestments, James said in reply to reporters' inquiries. The
company sold several mining subsidiaries last year to help pay
down debt from its January, 1986 acquisition of Kidd Creek
Mines Ltd from Canada Development Corp <CDC.TO>.
    He said Falconbridge's debt now totaled about one billion
dlrs, down from 1.37 billion dlrs at the time of the Kidd Creek
buy.
    James said he could not assess the impact of Amoco Corp
<AN>'s proposed acquisition of Dome Petroleum Ltd <DMP>. Dome's
23 pct-owned Dome Mines Ltd <DM> owns 21 pct of Falconbridge.
    Asked by reporters if Falconbridge preferred competing Dome
bidder, Calgary, Alberta-based TransCanada PipeLines Ltd to
Chicago-based Amoco, James replied, "It makes no difference to
me...whoever takes it over is fine by us."
    He told shareholders that Falconbridges' planned capital
expenditures this year would decline to 134 mln dlrs from 160
mln dlrs last year.

Quantum Fund N.V., a Netherlands
Antilles mutual fund for which New York investor George Soros
is investment adviser, said it has agreed to limit further
purchases of Fairchild Industries Inc stock.
    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Quantum, which already holds 1,647,481 Fairchild common shares,
or 11.5 pct of the total outstanding, said it agreed to the
restriction after Fairchild said its security clearance might
be jeopardized if Quantum acquires a major stake in it.
    But Quantum said Fairchild management was told that Soros,
acting either individually or through entities other than
Quantum that he controls, may decide to buy common stock in the
company on his own behalf.
    Quantum had recently notified the Federal Trade Commission
under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976
that it might buy up to 49.9 pct of Fairchild's voting stock.
Unless the FTC had objected, Quantum would have been free, but
not obligated, to buy up to 49.9 pct of Fairchild stock.
    Fairchild management, however, warned that if Quantum, a
foreign entity, raises its stake in the company to 49.9 pct, it
could "impair" the government security clearances Fairchild
needs to carry out its its defense contract work.
    In response, Quantum said it told Fairchild it will not
make "significant additional purchases" of its common or
preferred stock without giving Fairchild enough prior notice to
enable it to consult with Quantum over the impact of action.
    Quantum also said it has withdrawn its notification request
to the FTC and the antitrust division of the Justice Department
of its intent to buy up to 49.9 pct of Fairchild.
    Quantum also said it told the FTC and the Justice
Department that it does not expect to resubmit any further
notifications of intent to significantly raise its stake in
Fairchild at this time.
    The restrictions Quantum has agreed to follow regarding
further dealings in Fairchild stock do not apply to Soros as an
individual investor.
     Fairchild's annual shareholders meeting is scheduled to be

Congress returned from its Easter
recess ready for the annual Spring budget battle that promises
to be a partisan dispute.
    The budget fight pitting Democrats against President Reagan
and Republicans is expected to get underway this week in the
Senate late this week and last at least another week. It is
taking on new prominence because of current trade woes.
    That is because the budget problems and its associated huge
deficits are said to be at the root of related international
trade friction currently worrying financiers.
    As the dollar slides downward on global markets and stock
exchanges gyrate wildly, the trade dispute involving the United
States and Japan once again is spreading fears of a major trade
war between the two trading giants for the first time since
World War II.
    Ostensibly that dispute is over U.S. charges that Japan is
refusing to open its markets to semi-conductor chips and the
resulting U.S. tariffs doubling prices of Japanese televisions
and small computers.
    Behind the elements of a brewing trade war which neither
side wants, is the dilemma of the U.S. budget and its deficit.
    Some analysts say the financial markets may be waking up to
the economic realities that the huge debt cannot continue to
grow without repercussions.
    A large portion of the U.S. debt has been financed by
foreigners from their accumulated trade surpluses. But if they
withdraw this support the result can only be further problems,
including higher interest rates for Americans.
    In a nutshell, the U.S. budget process has now moved to the
showdown stages in Congress. Reagan's own trillion dollar
spending budget for the government year 1988, starting Oct. 1,
was trounced badly in the House on April 9.
    The Senate takes up a plan similar to one that passed the
House, calling for slashing the deficit from its estimated 171
billion dlr level next year to about 134 billion dlrs, through
defense and domestic spending cuts and about 18.5 billion dlrs
in new, unspecified, taxes. As the Senate prepares to take up
its own budget plan, majority Democrats predict there will be
passage of a bill, only after a protracted partisan battle.
    In the House, not one Republican voted for the budget,
which passed by 230 to 192. In the Senate, none of Reagan's
Republicans voted for the budget as it passed out of the Senate
Budget Committee for full Senate consideration.

The Securities and Exchange
Commission reminded securities dealers that its mark-up
disclosure requirements also applies to transactions on
zero-coupon securities.
    Dealers and brokers are required by U.S. securities law to
disclose their mark-ups if they are excessive, the SEC said in
a public notice.
    Further, excessive mark-ups on securities transactions,
whether disclosed or not, violate the rules of the national
Association of Securities Dealers Inc and Municipal Securities
Rulemaking Board, it said.
    In a separate action, the SEC filed a friend-of-the-court
brief in a private civil case involving a complaint against
Merrill Lynch over excessive mark-ups on zero-coupon bonds. The
case is being appealed to the U.S. Appeals Court.
    The lower court dismissed the complaint, finding antifraud
provisions of securities laws do not prohibit undisclosed
excessive mark-ups on securities transactions.
    The SEC is urging the appeals court to reverse the
decision, citing its nearly 50 year-old position that
undisclosed excessive mark-ups by securities dealers violate
the general antifraud provisions of securities laws.

U.S. banking data released today are
too distorted to draw sweeping conclusions about monetary
policy, but they do support the market's assumption that the
Federal Reserve has started to tighten its grip on credit,
economists said.
    "It's clear that the Fed has firmed somewhat. Discount
window borrowings, net free reserves, the Fed funds rate
average and the pattern of reserve additions are all consistent
with a modest tightening," said Dana Johnson of First Chicago
Corp.
    Johnson, and several other economists, now estimate that
the Fed funds rate should trade between 6-1/4 and 6-3/8 pct.
    Discount window borrowings in the week to Wednesday were
935 mln dlrs a day, producing a daily average for the two-week
statement period of 689 mln dlrs, the highest since the week of
December 31, 1986, and up from 393 mln dlrs previously.
    Moreover, banks were forced to borrow a huge 5.2 billion
dlrs from the Fed on Wednesday - the highest daily total this
year - even though unexpectedly low Treasury balances at the
Fed that day left banks with over two billion dlrs more in
reserves than the Fed had anticipated.
    However, economists said it is almost certain that the Fed
is aiming for much lower discount window borrowings than
witnessed this week. They pointed to two factors that may have
forced banks to scramble for reserves at the end of the week.
    First, economists now expect M-1 money supply for the week
ended April 29 to rise by a staggering 15 to 20 billion dlrs,
partly reflecting the parking in checking accounts of the
proceeds from stock market sales and mutual fund redemptions to
pay annual income taxes.
    As banks' checking-account liabilities rise, so do the
reserves that they are required to hold on deposit at the Fed.
    Required reserves did indeed rise sharply by 2.5 billion
dlrs a day in the two weeks ended Wednesday, but economists
said the Fed may not have believed in the magnitude of the
projected M-1 surge until late in the week and so started to
add reserves too late.
    Second, an apparent shortage of Treasury bills apparently
left Wall Street dealers with too little collateral with which
to enagage in repurchase agreements with the Fed, economists
said. Thus, although there were 10.3 billion dlrs of repos
outstanding on Wednesday night, the Fed may have wanted to add
even more reserves but was prevented from doing so.
    "It's not at all inconceivable that the Fed didn't add as
much as they wanted to because of the shortage of collateral,"
said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Economics Inc.
    McCarthy estimated that the Fed is now targetting
discount-window borrowings of about 400 mln dlrs a day,
equivalent to a Fed funds rate of around 6-3/8 pct.
    After citing the reasons why the Fed probably has not
tightened credit to the degree suggested by the data,
economists said the fact that the Fed delayed arranging 
overnight injections of reserves until the last day of the
statement period was a good sign of a more restrictive policy.
    Jeffrey Leeds of Chemical Bank had not been convinced that
the Fed was tightening policy. But after reviewing today's
figures, he said, "It's fair to say that the Fed may be moving
toward a slightly less accommodative reserve posture."
    Leeds expects Fed funds to trade between 6-1/4 and 6-3/8
pct and said the Fed is unlikely to raise the discount rate
unless the dollar's fall gathers pace.
    Johnson at First Chicago agreed, citing political
opposition in Washington to a dollar-defense package at a time
when Congress sees further dollar depreciation as the key to
reducing the U.S. trade surplus with Japan.

Parliament's Lower House passed the 1987
budget shortly before midnight local time, official
parliamentary sources said.
    The move followed agreement by the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party to a proposal that could kill its plan to
introduce a controversial sales tax, political analysts said.
The move was seen as a major blow to Prime Minister Yasuhiro
Nakasone, the leading advocate of the five pct tax, they said.
    Some analysts said Nakasone may be forced to step down
after the June summit of heads of major industrial democracies
and before his one-year term is due to expire at end-October.
    Under the compromise agreed by the LDP and opposition
parties, Lower House Speaker Kenzaburo Hara will take charge of
the sales tax bill, appoint a ruling/opposition party council
to debate it and allow opposition leaders to review the present
tax system, analysts said.
    Hara also verbally agreed to scrap the sales tax plan
entirely if the joint council fails to reach agreement on how
to handle the tax.
    The opposition parties, who have been vociferously
attacking the sales tax plan for months, hailed the decision as
a great victory.
    The opposition parties had already delayed passage of the
budget for three weeks after the April 1 start of the fiscal
year by intermittent parliamentary boycotts.
    Although the LDP had more than enough votes to ram the
budget through parliament, it had been reluctant to do so for
fear of a backlash of public opinion, especially after its
setback in recent local elections due to the sales tax issue.
    The ruling party though was anxious to pass the budget
before Nakasone leaves next week for the U.S. So that he could
tell Washington the Japanese government was doing its utmost to
boost the sagging economy and imports.
    According to Kyodo News Service, Nakasone told reporters he
did not think the sales tax was dead.
    If the sales tax is dropped, it could prove a major boost
to the economy because it would increase the government budget
deficit, economists said.
    The sales tax was originally scheduled to be introduced
next January to help offset the loss of government revenues
stemming from a cut in income and corporate taxes due to go
into effect this month.

styrene business saw significant improvement, stemming from an
increase in international demand.
    Resources earnings increased by six mln dlrs to 46 mln

removal of the Petroleum and Gas Revenue Tax, the impact of
lower royalty rates and higher volumes.

General Motors Corp's <GM> Bedford
Trucks subsidiary has signed a memorandum of understanding with

manufacturing joint venture in the U.K.
    The proposals would involve doubling output at the loss
making plant at Luton in southern England to around 40,000 vans
a year by 1990.
     Bedford, faced with reduced demand for heavy trucks in the
last few years, stopped most of its heavy truck production at
the end of 1986. GM would have a 60 pct stake in the venture
and Izuzu 40 pct
    GM holds a 38.6 pct stake in Isuzu.
    Bedford already has a link with Izuzu under which it
assembles some smaller Japanese vehicles in Britain.
    A Bedford spokesman said financial details of the deal had
not yet been finalised although it was anticipated that the
venture would start without debt.
    Currently the Luton van plant was estimated to be losing
some 500,000 stg a week, he added.
    Bedford's other truck plant, which manufactures military
vehicles and trucks in kit form for export, was not involved in
the venture.

Exxon Corp reported a 37 pct drop in
first quarter profits to 1.07 billion dlrs citing lower oil and
gas prices.
    The company said profits in the lastest quarter included a
26 mln drl restructuring gain from divestment of certain gold
operations overseas, while last year's first quarter profit of
1.71 billion dlrs included the initial charge of 235 mln dlrs
for its 1986 corporate reorganization.
    First quarter revenues were down 13 pct to 19.44 billion
dlrs.
   
    One time items aside, Exxon said, its first quarter results
were stronger than 1986's final quarter which included several
large asset sales and positive inventory adjustments.
    It said earnings per share declined 36 pct reflecting the
company's continued purchases of its own common for the
treasury. During the first quarter, 5,085,000 shares were
acquired at a cost of 416 mln dlrs compared with 3,132,000 in
1986's fourth quarter.
    Commenting on the first quarter, Exxon said crude oil
prices strengthened moderately within the quarter and were
higher than a year ago at the end of the quarter.
   
    However, average crude prices for the quarter were below
the year ago period, leading to lower earnings for exploration
and production operations, Exxon said.
    Also contributing to reduced earnings were lower natural
gas prices, primarily overseas, representing contract
adjustments representing contract adjustments tied to falling
product prices in 1986, the company said.
    During the first quarter, the company said, intense
competition in both domestic and international markets served
to depress margins for refined products.
   
    Exxon said the lower product margins resulted in
significantly reduced earnings for refining and marketing
operations, contrasting sharply with the unusually strong
margins prevailing in the first qtr of 1986.
    It said savings from efforts to control costs and improve
efficiency helped soften the negative impact of lower oil and
natural gas prices.
    Exxon said earnings from chemicals and power generation
activities showed consideratble improvement, remaining strong
throughout the period.

Shell Oil Co said first quarter net
income dropped 61 pct over the prior-year quarter on revenues
that slipped four pct.
    "Lower prices for crude oil and natural gas and reduced
margins in our oil and chemical products businesses were the
major factor for the earings decline," John F. Bookout,
president, said in a statement.
    For the quarter, the company, a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell
Group <RD> <SC>, earned 108 mln dlrs on sales of 4.50 billion
dlrs, compared with 276 mln dlrs on sales of 4.67 billion dlrs
a year ago.
    Bookout said the company is cautiously optimistic oil
markets will be less volatile in coming months than they were
in 1986.
    "In coming months, oil products results should benefit from
seasonally higher gasoline volumes," he said.
    "However, so long as U.S. product inventories remain high,
it may be difficult to fully recover from the depressed margins
of recent periods," he added.
    Bookout said the company's chemical products earnings
should benefit from strong performances in chemical sales
volumes and continued high industry operating rates.
    Shell said its oil and gas exploration and product segment
earned 110 mln dlrs for the quarter vs 91 mln dlrs in 1986.
    It said earnings were hurt by lower selling prices for
crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. Domestic crude
oil prices averaged 14.24 dlrs a barrel, compared with 19.28
dlrs last year, while natural gas prices dropped 24 pct, Shell
said.
    Shell said earnings at its oil products segment plunged by
53 mln dlrs, to eight mln dlrs. It said lower refined product
selling prices were only partially offset by reduced raw
material costs.
    The company said earnings from chemical products also fell
sharply, to 40 mln dlrs from 72 mln dlrs, due mainly to lower
margins, especially in commodity chemicals, coupled with its
pullout from the agricultural chemicals business in October
1986.
    Shell said capital and exploratory outlays totaled 500 mln
dlrs for the quarter, off from 645 mln dlrs.

West German banks face disruption
from strike ballots and selective strikes after the breakdown
of talks on wages and working hours, the German Employees
Union, DAG, and the Commerce, Banking and Insurance Union, HBV,
said.
    But the chairman of the bank employers' federation, Horst
Burgard, told reporters in Frankfurt he hoped the two sides
would reach agreement after a pause for thought.
    DAG chief negotiator Gerhard Renner said the employers'
offer to resume talks was farcical as long as they refused to
remove the issue of flexible working hours from the talks.
    Both sides agreed there was now little point in top level
negotiations similar to those held in the engineering industry
which resolved a dispute on working hours.
    Renner and HBV chief negotiator Lorenz Schwegler said they
were prepared to compromise on the issue of flexible working
hours, but this subject should not be included in the wage
negotiations for the 380,000 bank employees.
    Burgard, also management board member of Deutsche Bank AG,
said the employers sought acceptance of more flexible hours on
an unchanged 40 hour week in the negotiations.
    The employers have unilaterally imposed a 3.6 pct pay rise
backdated to March 1, with the collapse of the talks. The HBV
is seeking a six pct rise and DAG a 6.5 pct increase.
    Schwegler said the unions would react to the collapse of
the talks with protest and warning strikes. Union officials
would resist overtime and attempts to introduce flexible hours.
    Next week the unions will set strike ballots aiming at
strikes in sensitive areas such as bank computer and bourse
data centres. The unions only account for some 25 pct of bank
employees. DAG will seek support from its members in the

Rockwell International Corp <ROK.N> has
signed an agreement leading to the takeover of Valeo <VLOF.PA>
subsidiary <SO.M.A. Europe Transmissions>, Valeo said in a
statement.
    The company said Rockwell had agreed to handle Soma sales
around the world and to help Valeo in restructuring its
loss-making subsidiary.
    It also said Rockwell, an American high-technology
engineering group with interests in aerospace and the car
industry, would take control of Soma at the beginning of 1988
if it obtained approval from the French government.
    Soma, a fully owned subsidiary of Valeo, makes axles and
gear boxes for heavy vehicles and machinery mostly used in the
construction business. A Valeo spokesman said <S.E.S.M.>, a
subsidiary of Soma specialized in equipment for military
vehicles, had been excluded from the agreement with Rockwell.
     He said no details were available on the eventual amount
Rockwell would pay for Soma.
    Vehicle components maker Valeo was the object of a takeover
bid in 1986 by Italian group <Compagnie Industriali Riunite>
(CIR), controlled by Olivetti chairman Carlo de Benedetti.
    The French government limited CIR's holding in Valeo to
less than 30 pct in June 1986, after classifying Valeo as a
defence contractor. Today CIR has effective control of Valeo
through its French holding company <Compagnies Europeenes
Reunies>, Cerus, which has a 18.24 pct stake in Valeo.
    Since CIR won control of the French group in June, Valeo
has pursued a policy of concentrating its activities on the car
industry. The company spokesman said Valeo had sold off all its
construction interests in 1986 but declined to comment on the
amount of the sales.
    The spokesman said figures were not available on Soma's
losses in 1986 but said the company had registered a turnover
of 546 mln francs. Valeo recorded a consolidated net loss of
388 mln francs in 1986 on a turnover of 12.1 billion francs.

Unless U.S. refiners reduce the amount
of gasoline they now produce, the oil industry will enter the
coming summer driving season with the largest surplus of motor
fuel since 1984, oil analysts and traders said.
    "They key question is how much gasoline refiners produce in
the coming weeks," said Larry Goldstein of Petroleum Industry
Research Inc. "If refiners cut output and demand turns upward,
gasoline stocks could begin to draw, and the surplus could
potentially turn around in four to eight weeks," said
Goldstein.
    The American Petroleum Institute said U.S. gasoline stocks
for the week ended April 17 are 37.6 mln barrels above last
year's levels, and analysts said they don't believe the
expected one to two pct rise in demand will take care of the
surplus before the start of the summer driving season, which
begins Memorial Day weekend.
    The API said the last time stocks were this high was in
1984, when there was a 27 mln barrel excess. Oil traders said
that the surplus held throughout the summer of 1984, depressing
prices for the motor fuel.
    Over the past several weeks, analysts said they expected
refiners to reduce production because there was no profit in
continued production of gasoline due to the surplus. However,
refineries continued to operate at higher levels, they said.
    U.S. refineries have been running at about 78.8 pct of
capacity during March and April this year, compared to 77.5 at
this time last year, API statistics show.
    Because of the current excess in stocks, one planner for a
major oil company said he believed that most companies are
contemplating cutting refinery throughput over the near term.
    He said some refiners appear to be selling less
aggressively in order to have product on hand to meet the
expected rise in demand this summer.
    Goldstein said that other factors, such as higher speed
limits, the gasoline lead phasedown, and possible new
restrictions on gasoline vapor pressure could tighten the
supply situation this summer.
    However, a planner at another major oil company said that
although large inventories are dampening the price outlook for
gasoline this season, he does not expect refiners to cut output
soon.
    That oil company planner said high crude oil runs reduce
the refiner's average costs, making the incremental barrel of
gasoline cheaper to produce.
    Most analysts expect a slight upturn this summer over the
summer of 1986. Bo Poates, an analyst at the Energy Futures
Group Inc said he foresees demand up about one pct in the
second and third quarters of 1987.
    Chase Econometrics' Scott Jones sees gasoline demand rising
1.9 to 2.2 pct for the year, due mainly to continued low
prices.

Commission house livestock analysts
agreed with Chicago Mercantile Exchange floor traders in
calling today's USDA 13-state quarterly cattle on feed report
and cold storage report for pork bellies negative.
    June live cattle futures are called 0.20 to 0.50 cent lower
on Monday and back months of cattle are expected 0.50 to 1.00
cent lower. Pork bellies are expected 0.50 to 1.00 cent or more
lower, the analysts said.
    Disappointment was voiced over the placement and total on
feed figures in the cattle report. Both the quarterly section
and monthly 7-state part showed the amount placed on feed and
on feed numbers at the high end of expectations.
    The other disappearance figure of only three pct above a
year ago in the 7-state section was also vieved as negative.
Most of the early guesses predicted a much larger number for
death loss following the two winter snow storms that struck the
west in late March, they said.
    However, weight groupings were friendly to the nearby
futures and should prompt some bull spreading on the decline,
they said.
    William Arndt from Dean Witter noted that the 900 to 1,100
lb steers and 700 to 900 lb heifers were at 94 pct of a year
ago and should lend some support to June futures. However, 700
to 900 lb steers at 119 pct will weigh on August, he said.
    "The big reduction in cattle weighing over 900 lbs should
be friendly to the market for at least the next 30 to 60 days,"
AGE Clearing analyst Jerry Abbenhaus said.
    Movement of bellies into frozen storage was at the high end
of expectations and should weigh on futures tomorrow,
especially as futures prices ended weak today, they said.
    Other parts of the cold storage report were also viewed as
negative to livestock and meat futures.
    "We have a lot of poultry in storage. Even though we have
smaller pork supplies, the decline is not enough to offset the
increases in poultry," Shearson Lehman analyst Chuck Levitt
said. Also, there is more beef in storage than last year and
this was achieved on smaller production.

The Bundesbank is trying to keep
monetary policy tight in order to counter inflationary
tendencies, Bundesbank Vice-President Helmut Schlesinger was
quoted as saying.
    "We are trying to keep the monetary framework tight, so that
inflationary pressures cannot develop," he told the Frankfurter
Neue Presse daily in an interview.
    "Central bank money stock does not have to be reduced
because of this, but it must continue to grow modestly," he
said.
    Bundesbank spokesmen were not available for comment.
    On Thursday Schlesinger said in a contribution to the
Handelsblatt daily that the accommodative monetary stance in
West Germany caused by outside pressures could not determine
policy in the long term.
    The improvement in West German terms of trade, providing
room for non-inflationary expansion of domestic demand in
excess of output growth, put the overshoot of central bank
money stock in a more positive light, he said on Thursday.
    Central bank money stock, the Bundesbank's main monetary
measure, was growing at an annual rate of 7.3 pct in March,
above the 1987 three-six pct target range.
    Money stock overshot the 3.5-5.5 pct 1986 growth target.
    Schlesinger told the Frankfurter Neue Presse that the phase
of falling prices was over in West Germany.
    Prices might still be lower on a comparison with their
level one year earlier. But the cost of living index has risen
to 120.7 in March from its November 1986 low of 120.0,
expressing a slight rise in prices, Schlesinger said.
    In March the cost of living was steady against February but
0.2 pct below March 1986.
    Schlesinger said a rise of between one and 1.5 pct during
1987 would be acceptable, and effectively mean price stability.
    Agreements so far in the current West German wage round are
neutral as far as inflation is concerned because of the
strength of the mark, Schlesinger said.
    Wage agreements in the public service and engineering
industry were relatively high in view of the stable cost of
living. But the higher costs would be compensated for, he said.
    "I am thinking above all of the fact that in the course of
this year we will in all probability have a stronger mark
against other currencies than last year," he said, adding
"Without this mark revaluation effect, we would have had to say
that the wage rise agreements were not neutral for prices."
    Schlesinger said exchange rate movements had increased the
scope for redistributing wealth this year, but this development
was unlikely to continue in 1988.
    "For this reason I cannot comment on that part of the
engineering agreement which covers the coming years," he said.
    Some 2.3 mln workers for the public services received a 3.4
pct pay rise from January 1. An agreement for four mln
engineering workers raised pay by 3.7 pct from April 1, and
then raises pay by another two pct from April 1, 1988 and by
2.5 pct from April 1, 1989. The engineering agreement also cuts
the working week by 1-1/2 hours to 37 hours in two stages.

Japan"s 1987 car export
restraint to the European Community (EC) is not enough, EC
external trade chief Willy de Clercq said.
    There are also strong signs Japanese exporters are
diverting cars to the EC after the dollar"s fall against the yen
made their U.S. Market unprofitable, he told reporters after
meeting U.S., Japanese, and Canadian trade ministers.
    The EC has agreed that if it detects an abnormal diversion
in Japanese exports from the U.S. To the EC market due to
currency movements over the past two years, it will move to
prevent it, he said.
    Over the period, the yen has risen against the dollar
almost eight times as fast as against the European Currency
Unit, he said.
    Japan has set an unofficial, voluntary 10 pct rise in car
exports to the EC this year as part of its efforts to stop its
rising trade surplus with the Community, which hit a record 18
billion dlrs last year.
    But Japanese car exports to the EC so far this year jumped
over 30 pct compared to a drop of 17 pct in U.S. Sales, and a
seven per cent fall globally. "We think there is some diversion
there," said de Clercq.
    Japanese officials say the overall annual rise will be only
10 pct.
    "But even 10 pct is 100,000 cars, whereas we sell only
40,000 cars to Japan (per year) in total," he said.
    The EC is also demanding that Japan ease its strict checks
and requirements for imported cars, which Brussels says is a
non-tariff barrier.
    The EC is also worried because EC demand for cars is
falling this year, making any rise in Japanese imports even
more serious for EC auto manufacturers.
    De Clercq, who has taken a hard line on world trade
problems at this weekend meeting in central Japan, said the EC
appreciated Japan"s plans to cut exports and lift domestic
growth instead.
    "But even if all these measures are implemented, it will
take time. But there is not time," he said.

President Reagan warned the U.S.
Congress in his weekly radio address against passing what he
called dangerous, protectionist trade legislation that would
tie his hands in trade negotiations with Japan and other
countries.
    Reagan, who will hold talks with Japanese Prime Minister
Yasuhiro Nakasone here this week, said he would lift tariffs
imposed last week against some Japanese products as soon as
Tokyo complied with a U.S.-Japanese pact on semiconductors.
    U.S. Officials gave the same message to former Japanese
Foreign Minister Shintaro Abe in meetings in Washington last
week.
    In his weekly radio address on Saturday, Reagan said he
would tell Nakasone: "We want to continue to work cooperatively
on trade problems and want very much to lift these trade
restrictions as soon as evidence permits.
    Reagan said the 100 pct tariffs he imposed on some 300 mln
dlrs worth of Japanese goods was a special case of trade
retaliation and did not signal a shift in what he called his
staunch anti-protectionist policies.
    "In imposing these tariffs we were just trying to deal with
a particular problem, not begin a trade war," he said.
    But Congress is ready to approve tough trade legislation to
try to turn round the record U.S. Trade deficit, which has cost
millions of U.S. Jobs and closed thousands of factories.
    A vote on a trade bill sponsored by Congressman Richard
Gephardt is expected to come during Nakasone"s visit. It would
penalise nations with large trade surpluses and which are
alleged to use unfair trade practices.
    Reagan warned Congress that such action would undercut his
ability to negotiate on trade issues with Nakasone and others.
    "With my meeting with Prime Minister Nakasone and the Venice
economic summit coming up, it"s terribly important not to
restrict a president"s options in such trade dealings with
foreign governments," he said.
    "Unfortunately, some in the Congress are trying to do
exactly that," he said.
    Reagan said he would keep the American people "informed on
this dangerous legislation because it"s just another form of
protectionism and I may need your help to stop it."

The Reagan Administration is
considering tax incentives to boost oil output and restore
100,000 jobs, U.S. Energy Secretary John Herrington said.
    A tax credit for new exploration would be part of a package
to bring 1,000 idle drilling rigs back into operation and raise
domestic production by one mln barrels a day, he said.
    The tax status of exploration might also be changed,
Herrington told reporters at the World Petroleum Congress.
    He said the oil industry was experiencing difficult times
internationally and had been devastated in the United States.
    Consumer demand and a significant decline in domestic
production has resulted in a rise in oil imports of one mln
barrels a day in over the last 16 months, Herrington said.
    "Steps must be taken...To reverse the downturn in our
domestic energy industry and to safeguard and increase our
energy security," he said.
    The administration is committed to improving marketplace
conditions and incentives to spur exploration and development.
    "This commitment includes rejecting quick fix solutions,
like an oil import fee, which are bad for the United States and
bad for the world," he added.

The Bundesbank urged the West German
government not to relax efforts to rein in spending when taxes
are cut in a 1990 fiscal reform package, saying that higher
expenditure could lead to a dangerous rise in interest rates.
    The Bundesbank's 1986 annual report said the government's
choice of measures to compensate for any cut in tax income was
a key political task. "There will also be consequences for the
state's attitude on spending," it said.
    It added that, while tax cuts should have a stimulatory
effect on the economy, the government should not expect any
significant increase in tax income in the short-term.
    The reform will cut taxes by a gross 44 billion marks, of
which 19 billion marks will be financed through as yet
unspecified measures.
    The Bundesbank noted that reducing tax preferences and
financial grants as well as raising some indirect taxes were
being considered.
    "As experience shows that a tax cut is not self-financing
... The question remains of how the rest of the tax cuts will
be financed," the Bundesbank said.
    The Bundesbank noted that in 1986, spending had increased
by more than the three pct annual average rise for 1982 to
1986. If this three pct limit were exceeded over a long period,
there would be a danger that increased new borrowing would be
necessary to finance deficits.
    It added that interest rates in West Germany were now low,
partly because of a high influx of foreign funds. But the
situation would become more difficult if the government's
credit requirements increased massively. "The anticipated
stimulatory effects on the economy from the tax cuts could be
thrown into jeopardy by higher interest rates," it said.

Germany's current account and trade
surpluses should narrow sharply in 1987 but they will take a
long time to get back to normal levels, the Bundesbank said in
its 1986 yearly report.
    The procedure would be slow as an abrupt turnaround in
external factors such as oil prices and exchange rates was not
expected. It did not specify what levels it considered normal.
    West Germany posted a record trade surplus of 124 billion
marks in 1986, after 86 billion in 1985 and its current account
surplus widened to 76.50 billion from 44.6 billion.
    Signs imports would continue to rise, a factor already
noted at the start of 1986, while exports rose only slightly,
would lead to a smaller trade surplus, the Bundesbank said.
    In real terms, West German imports rose 5.7 pct in 1986
while exports only increased by 0.8 pct.
    Germany's current account surplus widened to a provisional
6.6 billion in February from 4.8 billion in January but was
down from 6.85 billion posted in February 1986.
    The trade surplus in February widened to a provisional 10.4
billion marks from 7.2 billion in January and was still above
the 6.84 billion reached in the same month the year before.

Central bank money stock was growing
at about seven pct in the first quarter of 1987, down from
9-1/2 pct in the second half of 1986, so there are signs that
the pace of growth is slowing even though it is still above
target, the Bundesbank said in its 1986 annual report.
    The Bundesbank set a target range of three to six pct
growth from fourth quarter 1986 to fourth quarter 1987 for
central bank money stock. In the previous year it grew 7.7 pct,
outside the 3-1/2 to 5-1/2 pct target range.
    The Bundesbank noted that monetary policy in 1986 was
limited by a series of external factors.
    These included the revaluation of the mark, growing foreign
payments surpluses of non-banks, and currency inflows.
    The Bundesbank therefore tolerated the monetary overshoot
in 1986, as an attempt to counter monetary expansion with
interest rate and liquidity moves would have increased upward
pressure on the mark, it said.
    The lower end of the 1987 target range would be realistic
if a large part of funds currently held in a liquid form were
invested in long-term bank accounts or bonds, public bonds or
foreign securities, the Bundesbank said.
    But if companies and private households continue to hold
their funds in liquid forms, or if there are further currency
inflows, growth will be closer to the upper end of the range.
    "The more the conflict between external constraints and
domestic objectives relaxes -- and many things point to this at
the time of writing this report -- the more possible it will be
to do justice again to the medium-term concept of money supply
control," the Bundesbank said.
    It noted that prices were beginning to tend upwards again
at the start of 1987.
    There would be virtually no easing of other production
costs in 1987 to compensate for the rise in unit-wage costs.
    "Nevertheless, no inflationary trends are likely to set in
this year," the Bundesbank said.
    A link between excessive monetary growth and intensifying
price rises can only be observed in the long term, it added.
    The continuing trend for non-banks to switch into long-term
borrowing to take advantage of low interest rates, while for
the same reason shunning long-term investments, increases the
risks in changing interest rates for banks refinancing
themselves with variable-interest deposits, it added.

Attempts to hold currency rates
rigidly within tight ranges through European Monetary System
intramarginal intervention can be counterproductive, bringing
funds into the stronger currency from the weaker at rates still
considered fairly favourable, the Bundesbank said.
    "The movements thus sparked can actually promote the weaker
tendency of a currency, requiring still larger obligatory
intervention when rates hit band limits," it said in its 1986
annual report. The other danger was that money supply expansion
could be caused in the stronger currency nation without its
central bank being involved in the activity.
    "For this reason, currency levels should be allowed as much
room for manoeuvre as possible inside the band limits when a
currency is in a phase of weakness," the Bundesbank said.
    "In addition, speculative positions are made more expensive
to hold when interest differentials are increased."
    In the report, the Bundesbank gave a rare glimpse of the
extent of intramarginal and obligatory EMS intervention that
has taken place since the foundation of the eight-currency
system on March 13, 1979.
    Obligatory intervention is that required by EMS central
banks when a currency reaches its agreed limit against another
participating unit.
    Intramarginal intervention is undertaken on agreement
between central banks when speculative pressure moves a
currency in an unwanted direction, although it may not yet be
near any allowed EMS limits.
    At the start of this year, central banks were very actively
selling marks and supporting weaker currencies, primarily the
French franc, as speculative EMS pressure grew.
    But the announcement by the Bank of France that it was
ceasing intramarginal intervention sent the franc straight to
its then-permitted floor of 31.8850 marks per 100.
    Data in the Bundesbank report showed the EMS central banks
bought a net total 29.9 billion marks after the April 6, 1986
realignment until the selling petered out on July 7.
    But this was far outweighed by net purchases between July
8, 1986, and the realignment on January 12 this year totalling
63.0 billion marks - 44.1 billion of which was intramarginal
and 18.9 billion was obligatory intervention.
    The data showed that 17.4 billion marks of the total
eventually filtered into the West German monetary system.
    Since the latest realignment, central banks have bought
16.1 billion marks in intramarginal intervention, the
Bundesbank said, without naming the banks involved.
    Only very high activity after the March 21, 1983
realignment came close to matching moves up to last January.
Then, central banks bought a massive 61.6 billion marks in the
period up to July 1985, mainly to stabilise the EMS as the
dollar surged.
    This then turned into mark sales of a net 34.0 billion from
July 11, 1985 in the run-up to the April 1986 realignment.

Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa opened the 20th annual meeting of the Asian
Development Bank by holding out the promise of more Japanese
money for the organisation.
    "We are ... Striving to enhance the flow of capital from
Japan to the developing countries," he said.
    "The Asia-Pacific region is an area of special concern for
us in our bilateral and multilateral assistance."
    He said Tokyo was ready to study setting up a special
Japanese fund at the ADB, like the one at the World Bank.
    The World Bank fund is earmarked for use by developing
countries.
    Developing countries and the United States have criticised
Japan for failing to use its trade surplus to help poor
countries.
    Later this week, Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone is
expected to tell President Reagan that Japan plans to extend as
much as 30 billion dlrs to developing countries over the next
three years, Japanese officials said. The exta ADB funding
would be part of that amount.
    "Our cooperation is intended to contibute to ... Alleviating
the burden on (developing countries)," said Miyazawa, who is
also chairman of the ADB board of governors.
    "The developing countries today find themselves in a very
difficult situation," he said. "With a few notable exceptions,
those countries that are highly dependent upon commodity
exports face a rough road ahead."
    While the developing countries can help themselves by
striving to become internationally competitive and seeking to
attract foreign investment, the ADB also has a role to play, he
said.
    Miyazawa told the meeting the bank must beef up its
economic advice program to developing nations and must work
vigorously to identify development projects for loans.
    He also called for more use of loans that were not tied to
development projects, but provided more overall help to the
borrower.
    ADB President Masao Fujioka supported Miyazawa's view.
    "The bank has been fondly described as the family doctor,"
Fujioka said. "The bank will now have to equip itself to meet a
range of services required to attend to varied needs of its
developing members."
    Miyazawa told the meeting Tokyo was ready to allow its
Export-Import Bank to co-finance ADB loans. These would not
have to be used for the purchase of Japanese equipment.
    Tokyo was also prepared to let the Asian Development Bank
raise more funds in Tokyo and financial markets should it need

Japan's 1987 car export
restraint to the European Community (EC) is not enough, EC
external trade chief Willy de Clercq said.
    There are also strong signs Japanese exporters are
diverting cars to the EC after the dollar's fall against the
yen made their U.S. market unprofitable, he told reporters
after meeting U.S., Japanese, and Canadian trade ministers.
    The EC has agreed that if it detects an abnormal diversion
in Japanese exports from the U.S. To the EC market due to
currency movements over the past two years, it will move to
prevent it, he said.
    Over the period, the yen has risen against the dollar
almost eight times as fast as against the European Currency
Unit, he said.
    Japan has set an unofficial, voluntary 10 pct rise in car
exports to the EC this year as part of its efforts to stop its
rising trade surplus with the Community, which hit a record 18
billion dlrs last year.
    But Japanese car exports to the EC so far this year jumped
over 30 pct compared to a drop of 17 pct in U.S. Sales, and a
seven per cent fall globally. "We think there is some diversion
there," said de Clercq.

Senior officials from the Group of
Seven (G-7) countries will meet next week to decide an agenda
for the body's June summit scheduled to be held in Venice,
Japanese officials said.
    The meeting will provide senior government officials with
their first chance to discuss the recent sharp drop of the
dollar, although the main focus of the gathering is longer
term, they said.
    Deputy Finance Ministers, including Japanese Vice-Finance
Minister Toyoo Gyohten, will attend. The meeting will be held
in Italy, they said, but gave no other details.
    The leaders of the G-7, the United States, Britain, Canada,
France, Italy, Japan and West Germany, are expected to discuss
ways of improving economic policy coordination in Venice.
    The hope is that increased coordination will help reduce
the huge imbalances in world trade and calm volatile currency
markets. But economists say the strategy has so far not worked.
    Japanese officials admitted there is little more they can
do on their own to stem the dollar decline, which last week saw
the currency plunge to a post-war low below 140 yen.
    The officials said they expected sentiment against the
dollar to change soon, once the U.S. Trade deficit starts to
fall and the Japanese surplus begins to shrink.
    "We have already seen some signs of improvement (in the
trade picture), but the market does not appreciate it yet," one
said.
    Last week's passage of the Japanese government budget by
parliament's Lower House also paves the way for Tokyo to take
additional action to stimulate its sagging economy and boost
imports, the officials said.

The Reagan Administration is
considering tax incentives to boost oil output and restore
100,000 jobs, U.S. Energy Secretary John Herrington said.
    A tax credit for new exploration would be part of a package
to bring 1,000 idle drilling rigs back into operation and raise
domestic production by one mln barrels a day, he said.
    The tax status of exploration might also be changed,
Herrington told reporters at the World Petroleum Congress.
    He said the oil industry was experiencing difficult times
internationally and had been devastated in the United States.
    Consumer demand and a significant decline in domestic
production has resulted in a rise in oil imports of one mln
barrels a day in over the last 16 months, Herrington said.
    "Steps must be taken...To reverse the downturn in our
domestic energy industry and to safeguard and increase our
energy security," he said.
    The administration is committed to improving marketplace
conditions and incentives to spur exploration and development.
    "This commitment includes rejecting quick fix solutions,
like an oil import fee, which are bad for the United States and
bad for the world," he added.

Attempts to hold currency rates
rigidly within tight ranges through European Monetary System
intramarginal intervention can be counterproductive, bringing
funds into the stronger currency from the weaker at rates still
considered fairly favourable, the Bundesbank said.
    "The movements thus sparked can actually promote the weaker
tendency of a currency, requiring still larger obligatory
intervention when rates hit band limits," it said in its 1986
annual report. The other danger was that money supply expansion
could be caused in the stronger currency nation without its
central bank being involved in the activity.

    "For this reason, currency levels should be allowed as much
room for manoeuvre as possible inside the band limits when a
currency is in a phase of weakness," the Bundesbank said.
    "In addition, speculative positions are made more expensive
to hold when interest differentials are increased."
    In the report, the Bundesbank gave a rare glimpse of the
extent of intramarginal and obligatory EMS intervention that
has taken place since the foundation of the eight-currency
system on March 13, 1979.

    Obligatory intervention is that required by EMS central
banks when a currency reaches its agreed limit against another
participating unit.
    Intramarginal intervention is undertaken on agreement
between central banks when speculative pressure moves a
currency in an unwanted direction, although it may not yet be
near any allowed EMS limits.
    At the start of this year, central banks were very actively
selling marks and supporting weaker currencies, primarily the
French franc, as speculative EMS pressure grew.

    But the announcement by the Bank of France that it was
ceasing intramarginal intervention sent the franc straight to
its then-permitted floor of 31.8850 marks per 100.
    Data in the Bundesbank report showed the EMS central banks
bought a net total 29.9 billion marks after the April 6, 1986
realignment until the selling petered out on July 7.
    But this was far outweighed by net purchases between July
8, 1986, and the realignment on January 12 this year totalling
63.0 billion marks - 44.1 billion of which was intramarginal
and 18.9 billion was obligatory intervention.

    The data showed that 17.4 billion marks of the total
eventually filtered into the West German monetary system.
    Since the latest realignment, central banks have bought
16.1 billion marks in intramarginal intervention, the
Bundesbank said, without naming the banks involved.
    Only very high activity after the March 21, 1983
realignment came close to matching moves up to last January.
Then, central banks bought a massive 61.6 billion marks in the
period up to July 1985, mainly to stabilise the EMS as the
dollar surged.
    This then turned into mark sales of a net 34.0 billion from
July 11, 1985 in the run-up to the April 1986 realignment.

Four trade ministers ended a
weekend meeting with a frank confession that their governments
are losing credibility in world financial markets and will not
regain it until they back their promises over trade and
currencies with action.
    "Until today we have anounced policies, but when it came to
action required it was done in a way that satisfied nobody,"
Japanese Trade Minister Hajime Tamura told a news conference.
    "From now on, if a government comes up with a certain
policy, it must be followed by action," he said following two
days of informal talks with the trade ministers of the United
States, the European Community and Canada in central Japan.
    Last week, the dollar fell to a new record low below 140
yen, despite statements from the Group of Seven (G-7) leading
industrial powers that currencies should be stabilised to
underpin world trade.
    "We need credibility to gain confidence. When we have
confidence, then we can have an impact," said Tamura.
    His colleagues agreed that when major trade nations fought
over trade issues while calling for each other to honour free
trade rules in general, it was not a sight which inspired
confidence in the markets.
    "The time has come now to act in step with the talk. If you
belong to a club, you have to act in concord with the rules, if
you want to be credible," said EC external trade chief Willy de
Clercq.
    Pat Carney of Canada said "We are meeting in a time of great
trade tension. What the world needs to see is that we have the
political will to deal with these problems we face."
    She said that next month's meeting of the Organisation of
Economic Cooperation and Development and the meeting of leaders
of the G-7 nations in Venice in the summer would be a forum to
show this will existed.
    U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter reminded the news
conference that the results of such high level meetings could
lead to action which would only have an effect on smoothing out
world trade imbalances perhaps years later.
    "The media typically has a tendency to evaluate meetings
like this in terms of tangible results. That is not the way it
should be pursued," he said.
    "What is achieved in an intangible way almost always exceeds
what is achieved in a tangible way," he said.
    Progress in personal contacts and understanding each
others' positions and policies was just as important toward
reducing trade tensions, he said.
    Tamura read out an agreed summary of the joint talks:
    Currency stability was now essential, but currency
movements alone would not correct a U.S. trade deficit with
Japan which hit 58 billion dlrs last year, an 18 billion dlr EC
deficit with Japan in 1986, and a Japanese global trade surplus
of almost 90 billion, he said.
    Trade retaliation, protectionism, and forcible export
restraints which lead to a shrinkage in world trade flows were
most dangerous, he said.
    The imbalances can only be solved by coordinated policies
over a whole range of fiscal, monetary, trade and industrial
measures, and in line with a body of internationally agreed
rules, he said.
    In this regard, the policing role of the Geneva-based
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade world trade body must be
strengthened, he said.
    The ministers reconfirmed their individual promises to
solve the problem. The United States will try to reduce its
large budget deficit and restore competitiveness within its
industries.
    Japan will introduce early and effective measures to expand
its domestic growth and rely less on exports.
    The EC must continue efforts for balanced growth and
reduced unemployment. All felt satisfied at the new progress in
the Canadian economy.

The Zeebrugge ferry disaster, in which
around 200 people drowned seven weeks ago, was almost certainly
caused by the ship leaving port with its bow doors wide open, a
British government inquiry was told.
    Lawyer David Steel, representing the government, told the
opening session of a public inquiry into the March 6 tragedy
that this was "the only tenable explanation."
    The ferry, the Herald of Free Enterprise, is owned by
Townsend Thoresen, part of P and O's <PORL.L> subsidiary
European Ferries Group.
    Steel, commissioner of wrecks for England and Wales, said
the inquiry would probably conclude that the ferry capsized in
calm seas and fair weather a mile outside the Belgian port when
water poured into the car deck.
    "We think you will also conclude that the immediate cause of
that was that the doors were open, he said.
    Steel told the tribunal it appeared no attempt was made to
close either the inner or outer bow doors prior to what should
have been a routine voyage to the English port of Dover,
despite a provision in the ship's "Stability Booklet" that the
doors were to be closed and kept closed.

A leading regional banker said
that it was axiomatic that despite market intervention, a
country's currency will eventually fall to an exchange rate
which balances its international trade and payments accounts.
    John Medlin, president and chief executive officer for the
First Wachovia Corp, said that "substantial and rapid currency
devaluations usually are followed in time by surging price
inflation, spiralling interest rates and painful economic
austerity."
    Speaking to a banking trade group, he also said the peak of
debt writeoff has not yet been reached.
    Medlin told the Bankers Association for Foreign Trade that
ultimately "our nation's budget and trade deficits will be
balanced either through voluntary restraints in spending and
consumption or through forced austerity imposed by a
dispassionate and unmerciful international market place."
    He said the continuing weakness of the dollar and the
recent increase in inflation and interest rates "provide early
warning that the classic laws of international economics still
are in effect."
    He also told the association that trying to reduce the
trade deficit by erecting protectionist barriers to imports
would not give lasting relief.
    "However, the imposition and enforcement of fair trade
rules could help improve imbalances with nations which practice
protectionism and deception on us."
    Medlin noted that the U.S. economy was likely to continue
"at best being a sluggish mixture of depressed segments and
growth areas."
    But he said that the business cycle was still alive and
that the next downturn "could be deeper and harder to reverse
than the last one."

Pressure is growing in the financial
markets for the U.S. to take overt action to stabilize the
dollar even though doubts linger that it has fallen far enough
to help redress world trade imbalances, economists and dealers
said.
    Some experts believe that a half-point increase in the U.S.
discount rate, preferably in conjunction with rate cuts in
Tokyo and Bonn, would be enough to discourage sellers.
    But many fear that more drastic action, such as a U.S.
issue of yen-denominated Treasury bonds, may be needed.
    Despite official warnings about the dangers of a further
dollar decline and concerted central bank intervention, the
dollar extended its recent sharp depreciation, touching a
40-year low of 137.25 yen in Tokyo earlier today after closing
here on Friday at 139.30/40.
    The impact on other financial markets was devastating.
    In Tokyo, the stock market suffered its largest single day
decline; in London, gold bullion prices rose to four-year highs
and in the U.S., long Treasury bond yields surged above 8.80
pct and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 40
points in hectic early trading.
    "The problem now is linkage. This is not just a currency
problem. It is affecting all the markets," said one senior
trader at a major U.S. bank.
    Up until September of last year, international efforts to
redress world trade imbalances appeared to working like a
dream; the dollar was falling in an orderly manner, world
interest rates were tumbling and inflation was kept in check.
    In recent months, however, this strategy has begun to show
signs of severe stress, with the U.S. imposition of punitive
tariffs on Japan threatening to unravel this spirit of
cooperating and condemn the world to a damaging trade war.
    "The markets fear that we have built up a momentum that is
really difficult to stop. A U.S. rate hike has become an
inevitability," one currency dealer said.
    "At this point, nothing short of a Fed discount rate
increase, ideally combined with further discount rate cuts by
Japan and Germany, would seem capable of stabilizing the
dollar," said David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston and Co Inc.
    Allen Sinai of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc predicted a 1/4
to 1/2 point U.S. rate increase before May 19 and a rise in
U.S. bank prime lending rates to eight pct from 7-3/4 pct in
the near future.
    But many economists feared that any moderate U.S. rate
increases, which appear unlikely to be matched by rate cuts
overseas, would be too little, too late.
    "They should have done this 10 days ago. It would have done
the trick then," said one currency analyst.
    "If they do it now, it would be seen as a defensive measure
not an offensive one. It would show policy weakness not
strength," added one trader.
    In addition, economists fear that a discount rate rise
might place additional strain on a sluggish U.S. economy and
tempt embattled debtor nations to retaliate.
    A U.S. discount rate increase would also fuel the
protectionist fires in Washington, where the House is expected
to pass a protectionist trade bill, whatever compromises
President Reagan and Prime Minister Nakasone can come up with
during their summit later in the week.
    "Politically, they can't really do it this week," said one
currency analyst, pointing out that if it failed to stabilize
the dollar, it would only weaken the U.S. negotiating stance.
    Even if the U.S. retains the upper hand, economists and
traders do not hold out high hopes for any major new
initiatives from this week's talks.
    At best, the experts see some sort of accord whereby Japan
will agree to stimulate growth and open its domestic markets to
outsiders while the U.S. promises to lift its tariffs and
support the Group of Seven dollar stabilization agreement.
    But many fear that this may not be enough to assuage the
market's speculative selling fervor, which has now raised fears
of weak overseas interest at next week's quarterly U.S.
Treasury refunding program.
    Japanese and European investors have traditionally played
an active role in these auctions, which are expected to total
28 to 29 billion dlrs.
    Consequently, thoughts are turning to the possibility that
President Reagan may try to remove foreign investors' worries
about currency risk by financing part of the U.S. budget
deficit in yen or mark bonds, rather than dollars.
    While similar action by former President Carter helped to
stabilize the dollar in 1978, the White House is clearly
reluctant to take such a step, economists said.
    This hesitance was amply shown last Friday when U.S.
Treasury Secretary James Baker said, "there might well be some
who would view (yen-denominated bonds) as a lack of confidence
by the U.S. in its own currency."
    Baker added, "therefore we don't think it's an appropriate
thing to do."
    A foreign exchange analyst at a major Japanese bank here
shared Baker's doubts. "Dollar defending measures are very
unlikely. They will confirm the dollar's weak undertone and
lead to further speculative dollar selling," he said.
    Thus, it may be less destabilizing for the authorities to
stop trying to fight the market's bearish sentiment.
    In a recent lengthy report, economists at Morgan Guaranty
Trust Co concluded, "the dollar should be left free to trade at
whatever level market forces produce."

Du Pont Co, reporting lower
first quarter profits, said a drop in energy earnings was only
partially offset by surging chemical and specialty products.
    Du Pont earned 391 mln dlrs, or 1.62 dlrs a share, in the
latest quarter, down from 404 mln, or 1.67 dlrs a share, in
1986's initial quarter.
    It had sales of 7.13 billion dlrs, down from 7.17 billion
last year and total revenues of 7.20 billion dlrs down from
7.29 billion dlrs.
    Du Pont said after-tax operating income for its chemical
and specialty products businesses totaled 393 mln dlrs in the
latest quarter, rising 55 pct from last year's first quarter
due to improved results from most businesses, notably fibers,
white pigments and specialty polymers.
    Results benefited from improved worldwide demand and lower
costs attributable to lower energy feedstock prices, earlier
restructurings, and efforts to improve productivity.
    It said sales of these businesses were up eight pct to 4.2
billion dlrs on a sales volume increase of five pct and three
pct higher average prices, reflecting a weaker dollar.
    Du Pont said after-tax operating income from the petroleum
segments dropped 64 pct from a year ago to 55 mln dlrs in the
latest quarter.
    These results reflect lower refined petroleum product
margins and lower worldwide crude oil and domestic natural gas
prices. Coal earnings were down 27 pct on lower prices.
    The company said it anticipates continued strong results
from chemicals and specialty products as worldwide demand
remains high. Improvement in petroleum will require flat or
improved crude oil prices and improved refined product margins.

Exxon Corp chairman Lawrence Rawl said
total world energy consumption will continue to grow, but added
new oil discoveries worldwide are slowing down and can not
offset annual production.
    In a speech at the World Petroleum Congress here, Rawl said
oil companies would increasingly be forced to turn to enhanced
recovery techniques, very heavy oil and synthetics to
compensate for substantial declines in conventional oil
production.
    "What our current outlook suggests is that total world
energy consumption will continue to grow steadily in an ever
more energy efficient world," Rawl said. But, he added, Exxon
projects that "despite today's ample supplies, the world will
also be facing up to inherent limitations on the availability
of oil and gas, which currently supplies more than half of the
world's energy needs."
    The Exxon chairman told some 1,500 oil executives from
around the world that some synthetics projects could become
practical when oil reaches 30 dlrs to 40 dlrs a barrel range in
real terms.
    "The question is when and how this will happen," he said.
"I believe that synthetic projects will not only re-emerge but
will become commercial well below those we were thinking about
the last time oil prices moved substantially higher."
    Rawl said synthetic fuel would become economic at lower
prices because companies are investigating "a new generation of
ideas that promise substantially lower costs" and projects
begun in the late 1970s, which have since been suspended.
    Rawl also said companies must find new and more effective
ways of enhanced recovery from existing oil fields.
    "It would be my view that new oil discoveries, even with
advanced technology, are likely to slow down - not reverse -
the decline in worldwide oil discoveries," he said. "So it is
essential to find a better way to recover more of the
discovered oil from producing fields using chemicals, solvents,
heat, and other techniques."
    Rawl emphasized that private oil companies need some
assistance from government in developing synfuels technology.
"More importantly, they need to provide a political and
economic environment that is stable enough to allow the
developmental process to function effectively, he said.
    Rawl also said stable energy markets serve the best
interest of producing and consuming nations by allowing both
groups to plan for steady economic growth.
    He did not make any oil price prediction, saying only that
the economic goals of the U.S. and other nations can only be
achieved if world oil prices "stabilize within a reasonable
range."
    "Prices must be high enough to meet realistic aspirations
for income and encourage resource development in the producing
countries, but not so high as to inhibit economic growth in

Corp expects its new products and cost-cutting measures to have
an increasingly positive impact as 1987 proceeds, chairman John
Akers told the annual meeting.
    Akers repeated his assessment of the company's outlook when
first quarter results were announced last week that "although
the worldwide economic situation remains unsettled, we see some
encouraging signs."
    He said IBM shipments in the first quarter exceeded the
1986 level, "the first time that has happened since 1985."
    Akers said that IBM will increase its emphasis on service
and support of customers this year and that by the end of 1987
it will have 20 pct more sales representatives and systems
engineers than two years ago.
    He said the company is accomplishing this by both moving as
many existing employees as possible into marketing and through
new hires.
    Akers said IBM will increase its U.S. software programming
workforce, both through retraining and hiring, by nearly six
thousands people over early 1985, to a yearend total of 26,000.
    Last year IBM announced that it would try to reduce its
workforce without violating its historical no-layoff policy
through early-retirement offers and retraining.
    Earlier this month, the company introduced a new line of
personal computers and this summer it will begin shipping a new
generation of minicomputers it hopes will compete successfully
against offerings from Digital Equipment Corp <DEC>.
    Akers said, "We expect our product announcements and
resource-balancing measures to have an increasingly positive
impact as 1987 proceeds."
    Akers said that since last April the company's worldwide
workforce has been reduced by 11,000.
    He said some 14,000 people have been moved from one IBM
location to another, headquarters staff positions were cut by
7,000 and the number of U.S. managers has been cut by 1,500.
    Akers said IBM is "working hard to reduce our product
cycle," which is the time between the cenception of a new
product and its first shipment.
    "We want to make this as short as possible and we are
making progress," he said.

said he wants the Senate to pass by late Friday a fiscal 1988
budget that starts reducing the flow of U.S. debt.
    The Democratic leader told a news conference and later the
Senate itself that the Senate would debate the measure today
even though technically the first procedural vote --on formally
bringing up the vital measure for action--would not take place
until tomorrow afternoon.
    The pending budget would cut some 38 billion dlrs from an

billion dlrs, through cuts in defence and social spending and
some 18.5 billion dlrs in unspecified tax hikes in 1988.

level)."

     Unlike Norway, which has restricted its production of
North Sea oil by 80,000 barrels a day in an effort to stabilize
world oil prices, Britain has consistently refused to intervene

The prospect of renewed assaults on
the dollar might force the United States eventually to unveil
distasteful measures to bolster support for its currency,
monetary analysts and economists said.
    Treasury Secretary James Baker has acknowledged that the
Reagan administration discussed the possibility of issuing
yen-denominated U.S. government bonds to support the dollar.
    But he has also dismissed speculation that he was ready to
take such an unusual step. Nonetheless, monetary sources say
the issue has been seriously discussed by the administration.
    "It is unlikely that we would undertake to do that now,"
Baker said last week. "In our view there might well be some who
would view (issuing U.S. yen bonds) as, in fact, a lack of
confidence by the U.S. in its own currency. And therefore we
don't think it's an appropriate thing to do."
    But if the Reagan administration did announce measures,
they could be a part of an internationally-coordinated effort
to end the instability in financial markets with genuine action
to reduce massive economic imbalances, monetary analysts
believe.
    And, like a currency defense package unveiled by the Carter
administration, issuing yen bonds could be accompanied by a
rise in the discount rate, now 5.5 pct.
    The Federal Reserve has resisted pressure to raise this key
rate so far, chiefly, some Fed officials say, because it could
hurt economic growth. Another concern is the fragile
international debt situation.
    Analysts who expect a currency support package are divided
over its possible timing. Some even believe an announcement
could come this week during a visit to Washington by Japanese
Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone.
    "It would give some real focus to the visit, and it might
steady the dollar and prevent it from going down," said Charles
Taylor, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities.
    But monetary sources said they thought it unlikely that the
Reagan administration would resort to measures which would
bring to mind the troubles of President Carter.
    Until very recently, the current administration has urged a
lower dollar to help redress its huge trade deficit while
Carter faced a weak dollar as confidence in his economic
policies collapsed. But today, Washington's policies are
increasingly in question.
    The Carter plan was unleashed on Nov. 1, 1978. And it was a
resounding success. "This package really gave credibility to the
administration to get the dollar up," said Robert Hormats,
vice-president of Goldman Sachs Inc and a former senior U.S.
economic in the Carter and Reagan Administrations.
    The dollar then stood at just under 1.87 marks and around
188 yen. Today it stands around 1.79 marks and 139 yen.
    "The problem is now that the administration in rhetoric is
evidencing concern about the dollar but in practice is really
doing very little," Hormats said of statements to support the
dollar by U.S. officials.
    Several currency traders and foreign central bank officials
think these statements still fall short of unequivocally saying
the dollar has declined far enough.
    Carter issued 6.4 billion dlrs of mark and swiss franc
bonds aimed essentially at buttressing pyschological support
for the dollar but also at attracting foreign investors, who
had lost confidence in the dollar, to U.S. government notes.
    The package was supported by a one pct rise in the discount
rate, to 9.5 pct, drawings on U.S. monetary reserves at the
International Monetary Fund and sales of U.S.-held SDRS to
other IMF members. 
    It was also supported by increased Fed currency swap lines
with other central banks and stepped up official U.S. gold
sales.
    Stephen Axilrod, a former Fed official who is now
vice-chairman of Nikko Securities, said, "I think it's very
unlikely they would do that now."
    He argued that it was politically difficult to take action
to support the dollar while Japan and West Germany have still
to fulfill pledges to stimulate their economies.
    But most analysts believe a currency support package would
only work if genuine economic measures to redress world trade
imbalances are undertaken by the leading industrial powers.
    It could coincide with the June Venice summit of leaders of
the seven major industrial democracies -- the United States,
Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada.
    Hormats said he believed the currency has to decline
slightly further for a package to have impact. He said the
seven nations' Paris Accord to stabilize currencies was forged
too soon to fundamentally change market sentiment.
    "I think we're nearing a point when they would feel
(politically) comfortable doing this," Hormats said.
    Many analysts think the administration's reluctance to act
firmly on the dollar has been due to its desire to keep up the
pressure on its allies to bolster their economies and for fear
of fanning protectionist sentiment in Congress.
    But Hormats said "there will be a point at which the
government of the United States shows it does give a damn for
the dollar."

The offshore oil drilling industry
will attract increasing numbers of government connected firms
in the 1990s, according to Ronald Tappmeyer, Vice Chairman of
Reading and Bates Drilling Co.
     Tappmeyer told the Offshore Technology Conference that
contract drilling was reaching the same kind of situation that
oil producing companies reached when their oilfields were
nationalized in nations as Venezuela, Iran and Saudi Arabia.
     He said local connections to the nation whose waters are
being drilled was an increasingly important factor in the
market.
     "We have seen contractors put at competitive disadvantages
in nations in which they had worked successfully for years
essentially moved aside to make room for locally-owned firms or
a locally-built rig," he said.
     Tappmeyer, who is president of the International
Association of Drilling Contractors, said how far the trend
would spread depends on the growth of trade protectionism.
     He added that international contractors will increasingly
find their role restricted to regions that require special
expertise and experience, such as wildcat areas and severe
environments such as in the Arctic and extremely deep waters.
     Tappmeyer also said he expects producing companies to
provide the main financing for offshore drilling in the coming
decade as banks will be unwilling to repeat overexposing
themselves and drilling contractors will have difficulty
providing financing out of cash flow.
     At the same time, he said he saw the financing as indirect
as he does not see producers getting back in the rig-owning
business.
     He also said projectfinancing will have to be backed up
by work commitments to guarantee the payoff of construction
costs.
     For the time being, he said there was a superabundance of
rigs. But he said there will be a need for new, technologically
advanced rigs within a few years.
     He said the floating-drilling rigs were most likely to
benefit from new developments in technology, adding that by
2,000 there should not be an ocean left that is too deep, too
cold, too stormy or too remote to be explored.

Currency futures at the International
Monetary Market (IMM) are likely to consolidate near current
levels in nervous trading conditions over the next few days,
although underlying sentiment remains positive, currency
analysts said.
    "Currencies are likely to muddle around these levels," said
Shearson Lehman Brothers analyst Anne Parker Mills.
    Traders are unwilling to establish either long or short
positions in futures because of uncertainty over upcoming trade
talks and U.S. trade legislation, they said.
    Japanese prime minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and President
Reagan will meet Thursday and Friday to discuss trade tensions
between their two countries, while at the same time the
Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives will be voting on
a controversial trade bill.
    "Unless something really surprising comes out of the
Nakasone/Reagan talks, I don't see the dollar getting above 142
(yen) and 1.83 (marks)," Mills said.
    The equivalent in futures of those interbank levels are
about 0.007050 to 0.007025 in the June yen contract and about
0.5500 in June marks, she said.
    June yen closed at 0.007191 on Tuesday while June marks
finished the day at 0.5602.
    Mills said, however, that "the chances of them (Reagan and
Nakasone) coming up with something new are limited." One
possibility might be a Japanese discount rate cut, but "they
probably won't do that unless we raise our discount rate."
    Recent firmness in the federal funds rate and the Federal
Reserve's slowness in adding reserves to the banking system has
heightened sentiment that the money-policy making body has
already tightened credit and a discount rate hike is possible,
analysts said.
    Recent weakness in currencies and strength in the dollar
has been more the result of nervous shortcovering ahead of the
meeting rather than reaction to the White House statement
Monday supporting a stable dollar, said Harris bank currency
analyst Earl Johnson.
    Traders "are worried about the outcome of the talks between
Reagan and Nakasone," and as the talks are late in the week,
the market may not get a chance to react to any developments
until Monday, Johnson said.
    Until then, Johnson expects the dollar to remain in a broad
range between 1.77 and 1.85 marks and 137 to 140.50 yen.
    Chicago Corp analyst John Bilson, however, expects a rally
in the European currencies over the near-term, while the yen,
at this point is overbought.
    "The Japanese are moving away from the U.S. market," and
investment funds formerly directed to the U.S. are likely to
flow into Europe, Bilson said.
    The chief beneficiary of such a flow of funds will be
sterling, Bilson said.
    "Sterling rates are about four pct above Japanese rates,
despite the half point rate cut," Bilson said. Major U.K. banks
lowered their base lending rates today to 9.5 pct.
    In addition to a favorable interest rate spread which
should attract funds, Bilson said the firm oil market and the
strong political situation of Prime Minister Thatcher also make
British investments attractive.
    Passage of the trade bill, which includes an amendment by
Missouri Democrat Richard Gephardt that would force a 10 pct
annual cut in imports from countries with an excessive trade
surplus with the U.S. if they fail to remove unfair trade
barriers to the U.S. after six months of negatiations, would
likely pressure the yen, Bilson said.
    Bilson, however, said the legislation is unlikely to pass,
but that Nakasone is likely to bring a promise to open Japanese
markets to U.S. goods and back it up with government contracts
with U.S. manufacturers.

A study by the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development says it may take years
to resolve the huge economic imbalances now plaguing the world
economy, U.S. and western officials said.
    The paper was expected to stimulate policy debate among
senior officials of leading industrial nations preparing for
next month's annual meeting of finance ministers in Paris.
    The May 11-13 ministerial meeting of the 24-nation OECD, a
forum for coordinating economic policies, has taken on added
significance in view of the difficulties dogging the attempts
of major nations to achieve joint goals.
    Despite two meetings of the seven leading industrial powers
-- the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Britain,
Italy and Canada -- pledges to change policy have still to be
turned into action.
    As a result, financial markets have been unusually unstable
and have focussed their attention on every international
meeting for clues that change is in the air.
    The study concludes that there needs to be much greater
fiscal action by the United States, West Germany and Japan to
reduce their massive trade imbalances, a U.S. official said.
    "We looked at what we could do to get from here to there.
We've got to continue cutting the deficit, and there needs to
be domestic expansion (in West Germany and Japan)," the official
said, noting that significant actions are called for.
    Officials noted the study strongly underscores the need for
action by West Germany and Japan.
    Seperately, western officials said they understood that
U.S. overtures to Japan and West Germany to cut their
short-term interest rates have been rebuffed for now.
    Such rate reductions would have helped stabilize the steep
decline of the dollar, by widening the difference between bond
yields in the United States, on the one hand, and in Japan and
West Germany on the other.
    One official said that while the policy actions called for
were similar to those urged by the seven, the study shows "it's
going to take several years to resolve (the trade
imbalances)."
    The OECD has set three pct as the necessary target for
average annual growth in the industrial world if trade
imbalances are to be corrected and the Third World debt crisis
kept under control.
    The study strongly implies these targets will not be met
without major action by the three leading nations, officials
said.
    Equally, it suggests that without major fiscal expansion by
Bonn and Tokyo, and a corresponding deep reduction in the U.S.
budget deficit, the current trend of an upturn in U.S. interest
rates and a weakening dollar will go uncorrected.
    U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker says the dollar's deep
decline alone will shave only 15 billion dlrs off the roughly
140 billion dlrs U.S. deficit in goods and services this year.
    But the study group also found that progress has been made
and the seven main nations are moving in the right direction.
    In Paris this February, the seven agreed that fiscal
actions by the three major powers would help them stabilize
currencies around levels ruling then.
    The Reagan administration, this week facing the prospect of
a tough trade bill aimed at curbing foreign trade surpluses,
also promised to fight protectionism.
    The officials said Washington must move ahead with budget
deficit cuts of around 36 billion dlrs, a figure set as a goal
by the Democratic leadership of the House of Representatives.
    They also called for significant increases in the budget
deficits of Japan and West Germany. Since the study group met,
Japan has announced a roughly 35 billion dlr supplementary
budget which was warmly welcomed by Washington.
    Nonetheless there is caution over both the timing and the
content of the proposed Japanese budget.
    Financial markets, unconvinced by yet another Japanese
promise of action, have pushed the yen sharply higher against
the dollar.
    While no West German fiscal action is promised before
January 1988, U.S. officials would welcome such a move. "We'd
love them to accelerate their tax cuts," one official said.
    West German economic growth fell steeply in the first
quarter this year, but the official said Bonn has reassured
U.S. officials they expect growth to pick up again.
    If faster German growth fails to emerge, Bonn could find
itself under pressure to speed up tax cuts planned for early
1988 when leaders of the seven meet in Venice this June.

West Germany's current account
surplus widened to a provisional 8.8 billion marks in March
from a slightly downwards revised 6.5 billion in February, a
spokesman for the Federal Statistics Office said.
    The trade surplus fell to a provisional 10.1 billion marks
from 10.4 billion in February.
    The Statistics Office had earlier put the February current
account surplus at a provisional 6.6 billion marks. The
provisional February trade surplus was confirmed.
    The Office said the March trade surplus had also risen
strongly from the year-ago month total of 8.5 billion marks,
while the March current account surplus compared with only 4.3
billion marks a year earlier.
    The figures given by the office show nominal trade flows,
but an office statement said that the current account surplus
had also risen in real terms from February.
    However, it attributed this partly to the fact that
payments to the European Community had been brought forward in
February, with the result that transfers abroad in March were
unusually low.
    The Statistics Office said March imports totalled 36.93
billion marks, a rise of 15 pct from February and of 4.7 pct
compared with March 1986.
    March exports of 47.06 billion marks were 11 pct higher
than in February and 7.6 pct higher than in March last year.
    Other data reported in the current account balance showed
there was a 400 mln mark deficit in supplementary trade items,
a 500 mln mark deficit in the services account and a 400 mln
mark deficit in transfer payments.
    The Statistics Office said that in the first three months
of this year the trade surplus had risen to 27.8 billion marks
from 22.6 billion marks in the same period last year.
    The current account surplus had risen to 20.0 billion marks
from 15.6 billion.

West German use of tapioca is likely to
decline further despite favourable prices and import licences
for only 420,000 tonnes have been registered since the start of
the current agricultural year, compared with 640,000 tonnes
during August/April the previous year, trade sources said.
    The 12 European Community (EC) countries have licensed a
total of 4.22 mln tonnes, while at the same year-earlier period
the EC contracted for 3.17 mln tonnes, they said.
    The Netherlands is registering an increase in licences to
around 2.9 mln tonnes, up 400,000 tonnes from last year, they
said.
    Total EC tapioca imports during the current agricultural
year are expected to stagnate at last year's level of around
6.0 mln tonnes, the sources said.
    They reported a rise in consumption and in import licences
for France, Spain and Belgium but said the West German compound
feed industry was increasingly using grain in feed mixtures.
    Sellers quoted tapioca for nearby delivery at around 27
marks per 100 kilos against 37 marks in March and 34 marks in
April last year.
    Feed barley was quoted at about 42 marks per 100 kilos,
resulting in higher West German feed stuff prices, but demand
was seen as slack.
    The sources said the West German feed industry was trying
to help cut the grain surplus through increased use of grain in
feed mixtures.
    Other EC member countries are likely to take advantage of
the lower tapioca prices, they said.

Speculation abroad that the
Bundesbank will steer money market rates lower, opening the
for interest rate cuts around Europe, is not shared by many
economists and money market dealers within Germany.
    Speculation has developed that the Bundesbank would
engineer lower rates to take pressure off the dollar/mark.
    A strong rise in U.S. Market rates this month, prompting
speculation the Fed would raise its 5-1/2 pct discount rate,
has raised the question whether Germany and Japan would also
broaden interest rate differentials to support the dollar.
    The U.S.-Japanese trade dispute is the key to the interest
rate outlook, money market dealers in Paris said.
    Talks this week between Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro
Nakasone and President Reagan, if successful, could take
pressure off the dollar, dealers and economists said.
    Short term interest rates would be likely to ease if the
trade dispute is solved and the dollar steadies, they said.
    But if no solution is found, the Paris dealers said, a
renewed dollar fall would put strains on the mark/French franc
rate and force the Bank of France to raise short-term rates.
    The three-month U.S. Treasury bill rate rose to six pct
this week from 5.6 pct at the start of April, and the yield on
the 30-year benchmark treasury bonds rose this week in Tokyo to
a 14-month high of 8.86 pct from 7.66 pct in late March.
    The dollar stabilized today just below 1.80 marks and above
140 yen, underpinned by higher U.S. Rates and the Fed discount
rate speculation.
    But most dealers expect it to weaken further, which would
put pressure on the Bundesbank to ease interest rates.
    Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said yesterday
the U.S. Had requested Japan to cut short-term interest rates.
    The Bank of Japan was making efforts to do this, he said,
adding the U.S. Had not asked for a cut in Japan's 2.5 pct
discount rate, a move which Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi
Sumita said was not under consideration.
    A call for a German move came yesterday from Dutch central
bank president Wim Duisenberg, who said the Dutch central bank
favoured a cut in West German interest rates and would follow
suit if it happened.
    Citibank AG said in its April report that another expected
phase of dollar weakness would prompt the Bundesbank to cut key
money market rates in the next three to six months.
    The Bundesbank has set a fixed rate of 3.80 pct on
repurchase pacts since February, with call money trading around
3.70 pct for much of April.
    Phillips and Drew senior European economist Richard Reid
said the Bundesbank would allow interest rates to ease further,
either with a lower fixed rate tender, or a tender by interest
rate, allowing the market to set the rate.
    "I'm fairly confident we'll see lower rates," he said.
    Reid said taking 30 basis points off the repurchase rate
would have little impact on the German economy or fundamental
exchange rates, but could change market currency perceptions.
    "A cut in German rates wouldn't be bad for the dollar, but I
think its effect would be limited in duration unless it was
accompanied by other measures elsewhere," he said.
    Money market dealers here noted the speculation abroad that
the Bundesbank would push down repurchase rates, but said the
Bundesbank had little reason to cut rates further at the
moment, despite the liquid market seen for most of this month.
    The dealers said the Bundesbank was likely to move to an
interest rate tender for its repurchase pacts next month. That
should not be seen as a sign of easing monetary policy however,
they said.
    The Bundesbank would merely be experimenting with interest
rate tenders, following the introduction of a new system to
speed up the tender process at the start of April, they said.
    Reinhard Pohl, head of the monetary policy section at the
DIW economic research institute in West Berlin, said the
Bundesbank would probably not cut rates on repurchase pacts.
    "I don't think that if they cut the repurchase rate a little
it would stop a wave of (currency) speculation," he said. But a
sharp and sudden deterioration in the dollar could force the
Bundesbank to take some action, he said.
    Pohl said the Bundesbank was concerned that a cut in
interest rates would accelerate excessive monetary growth.
    Some Bundesbank officials have argued recently that the
monetary overshoot was due to strong currency inflows rather
than credit growth, and therefore a more appropriate response
to excessive money supply growth would be to cut rates, to make
the mark and mark investments less attractive.
    Pohl said the Bundesbank was hoping that domestic investors
would switch funds parked in liquid short-term accounts, which
have swollen central bank money stock, into securities, which
would take them out of the Bundesbank's key monetary measure.
    A cut in interest rates at this stage however would lead
investors to assume that rates had bottomed out and the next
move would be upwards. They would therefore hold off buying
bonds, leaving central bank money stock swollen.
    There are so far no signs that German investors are
switching funds into long term securities as the Bundesbank
hopes they will, Berliner Handels- und Frankfurter Bank
economist Hermann Remsperger said.
    But Phillips and Drew's Reid said prospects of lower rates
and a strong currency would attract foreign investors into
German bonds, which would in turn attract domestic investors.
    Werner Rein, chief economist at Union Bank of Switzerland
in Zurich, said he thought it likely that interest rates would
continue to drift lower in many European countries.
    "The scope for lower rates is probably greatest in Britain
but more limited in West Germany, where we could see some
consolidation," he said. Switzerland could be forced to match
any cut in German rates to prevent the franc rising further
against the mark, he said.
    Currency dealers in London said another half-point cut in
U.K. Bank base rates was likely in the next few weeks as the
pound had shrugged off yesterday's cuts and was still rising.

A 0.4 pct rise in the March U.S. index
of leading indicators points to continued moderate U.S. real
economic growth, economists said.
    "The report is consistent with a modestly growing economy,"
said Steve Slifer of Lehman Government Securities Inc. "The
economy is not robust, but we're not heading into a recession
either."
    "The report suggests more of the same: continued moderate
growth," said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Government and Co
Inc. "The gain was mostly in stock prices. There was no change
in the fundamental movement of the economy."
    The Commerce Department said that higher stock prices led
the March gain. Unemployment claims, vendor performance,
contracts and orders for plant and equipment, manufacturers'
orders, and building permits also were positive.
    The average workweek, raw materials prices, and money
supply detracted from the index.
    Economists noted that the index signals the direction but
not the magnitude of changes in gross national product.
    "You can't derive profound conclusions on the economy from
the report," McCarthy said. "The link between leading
indicators and the economy is not strong."

The U.K. Economy looks stronger than it
did only last month, when the government unveiled its budget
for fiscal 1987/88, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson
said.
    He told Parliament that "all the indicators that have been
published since the budget confirm that, if anything, we are
doing even better than I suggested then." The budget was
unveiled on March 17.
    "The PSBR (Public Sector Borrowing Requirement) has come out
lower than I forecast in the Budget. Inflation, too, is lower
than I suggested ... (and) the current account of the balance
of payments is also performing better, so far, than I
predicted."
    The budget foresaw inflation easing to 4.0 pct at the end
of this year after peaking at around 4.5 pct. Lawson said at
the time that the overall 1986/87 PSBR would be around 4.0
billion stg. It was in fact lower, at 3.3 billion stg.
    He had also projected average GDP growth in calendar 1987
of 3.0 pct after 2.5 pct in 1986. Lawson today said "output
appears to be rising, if anything, rather faster."
    Speaking during a House of Commons debate, he said, "by the
end of this year we will have registered the longest period of
steady growth, at close to 3.0 pct a year, that the British
economy has known since the (Second World) War."
    The 1987/88 budget contained a proposal to cut the basic
rate of taxation by two pence, to 27 pence in the pound.
    Lawson today reaffirmed that the government aimed to
further cut the standard rate to "no more than 25p." He said that
that objective "should not take too long to achieve."
    Turning to policies proposed by political opposition
parties, Lawson said those advocated by the Labour Party would
entail extra public expenditure of some 34 billion stg.
    That, he said, "would require either a doubling of the basic
rates of income tax or more than trebling the standard rate of
(valued added tax) VAT," which is currently 15 pct.
    On value added tax, Lawson noted that the Conservative
government promised back in 1984 not to extend VAT to food.
    "Beyond that, the incidence of taxation has to be determined
in the light of the budgetary needs at the time, and no
responsible government could conceivably take any other
position," he said. Labour MPs have accused the Conservatives of
planning VAT increases for some essential consumer goods.
    Lawson reiterated his belief that reductions in taxation
can often produce higher, not lower, revenues  "thus leading to
the scope for still further reductions in taxation."
    Lawson said "inheritance tax is expected this year to yield
almost 50 pct more in real terms than Capital Transfer Tax did
in 1978-79. The yield of Capital Gains Tax is forecast to be 80
pct higher in real terms, and Stamp Duty up by 140 pct."
    He said that "the greatly increased yield of Corporation
Tax, reflecting greatly increased company profitability, is
clearly connected with the reform of Corporation Taxation I
introduced in 1984, which brought the rate of tax on company
profits in this country to the lowest in the industrialised
world."

The Securities Exchange Commission
decided to allow the Midwest Stock exchange to trade 25 stocks
currently listed on the National Securities Dealers Association
Automated Quotation, NASDAQ, system.
    The SEC's unanimous decision granting so-called unlisted
trading privileges to the 25 NASDAQ securities will allow the
Midwest Exchange to begin trading the issues by May 18 under a
one-year pilot program.
    Unlisted trading privileges allow trading of stocks on an
exchange other than the one on which the stocks are listed.
    Before it would approve the Midwest Exchange request for
the unlisted trading privileges, the SEC had insisted that it
and the National Association of Securities Dealers, NASD, come
up with a way of reporting and combining information on stock
prices and transactions.
    SEC officials said they needed to be assured that 
information on the trading in and price of the securities would
be in one place, for accuracy and consistency.
    But since the exchanges still have not come with a master
plan, the SEC approved an interim plan under which NASDAQ
terminals would be put on the Midwest Exchange floor.
    All trades in the 25 over the counter securities done on
the Midewest Exchange will be quoted in the NASDAQ system as
well as on the Midwest Exchange under the interim plan.
    The NASD, Midwest Exchange and several other exchanges have
said they are working on a master plan for consolidating the
reporting of price quotes and other information on stocks now
traded on NASDAQ and listed on one or more exchanges.
    But an SEC official said such a new master reporting system
is not expected to be in place until early next year. The
Midwest Exchange proposed the interim reporting plan so that it
can begin unlisted trading immediately, he said.
    The 25 securities to be traded on the Midwest Exchange are
the first over the counter securities to be traded on any
exchange besides the NASDAQ. Some issues listed on exchanges,
however, are traded on the NASDAQ.
    The 25 securities had an average dollar volume last year of
2.4 billion dlrs and made up 18 pct of the dollar volume of all
the securities quoted on the NASD's National Market System.
    SEC officials said they would review the pilot program in
about a year. It was intended to spur more competition in the
securities industry.

A bill that would impose an oil
import fee to support a world floor price for oil of 25 dlrs a

12 Congressmen from oil-producing states.
    The variable import fee would be dropped if oil prices rise
above 25 dlrs a barrel, sponsors of the bill said.
    Revenues from the fee would be used to buy domestic oil
from stripper wells - those that produce 10 barrels a day or
less - at a fixed price of 25 dlrs a barrel. Purchases would
stop when prices rose above that level.
    "Time is running out on the domestic oil and gas industry,"

fee is really just the premium for a national insurance
policy."

Better times for the hard hit
natural gas industry remains two to three years away as a
seemingly intractable supply bubble continues to depress sales
and prices, industry officials said.
    An uncertain regulatory environment, disputes over Canadian
pricing policies and unusually warm winters are working against
a quick recovery in the sector, a number of corporate and
government speakers told an energy conference here.
    "We see a tough, tough short-term market, both as to price
and volume," said Michael Phelps, vice president of <Westcoast
Transmission Co Ltd>, a major Canadian natural gas carrier.
    But Phelps predicted a fall in U.S. supply -- caused by a
sharp drop in exploration -- and a slight demand increase
should help to burn off the excess supply by 1990.
    As a result, Canadian gas exports to the U.S. market should
rise to up to 1.5 trillion cubic feet a year by the end of the
decade, nearly double 1986's total.
    The health of the Canadian industry is heavily dependent on
the U.S. market where nearly one third of Canada's gas
production is sent.
    Cuba Wadlington, a vice president at Northwest Pipeline
Corp of Salt Lake City, shared the view that markets could be
in balance by 1990.
    He said while North American demand for natural gas has
flattened at about 18 trillion cubic feet a year, a return to
more colder winters in the next few years could quickly tighten
supplies.
    "Things are clearly working towards a shrinking of the
bubble," Wadlington told

Offshore drilling for oil and gas will
be moving into deeper and deeper waters, according to Ronald L.
Geer, a consultant with Shell Oil Co. and president of the
Marine Technology Society.
     Geer told a press conference at the Offshore Technology
Conference that the technology existed to drill exploratory
wells in up to 10,000 feet of water.
     But he added that as the industry moves more and more to
floating systems as opposed to fixed bottom supported
structures, the financial risks involved were greater.
     He said such projects involved six to nine year time
frames, and there was a "reluctance for people to stick their
necks too far out."
     Shell holds the world record for the deepest exploratory
well, at 6,900 feet, in the Wilmington Canyon in the Atlantic
offshore New Jersey in 1984.
     The company is currently drilling a 6,700 foot well in the
Atwater Valley in the Gulf of Mexico offshore Louisiana.
     Meanwhile, Brazil's Petrobras set a world record for
underwater production when they brought a well in 1,350 feet of
water offshore Rio de Janeiro state into production in January.
     Geer said the industry was particularly interested in the
Green Canyon field offshore Louisiana where a number of
companies, including Shell, a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell <RD>,
Dupont Co's <DD> Conoco Inc, USX Corp's <X> Marathon Oil Co,
Standard Oil Co <SRD> and <Placid Oil Co>, are working, many of
them testing new deep-water technologies.
     Of particular interest is the controversial Penrod-72
system being operated by the Dallas-based Hunt brothers who
last year placed Placid Oil under bankruptcy court protection
in order to avoid foreclosures on its valuable oil properties.
     They have been seeking the right to use assets to drill
oil wells in the Green Canyon through Penrod, arguing that
continued development of the project is essential to their
ability to get out of their financial crisis.
     Earlier this month, the Hunts were granted permission by a
bankruptcy court to pursue the Green Canyon project.
     The Penrod system involves a controversial floating
production platform with well heads sitting 1,350 feet down on
the ocean floor. Some 24 wells will be attached to the
wellhead, with one satellite well sitting in a record 1,700
feet of water.
     Geer said he could not comment on the Penrod project,
other than to note that it involves so many new technologies,
it might have a problem fitting all the pieces together within
a specific time frame.
     He also said he believed the potential production from the
project could be in line with what the Hunt Brothers have
projected
.
     The Hunts' creditor banks have contended the Hunts have
exaggerated the potential of the project.
     "They're in the ballpark," he said, of the numbers, adding
that he did not have enough information to comment further.

Demand for natural gas has failed to
grow in proportion to the decline in oil deliveries because of
concerns over unresolved regulatory issues in the United
States, said industry analysts and gas utility company sources.
    "Natural gas is not free to compete," said Larry Makovich,
director of utilities service at Data Resources Inc, "problems
on pipeline open access and take-or-pay liabilities still weigh
heavily on end-users' decision to switch to natural gas."
    A manager with an East Coast gas distribution company,
agreed that reluctance among end-users often stemmed from fear
of unresolved regulatory issues.
    "The fact that at the federal level open access is not yet
firmly in place threatens to impede free flow of natural gas
from producers to consumers," he said.
     Michael German, an economist with the American Gas
Association, said while a significant amount of gas was now
replacing oil in dual-fuel boilers, the progress of expanding
the marketshare of gas was slow. First quarter natural gas
consumption data is not available until June.
    In the first three months of 1987, residual fuel demand
fell by an average of 55,000 barrels per day, according to the
American Petroleum Institute. Natural gas, however, was not
able to take full advantage of the decline in oil consumption.
    AGA's German said that while industrial consumers were
concerned with regulatory issues in their long-range capital
investment decisions, in the dual-fuel boiler market relied on
spot purchases.
    "With all the capability of switching (from oil to natural
gas) already there, price of the fuel is the only concern," he
said, adding that compared with the same period last year,
January natural gas price at burner tip is 16 pct lower for
industrial users and 32 pct lower for utilities.
    German attributed the sluggish performance of natural gas
to lower demand in the utility sector as a whole.
    "March was warmer than normal, which cut down gas
consumption not only in home heating but also in electricity
generation," he said.
     In March, according to API monthly statistics, residual
fuel deliveries fell by 13.6 pct to 1.2 mln barrels per day
from the same period a year ago.
    While API specifically mentioned lower natural gas prices
had put residual fuel at a price disadvantage among electric
utilities and industrial users, industry analysts believed the
role of natural gas was over-stated.
    Makovich of DRI noted much of the decline in oil in the
fuel mix was taken up by new nuclear capacity coming on stream
in the last few years.
    Nuclear capacity rose nine pct in 1986, and he projected
the same rate of growth for 1987 and 11 pct growth in 1988. 
    In contrast, oil and gas together represented only 15 pct
of the fuel mix in 1986 and should decline to 13 pct by 1989,
he said. Within this sector, gas share fell to 66 pct in 1986
from 76 pct a year ago due to competition from falling oil
prices, he added. But this year, gas was expected to recapture
only two pct of the share, Makovich said.
    Michael German of AGA agreed and said, "Nevertheless,
outlet for several hundred billion cubic feet of gas a year is
significant in a glutted market."

President Reagan said a further
decline in the value of the dollar could be counterproductive.
    In written answers to questions put by Japan's Asahi
Shimbun newspaper, he noted Treasury Secretary James Baker had
said all seven major industrial nations were committed to
cooperating in fostering stability of exchange rates.
    "We all believe a further decline of the dollar could be
counterproductive," Reagan said.
    Reagan said the best way for the United States to reduce
its trade deficit was to export more.
    He said Japan could make a major contribution to reducing
external imbalances and sustaining world economic growth by
adopting policies to promote stronger domestic demand in the
short-run and, in the long-run, implementing structural reforms
to ease Japanese dependence on exports as a source of growth.

Coastal Corp and TransAmerican Natural
Gas Corp have proposed settling more than four billion dlrs in
lawsuits with an agreement for natural gas sales and
transportation between the two Texas firms, a lawyer for
Coastal said.
    The proposed settlement also provided for Coastal to
withdraw its reorganization plan in TransAmerican's bankruptcy
proceedings.
    Thomas McDade, a lawyer for Coastal, said the settlement
included a five-year agreement for TransAmerican to transport
up to 100 mln cubic feet of natural gas daily from south Texas
fields to major pipeline interchanges. TransAmerican will also
sell Coastal up to 125 mln cubic feet of gas at spot market
prices during the next 10 years.
    McDade said Coastal would agree to support TransAmerican's
plan of reorganization pending in federal bankruptcy court.
    TransAmerican, a Houston-based natural gas production and
pipeline company, had sued Coastal for 4.1 billion dlrs
alleging that Coastal chairman Oscar Wyatt wrongly interfered
with TransAmerican's reorganization efforts. Coastal is one of
TransAmerican's unsecured creditors.

U.S. Interior Secretary Donald
Hodel said he does not support an oil import fee as a means to
stimulate domestic oil and gas production.
    "I am an advocate for incentives for exploration," Hodel
said, but added, "I do not favor an oil import fee."
    "It would inject the federal government so deeply back in
to the process, we would never get the government out again,
and I think that would be in the long term disinterest of the
nation," Hodel said in an address to a group of local business
executives.
    Earlier today, Congressmen from oil producing states
introduced a bill that would impose a fee on oil imports.
    Hodel said he supports drilling incentives, such as repeal
of the Windfall Profits Tax and Fuel Use Act and deregulation
of natural gas.
    The secretary also said oil and gas exploration offshore
California and in the Artic National Wildlife Refuge is
necessary to prevent the U.S. from becoming too dependent on
foreign supplies of oil for its energy needs.
    Failure to approve such exploration, Hodel said, would lead
to greater U.S. dependence on foreign sources of oil.
    "In the next two to five years, no matter what we do today,
we are very likely to find the U.S becoming 50 pct or more
dependent on imports for its oil requirements," Hodel said.
    If OPEC were to raise oil prices sharply, Congress would
likely act to have the federal government fix gasoline prices
and allocate supplies, Hodel said.
    "If they allocate supplies you and I, in the same
two-to-five year time frame, could well find ourselves sitting
back in gas lines," Hodel said.
    Exploration for oil and gas in offshore areas and in the
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge would not jeopardize
environmentally sensitive areas, Hodel said.
    "We are convinced we can meet and resolve every
environmental concern that is raised," Hodel said.

An oil import fee could cost
consumers nearly 17 billion dlrs a year and undermine long-term
U.S. energy security by leading to a quicker depletion of 
domestic reserves, a Federal Trade Commission study said.
    The study by the FTC's bureau of economics found that a
five dlr a barrel tariff on crude oil and gasoline oil imports
would increase costs to consumers by 14 to 16.7 billion dlrs a
year.
    After weighing the benefits of such a tariff against the
costs, the study found a five dlr a barrel import fee would
have a net cost to the economy of 3.6 billion dlrs a year.
    Several oil import fee proposals ranging from two to 10
dlrs a barrel have been made in Congress in an effort to cut
the federal budget deficit and maintain the momentum for energy
conservation programs, which have been hurt by cheaper oil.
    But by making foreign oil more expensive, the tariffs would
reduce oil imports and force greater consumption of domestic
oil, which would deplete U.S. reserves faster, the study found.
    "Any attempt to increase our energy security by limiting
imports will actually reduce our long-run energy security by
speeding the depletion of domestic reserves," the study said.
    The five dlr a barrel tariff would also cut domestic
petroleum refiners' profits by 7.5 to 10 billion dlrs a year,
increase domestic crude oil producers' profits by about 13
billion dlrs a year and raise government revenues by 6.7 to 
8.2 billion dlrs a year, the FTC said.
    Under the Reagan administration, the FTC has consistently
opposed government regulation of the oil industry at the state
and federal levels.
    "This study backs up my belief that government regulation
and interference with competition hurt both the market and
consumers," FTC Chairman Daniel Oliver said in a statement.

The depressed offshore oil industry is
still waiting for a turnaround despite increasing optimisim
that world oil prices have stabilized around 18 dlrs a barrel.
     "The perception of a turnaround comes from the change in
prices," Charles Siess Jr, vice chairman of Marathon
Manufacturing Co, a subsidiary of USX Corp <X>, and chairman of
the National Ocean Industries Association, said in a press
briefing at the Offshore Technology Conference.
     "From the level of industry activity, there is no
turnaround," he added.
     John Huff, president of Oceaneering International Inc
<OCER>, was slightly more optimistic. "We are through the low
part of the cycle -- there's an increase in interest for
projects," he said, adding, "whether it comes to orders, who
knows?"
     The oil industry is recovering from last year's dramatic
fall in oil prices, from 30 dlrs a barrel in late 1985 to under
10 dlrs in mid-1986. Particularly hard hit were the service
companies that provide the oil rigs with keys products, such as
pipe and tools.
     Earlier in the week, Secretary the Interior Donald Hodel
announced -- at the Conference -- the government's new
five-year offshore oil and gas leasing program, proposing 38
sales, including tracts in the Gulf Coast, offshore California
and in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska.
     For the most part, the industry was disappointed with the
plan, with most arguing that additional areas should have been
included. At the same time, most were supportive of Hodel.
     Environmental concerns, particularly in California, had
lobbied strenuously against offshore oil development.
     "The (Outer Continental Shelf) leasing program fails to
take into account the environmental performance of the oil
industry," said Bill Bradford, executive vice president of
Dresser Industries <DI> and president of the Petroleum
Equipment Suppliers Association.
     Huff quoted National Academy of Science figures showing
offshore rigs contributed only two pct of petroleum pollution
in the oceans, while tankers were responsible for 47 pct and
municiple dumping 31 pct.
     "The OCS is the keystone of the domestic reserve
development program," said Siess, adding that with oil imports
rising to 50 pct of U.S. oil consumption, the issue was one of
national security.
     Looking ahead, Constantine S. Nicandros, president of
Dupont's <DD> Conoco Inc subsidiary, said, "We are more likely
to see a five pct increase in spending this year than the
widely-forecast five pct decrease."
     Other optimistic signs include the recent sale in New
Orleans of offshore tracts in the Gulf of Mexico which raised
290 mln dlrs against an expected 90 mln.
     However, Ronald Tappmeyer, vice chairman of Reading and
Bates Drilling Co <RB>, said the oversupply of rigs would
continue for the near-term, but added demand for
technologically advanced rigs would increase in the 1990s.
     Much of that demand is seen coming from the move into
icreasingly deeper waters, with the projects becoming ever more
expensive and needing five to ten years to develop.
     Over 50 pct of the sales in New Orleans were for deep
water tracts.
     Ronald L. Geer, a consultant with Shell Oil Co, a
subsidiary of Royal Dutch/Shell <RD>, and president of the
Marine Technology Society, said the technology existed to drill
exploratory wells in up to 10,000 feet of water.
     Geer said the industry was particularly interested in the
Green Canyon field offshore Louisiana where a number of
companies, including Shell, Conoco, USX Corp's Marathon Oil Co,
Standard Oil Co <SRD> and Placid Oil Co, are working, many of
them testing new deep-water technologies involving floating
platforms.

The European Commission should make urgent
and concrete proposals to break the deadlock over moves to cut
sky-high European airfares, an independent report said.
    The report by the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA) said
costs, fares and profits on international services within
Europe are the highest in the world although European airlines
are less efficient and not perceptibly safer than their cheaper
U.S. Equivalents.
    "The European airlines protect their position through the
secrecy they maintain over the costs and profits of any group
of services," the report said.
    The airlines also protect themselves through "the ferocity
with which (they) resist any relaxation of the monopolistic
practices which protect their profits," the report said.
    Britain, a strong advocate of deregulation, has been trying
to push measures to introduce greater competition among
Europe's airlines but negotiations foundered at the end of 1986
over discount and deep discount fares.
    The IEA report said European governments and the
Commission, the EC executive authority, had been
extraordinarily lax about the airlines' secretiveness, showing
"a lack of concern for the interests of the traveller."

The use of tariffs and quotas to
reduce the flow of foreign goods into the United States will do
little to cut the nation's swelling trade deficit, a government
study said.
    In fact, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) report said,
such protectionist policies could make U.S. Products less
competitive in the world marketplace by raising the cost of
imported products that are re-exported in different forms.
    "Such policies are much more likely to hurt, rather than
help, the productive capabilities of the U.S. Economy," it said.
    The 218-page report, written by FTC economists John Hilke
and Philip Nelson, blamed the rising trade shortfall, which
climbed to a record 166.3 billion dlrs last year, on shifting
currency exchange rates and growing U.S consumer demand.
    Other factors commonly blamed for the deficit, such as
foreign trade practices, deteriorating U.S. Industrial
competitiveness, high labour costs and government restrictions
on mergers, added little to the problem, it said.
    "Although each industry's competitiveness affects the level
of imports and exports in that industry, in general we find
that there have been no significant industry-specific changes
affecting competitiveness that would explain the increase in
the overall trade deficit," the study said.
    "To the extent any government action is needed to deal with
the trade deficits, policies should focus on economy-wide
phenomena such as exchange rates and relative economic growth,"
the FTC study said.
    Supporting its conclusion that broad-based economic shifts
were the cause of the increase in the trade deficit, the report
said it found that nearly all U.S. Industries lost some
domestic market share to foreign competitors in the 1980s.
    It also said it found a "fairly direct relationship" between
the increased trade deficit and the influence of shifting
currency exchange rates, U.S. Economic growth and domestic
demand for goods and services, which has outpaced foreign
consumer demand.
    The study examined seven factors which have been commonly
blamed for the trade deficit: foreign government subsidies and
trade barriers to protect foreign industries, a lack of
investment in U.S. Industry, declining research and development
in U.S. Industry, high labour costs, union work rules, the oil
prices rises of the 1970s and U.S. Antitrust regulations.
    In each case, the study found little or no evidence that
the factor had any impact on the trade deficit.

West Germany's eurobond market may
revive in June, after two month's relative dormancy, before
dozing off for the summer, bond market sources said.
    Syndicate managers said many borrowers, anticipating lower
West German interest rates, cancelled mandates during the last
two-week calendar, hoping borrowing costs would decline.
    Borrowers are likely to return as domestic interest rates
lose downward momentum, syndicate managers said. A
supranational issue via Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozcentrale
is likely today and Dresdner Bank AG could lead a new bond.
    New issue volume is likely to be helped by a recent
domestic legal change which indirectly lowered costs for
European Community state-backed borrowers, the sources said.
    A statutory change to the West German Exchange Admissions
Act, which went into effect on May 1, allows such borrowers to
file for bourse listing without a prospectus and without an
underwriting group. This saves them the 1/2 point listing fee
formerly paid to banks.
    The two most recent issues for Electricite de France, led
by Deutsche Bank AG, and Bank of Greece, led by Commerzbank AG,
were brought to market under the new law, managers said.
    Deutsche Bank confirmed that its bond was brought out in
conformance with the new law. Commerzbank had no comment.
    The success of Commerzbank's Bank of Greece deal,
especially for the shorter of the two tranches of five and
eight years, has also encouraged syndicate managers to bring
out new issues during the new calendar period.
    Many borrowers might also seek to get their bonds in before
the market enters its quiet summer phase, referred to by German
bond dealers as the "summer hole."
    But syndicate managers said there are also some factors
standing in the way of new issues.
    One negative factor is that current swap conditions for
marks into dollars are not favourable.
    Syndicate managers said the yield spread between domestic
Schuldschein notes and mark eurobonds is now too low to make
swaps profitable for eurobond borrowers.
    Low yields on domestic notes comparable to mark eurobonds
mean German banks can now borrow cheaply at domestic rates.
    They would charge a high premium to borrowers taking up
euromarks for swaps as banks have little incentive to take on
more expensive euromark liabilities at present.
    However, some foreign borrowers might anyway borrow in
marks out of a genuine need for the currency, managers said.
    Another factor which might dampen the primary market is
uncertainty about the dollar. Its rise last week over 1.80
marks helped send West German government bonds lower by nearly
one pfennig over the week.
    If the dollar looks poised to stabilize or rise further,
foreign investors in mark eurobonds could switch out of them on
the belief that gains from the mark's appreciation were ending,
dealers said.
    The dollar is expected to remain stable this week before
the seven leading nations begin their economic summit in Venice
on June 8.
    In May, a total of 1.1 billion marks of new mark eurobonds
were launched, compared with 1.0 billion in April.
    This compared with a relatively active March, when 2.3
billion marks of eurobonds were launched, and a very strong
February, when issues totalled nearly 5.0 billion.

Toshiba Corp <TSBA.T> expects to report a
group net profit of 38 billion yen for the year ending March
31, 1988, up 11.2 pct from a year earlier, assuming an exchange
rate of 140 yen to the dollar, a company official said.
    Osamu Iemura, a senior vice president, told a news
conference sales are forecast at 3,500 billion yen, up 5.8 pct.
The forecasts are based on expectations of improved sales of
office automation equipment, a recovery in semiconductor market
prices and an increase in plant exports.
    Toshiba said earlier that 1986/87 group net profit fell
42.5 pct from a year earlier to 34.18 billion yen, the second
consecutive year-on-year drop. Sales fell 1.9 pct to 3,308
billion yen, the first year-on-year sales drop in 21 years.
    Iemura said the results reflected trade friction over
semiconductor exports to the U.S., The yen's sharp rise against
the dollar and a drop in exports to China.
    The 1986/87 foreign exchange loss totalled 145 billion yen,
including parent company losses of 120 billion.
    The average value of the yen against the dollar rose to 161
from 221 a year earlier, he added.
    Weaker prices for semiconductors and office automation
equipment cut total sales 245 billion yen, Iemura said.
    Group sales of telecommunication and electronic devices,
accounting for 36 pct of the total, rose five pct to 1,183
billion yen in 1987/88 from a year earlier, helped by good
sales of word processors, workstations, medical equipment,
point-of-sales systems and exports of personal computers.
    Semiconductor sales rose to 410 billion yen from 360
billion a year earlier but fell short of an expected 430
billion. Sales are expected to be 460 billion in 1987/88.
    Office automation equipment sales rose to 650 billion yen
in 1986/87 from 600 billion a year earlier, Iemura said. Sales
in 1987/88 are expected to be 695 billion yen, mainly due to
good sales of computers in Europe and to expectations the U.S.
Will remove its 100 pct import duty on computers.
    Sales of heavy electric goods, accounting for 26 pct of
sales, rose 0.2 pct from a year earlier to 868.14 billion yen.
    Home electronics sales fell 10 pct to 940.64 billion yen,
mainly due to the yen's appreciation against the dollar and a
drop in colour television exports to China, Iemura said.
    Overall 1986/87 overseas sales totalled 1,021 billion yen,
down three pct from a year earlier, Iemura said.
    Overseas sales of telecommunication and electronic devices
rose nine pct from a year earlier to 493.90 billion yen, helped
by a 80 pct year-on-year rise in computer and computer-related
equipment sales.
    Home appliance sales abroad fell 24 pct to 312.10 billion,
mainly due to the yen's appreciation, lower sales to China, and
increased competition with newly-industrialised countries.
    Toshiba reduced the number of divisions to three from four
in reaction to market changes, effective April 1.
    Group sales of telecommunication and electronic devices are
estimated at 1,520 billion yen in 1987/88, Iemura said.
    Home appliance sales are estimated at 1,260 billion yen and
heavy electric goods sales at 720 billion.
    Iemura said group exports to China are expected to rise to
90 billion yen in 1987/88 from 30 billion in 1986/87 due to an
increase in sales of generators.
    Sales to China were down from 70 billion yen in 1985/86 due
to a sharp drop in home appliance exports, he said.
    Group capital spending in 1987/88 will fall to 197 billion
yen from 213.30 billion in 1986/87, Iemura said.
    Of total capital spending, investment in semiconductors
will fall to 65 billion from 68 billion.
    Research and development spending will rise to 217 billion
yen from 201.10 billion, he said.

    Oil refiners and utilities face a sharp profit fall after
two years of high profits due to the yen's strength, lower
world oil prices and reduced interest rates, it said.
    Sales of all firms are expected to rise 2.3 pct from the
previous year when they fell 11.9 pct from a year earlier.
    The independent institute surveyed 436 firms listed in the
first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, excluding banks and
insurance firms. Excluding the oil refiners and utilities, Wako
forecasts that current profits will rise 3.7 pct after a 22.3
pct drop in 1986/87 and a 19.5 pct drop in 1985/86.
    Electric power firms and gas companies are likely to see
42.5 and 31.6 pct falls in current profits respectively in
1987/88 due to cuts in utility prices to recycle windfall
profits made during the yen's rise against the dollar, and due
to the recent recovery in world oil prices, the institute said.
    Current profits of manufacturing industries will rise an
average seven pct after a 29.7 pct drop in 1986/87 and a 25.0
pct drop in 1985/86, Wako said.
    An increase in overseas production and an expected increase
in domestic demand will cause the recovery in manufacturing
sector profits, it said.

Crude oil prices could remain around 18
dlrs a barrel until the end of the year, but OPEC's decision on
output at its next meeting would be the critical factor, an
official of Mexico's state oil company, Petroleos Mexicanos
(Pemex), told a group of Japanese businessmen.
    Adrian Lajous, Pemex' executive vice president of
international trade, said current OPEC output already appeared
to be very near the 16.6 mln barrel per day level it set itself
for the third quarter. "Production is surging ahead of what was
originally planned, while demand is growing more slowly than
envisaged a few months ago," he said.
    He said OPEC had to look very carefully at what level of
production in the third quarter would effectively sustain the
18 dlrs price, and that an increase to what had originally been
envisaged might soften price levels.
    The 13-member cartel is scheduled to meet on June 25 in
Vienna to review its December accord on prices and output.
    "I hope OPEC will follow a very conservative attitude in
terms of volume decisions," Lajous said.
    A repetition of what happened last year, when OPEC boosted
output and sent oil prices tumbling down below 10 dlrs, is
always there as a possibility, he said.
    "I hope never again to go through the trauma of 1986. I
expect other oil exporters have learned their lessons and
discipline will be maintained," he said.
    Lajous said there was still excess supply and as long as
this remains there will be a tendency to instability in oil
markets, but prices should remain around 18 to 19 dlrs during
1987 if output remains under control.
    He said Saudi King Fahd's remarks last month, that
increased production was not so important as long as incomes
would not be affected by the output, were "very relevant and
welcome from such a powerful producer."

Three United Steelworkers
of America locals on strike at Cominco Ltd rejected a tentative
three-year contract, a union representative said.
    "The vote was 1,229, or 54.5 pct, against, and 1,028, or
45.5 pct, for the contract. Eighty-one pct of the membership
voted," he said.
    The union representative said that the pact offered cost of
living increases designed to keep pace with inflation, but
contained no wage increase.
    The locals' bargaining committees are expected to meet and
prepare for the reopening of negotiations with Cominco, he
said.
    The three locals cover about 2,600 production and
maintenance workers at Cominco's Trail smelter and Kimberley,
B.C. lead-zinc mine.
    Output at both sites has been shut down since the
production and maintenance workers, along with about 600 office
and technical workers, went on strike May 9.
    The two Steelworkers locals representing the office and
technical workers have not negotiated since May 21.
    The strike caused Cominco to declare force majeure, which
means the company may not be able to honor contracts for
products from the smelter and mine.
    Each of the five locals have separate contracts, all of
which expired April 30, but the main issues are similar.
    The union had requested a three pct wage increase in each
year of a two-year contract. Cominco had pressed for a
three-year contract and some loosening of the rules on job
classifications.
    The Trail smelter, about 400 miles east of Vancouver,
produced 240,000 long tons of zinc and 110,000 long tons of
lead last year. The Sullivan mine at Kimberley, about 450 miles
east of Vancouver, produced 2.2 mln long tons of ore last year,
most for processing at the Trail smelter.
    The smelter also produced cadmium, bismuth and indium.

U.S. corporate treasurers are expected
to race to market this week, propelled by hopes that the recent
recoveries of the Treasury market and the dollar will whet
investors' appetities for new issues, underwriters said.
    Underwriters expect to price about 2.3 billion dlrs of new
debt issues this week, including an asset-backed debt deal.
    "Treasurers have been sitting on the sidelines for weeks,
waiting to pounce," said an underwriter with a large Wall
Street house. "They will hit the market at a fast pace as long
as the dollar remains stable."
    "The financing calendar is the heaviest it has been in
weeks," said a trader with a small securities firm.
    "And there are billions of dollars on the SEC shelf that
can come to market at any time," he said, referring to company
debt filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
    Investment bankers said last week signaled a surge in
financings. New debt offerings rose to nearly 2.8 billion dlrs
during the holiday-shortened week from 2.09 billion dlrs in the
previous week, they calculated.
    "And most of (last week's) issues were not even on the
calendar," an underwriter remarked.
    Analysts noted that in the past few months the fixed-income
markets became virtually obsessed with the dollar. The
currency's sharp drop ignited fears that foreign investors
would shun dollar-denominated debt vehicles.
    Also, many participants believed inflation would gather
momentum because of the dollar's fall. Inflation is the number
one enemy of fixed-rate investments, analysts explained.
    But the dollar's recovery last week calmed worries in the
Treasury and corporate bond markets over foreign investor
demand and inflation. The resulting decline in yields should
bring company treasurers to market, traders said.
    Underwriters are slated to bid competitively tomorrow for
250 mln dlrs of first mortgage bonds due 2017 of Georgia Power
Co, a unit of Southern Co <SO>. The issue is rated Baa-1 by
Moody's Investors and BBB-plus by Standard and Poor's.
    This would be Georgia Power's first bond issue in the U.S.
since August 1986 when it sold 250 mln dlrs of same-rated,
same-maturity 10 pct bonds yielding 250 basis points more than
comparable Treasury securities.
    Tomorrow will see another competitive. Syndicates will bid
for 100 mln dlrs of 30-year bonds rated A-1/A-plus of Virginia
Electric and Power Co, a unit of Dominion Resources Inc <D>.
    Virginia Electric last visited the domestic debt market in
October 1986 when the utility issued 100 mln dlrs of
same-rated, same-maturity 9-1/4 pct bonds. The bonds were
priced to yield 9.27 pct, or 141 basis points over Treasuries.
    The biggest investment grade deal tentatively scheduled for
pricing this week is 600 mln dlrs of securities due 1992 backed
by the automobile loan receivables of Marine Midland Banks
<MM>. Salomon Brothers Inc will head the syndicate.
    The Marine Midland issue follows last week's offering of
230 mln dlrs of car loan backed debt by RepublicBank Dallas NA,
a unit of RepublicBank Corp <RPT>, underwriters noted.
    Goldman, Sachs and Co led the group for the RepublicBank
deal. First Boston Corp and Salomon Brothers, the most active
underwriters of asset-backed securities, were co-managers.
    First Boston has dominated the asset-backed market since
introducing the concept of selling these securities in March
1985. It has a commanding 86.1 pct share of the 12.5 billion
dlr market, according to figures tabluated by First Boston.
    Salomon Brothers is in second place with a market share of
8.8 pct, followed by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc's share of 3.5
pct of the market. Goldman Sachs is next with a 1.6 pct market
share that was calculated before the RepublicBank Dallas deal.
    Indeed, investment bankers say that banks will be the most
frequent issuers of asset-backed securities this year. The
finance arms of the U.S. automakers accounted for the bulk of
last year's offerings, with General Motors Corp's <GM> General
Motors Acceptance Corp taking the lion's share of that.
    The Marine Midland cars deal is rated a top-flight AAA by
both Moody's and Standard and Poor's because it is backed by a
letter of credit by Union Bank of Switzerland.
    Recently, Imperial Savings and Loan Association of San
Diego filed a registration statement with the SEC covering 100
mln dlrs of credit card backed debt, underwriters noted.

The supercomputer industry is getting
crowded as a handful of startup companies and some huge
Japanese manufacturers compete for the right to apply the label
"world's fastest machine" to their products.
    Currently there are only about 250 supercomputers installed
around the world, but many believe that situation is about to
change dramatically as these highly specialized and extremely
expensive machines move out of the research laboratories where
most of them are found today and into commerical applications.
    "It is commercial supercomputing... that holds the most
promise for this young industry's handful of vendors," said
Gary Smaby, supercomputer analyst for Piper Jaffray and
Hopwood.
    These commercial applications, he said, could propel annual
sales of supercomputers from 850 mln dlrs in 1986 to 2.4
billion by 1990.
    For years two companies, Cray Research Inc <CYR> and
Control Data Corp  <CDA> were virtually the only options for
customers seeking to buy supercomputers.
    But in the last three years a number of new companies have
announced supercomputers using some innovative technologies,
and the industry finally expanded enough to hold its first
World Supercomputer Exhibition in Santa Clara last month.
    Also in the last month two small companies, ETA Systems Inc
(a subsidiary of Control Data) and Thinking Machines Corp  both
laid claim to having the world's fastest computer and a joint
venture of Honeywell Inc <HON> and Japan's NEC Corp <NIPN.T>
Honeywell-NEC Supercomputers Inc, announced its entrance into
the U.S. market.
    All three are aiming at industry leader Cray Research Inc,
which holds more than 60 pct of the market.
    This week, Cray plans to make a joint announcement with
Digital Equipment Corp, <DEC> already the world's largest
minicomputer maker, of some products that will work on both
companies' computers, expanding the market opportunities for
both supers and minis even further.
    Supercomputers were initially designed only for the most
complex of applications, such as predicting worldwide weather
patterns, fusion energy research or military defense and
weapons design.
    They are built for speed, not for standard business
functions such as payroll processing. The fastest
supercomputers can perform more than a billion calculations per
second, greater than the combined power of 100,000 personal
computers.
    They also carry stratospheric price tags of between one mln
to 20 mln dlrs each, which is why Cray's revenues could reach
600 mln dlrs last year even though it only shipped 36 new and
10 used supercomputers, a level that would spell starvation for
any standard computer company.        
    But speakers at the supercomputer exhibition emphasized
that a host of new applications should increase total industry
shipments to 150 systems a year by the end of the decade.
    Most commercial customers of supercomputers now use the
machines to simulate a physical process, such as the flow of
air over an aircraft wing, in design and testing work.
    But financial institutions, particularly Wall Street
brokerage houses, are considered the next major buyers of
supercomputers as they try to recognize changes in stock
trading patterns faster than any of their competitors.
    Two firms, Goldman Sachs and Co and Morgan Stanley and Co,
are now using superminicomputers, hybrid machines that are
faster than a minicomputer but cheaper than a super, to create
financial models of the stock and bond markets.
    Analysts said it is only a matter of time before actual
supercomputers are found on Wall Street.
    One reason for the shift to commercial applications is that
supercomputers are coming down in price as new technologies
provide greater speed at lower costs than the Cray and Control
Data behemoths.
    Both the ETA and Thinking Machines Systems use a technology
called parallel processing, in which a number of internal
processors work together to solve a problem.
    With such systems a problem is broken up and different
segments are assigned to different processors. By contrast,
standard computers solve a problem one instruction at a time,
or sequentially.
    The ETA system, the ETA 10, will eventually use as many as
eight parallel processors capable of processing up to 8.32
billion operations per second.
    However, the first ETA 10, installed at Florida State
University, has only two processors, later to be expanded to
four.  ETA president Lloyd Thorndyke said the ETA 10 represents
a drastic change in architecture from parent company Control
Data's Cyber system.
    Priced from 5.5 mln to 22 mln dlrs, the ETA 10 contains
about 240 chips in each of its processing units, built onto a
board about the size of a standard newspaper section.
    Each of these boards contains the equivalent of 1.5 miles
of embedded wiring.
    It took ETA about 3-1/2 years to develop its supercomputer
but Thorndyke said he expects much faster development time
frames in the futre, from both ETA and its competitors.
    "We're in a leapfrog business and we just took the last
leap," he said.
    Thinking Machines also claims to have the world's fastest
computer and in some ways this is true. Its Connection Machine
Model CM-2 can process 2.5 billion instructions per second, but
it is a very specialized architecture only meant for certain
very specific applications.
    The one mln to five mln dlr Connection Machine uses a
technology called "massive parallism." It contains 64,000
processors crammed into a five foot cube. The processors all
work on a problem at once, breaking it down into minute bits.
    It is an ideal tool for applications with many
unpredicatble variables, according to Brian Boyle, analyst for
Novon Research Group. "The more unpredictable things are, the
more the Thinking Machine will be appropriate," he said.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture's
forecast that French end-of-season soft wheat stocks will
almost double in 1987/88 is premature but would not be
surprising, according to French cereal organisation officials.
    The Cereals Intervention Board, ONIC, Wheat Producers'
Association and the National Union of Agricultural and Cereal
Cooperatives have not yet forecast 1987/88 exports or
end-of-season stocks.
    However, the officials said the USDA's figure of end
1987/88 stocks at 5.03 mln tonnes against 1986/87's 2.87 mln
was not surprising given a record high yield forecast in April.
    The French Feed Cereals Research Institute, ITCF, forecast
in mid-April an average yield of 6.58 tonnes per hectare for
soft wheat in 1987/88 compared with 5.6 tonnes in 1986/87 and
the record high yield of 6.5/6.6 tonnes in 1984.
    This would result in a French soft wheat harvest of around
31 mln tonnes against 25.5 mln in 1986/87, given a Ministry of
Agriculture estimate of area planted of 4.66 mln hectares
against 4.61 mln in 1986/87.
    ONIC's first preliminary forecast of the 1987/88 campaign
will be released at the beginning of September, an ONIC
official said.
    Soft wheat exports in 1987/88 were extremely difficult to
estimate at this stage, both within the European Community and
to non-EC countries, an ONIC official said.
    He said, however, that among countries to which France
could increase its wheat exports were Egypt and the Maghreb
countries (Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia), he said.
    The USDA's forecast of an 11.65 mln tonne maize crop in
1987/88 against 11.48 mln in 1986/87, while again premature,
was not out of line with estimates of the French Maize
Producers Association, AGPM, an AGPM official said.
    Maize plantings would be down in 1987/88 but yields were
expected to be higher, the AGPM official said.
    It estimated 1987/88 maize plantings of 1.73 mln hectares,
down seven pct from the 1.87 mln hectares planted in 1986/87.

    The boards of both companies have approved the merger,
which will be accomplished through a tender offer by a Boeing
subsidiary of 37 dlrs a share cash for all of ARGOSystems'
shares, the companies said.
    Under the agreement, the Boeing subsidiary, TBC Holdings
Corp, will begin the tender offer promptly. If at least 90 pct
of the shares are not tendered, the offer will be prorated to
49 pct, the companies said.
    ARGOSystems has granted Boeing an option to buy 1,238,311
shares or 18.5 pct of the outstanding stock for 37 dlrs a
share, they said.
    Also, Bill May, chairman of ARGOSystems, and three other
officers have granted Boeing an option to buy their shares,
another 8.9 pct of the outstanding stock, for 37 dlrs a share.
    ARGOSystems makes equipment to monitor and analyze military
communications signals, electronic warfare equipment to monitor
and jam radar signals and signal processing systems.
    For the nine months ended March 31, 1987, ARGOSystems
reported earnings more than doubled to 6.3 mln dlrs or 95 cts a
share from 3.1 mln dlrs or 46 cts. The year-ago period included
a 2.2 mln dlr charge from a writedown of securities. Sales rose
23.5 pct to 70.9 mln dlrs.
    Sales are expected to exceed 100 mln dlrs for the fiscal
year ending June 30, the companies said in a joint statement.
    The company's backlog is currently more than 180 mln dlrs,
they said. It has about 1,200 employees.
    About 30 pct of ARGOSystems' business comes from
international customers.
    "ARGOSystems is a clear leader in its field. This
association will expand our overall activities and
significantly enhance our ability to compete in the defense
electronics area," Boeing president Frank Shrontz said in a
statement.
    ARGOSystems will operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of
Boeing Co.
    The merger following the tender offer will be subject to
approval by ARGOSystems shareholders, the companies said.
    The tender offer and merger are subject to customary
conditions and expiration of the Hart-Scott-Rodino notification
waiting period, they said.

American motorists bought 16,524,000 used
cars last year at an average cost of 5,833 dlrs each for a
total market of 96.4 billion dlrs, according to a yearly study
by the Hertz Corp.
    The study also showed an increase in used car sales of
about 600,000 units over 1985 volumes while the average price
rose about 400 dlrs.
    But the survey said the typical used car that changed hands
in 1986 was slightly newer at 4.5 years old and 41,140 miles
than in the prior year, when such a car had run 45,270 miles
and was 4.6 years old.
    "The sample shows that retail sales volume for used cars
turned up after two years of decline," said Leigh Smith, a
Hertz Corp. spokesman.
    "And while costs of ownership went up to 25.5 cents a mile
for used cars from 25.05 cents in 1985, they remain 47 pct
under the estimated 48.5 cents a mile cost to own and operate a
new car."
    The increase in activity appeared to be linked to the
record market for new cars, which passed 11.4 mln domestic and
imported models last year because of the unprecedented cut-rate
loan incentive packages offered by the Detroit-based automakers
and changes in U.S. tax laws.
    The incentive campaigns were largely sparked by General
Motors Corp <GM> in an attempt to reverse its slipping share of
the American car market.

Hospital Corp of America said it
received financing commitments of about 1.9 billion dlrs to pay
for its previously announced reorganization.
     Hospital Corp said under the reorganization, over 100
hospitals will be spun off to a new, independent company owned
by an employee stock ownership plan, ESOP, for 1.8 billion dlrs
in cash.
    Hospital Corp said in addition to the cash payment, it will
also receive preferred stock and warrants to purchase up to 34
pct of the fully diluted stock of the new company.
   
    According to Hospital Corp, the transaction is expected to
be completed in the third quarter of the year, and proceeds
will be used to reduce Hospital Corp's debt and to repurchase
Hospital Corp common shares.
     Hospital Corp said the 100 hospitals to be acquired by the
new company had net revenues totaling about 1.5 mln dlrs in
1986.
    Hospital Corp further said the ESOP would initially own
99.5 pct of the outstanding common stock of the new company or
about 51 pct on a fully diluted basis.
   
    Hospital Corp said the new company's management would
initially purchase one-half of one pct of the common stock of
the new company, with incentive plans providing management the
opportunity to earn up to 10 pct of the stock.
    According to Hospital Corp, institutions purchasing debt of
the new company will receive warrants for the remaining five
pct of the new company's fully diluted common stock.
    Hospital Corp said Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc has agreed to
provide bridge financing, or to find buyers for debt of the new
company, for an amount of up to 956 mln dlrs.
   
    The financing will comprise 270 mln dlrs of senior
unsecured ESOP debt and 686 mln dlrs of unsecured subordinated
financing for the new company, Hospital Corp said.
    Additionally, Wells Fargo Bank NA has agreed to syndicate
up to 940 mln dlrs of secured bank financing, comprising a 400
mln dlr revolving credit loan and a 540 mln dlr separate ESOP
term loan, Hospital Corp said.
    Wells Fargo has committed itself to fund an aggregate 400
mln dlrs of these loans, Hospital Corp said.
    Hospital Corp said it will not guarantee any of the debt.

Pay N' Pak Stores Inc said it received
two proposals in response to its previously announced
solicitation of potential buyers for the company.
    The company said it is evaluating the proposals from Paul
Bilzerian and from a third party which is active in the
leveraged buyout field but which Pay N' Pak declined to
identify.
    It said the Bilzerian proposal calls for shareholders to
receive on a blended basis 16.67 dlrs in cash and 3.30 dlrs in
liquidation value of cumulative exchangeable redeemable
preferred stock for each common share.
   
    Pay N' Pak said the second proposal is structured as a
merger in which each holder would receive a combination of
17.50 dlrs in cash and 2.50 dlrs in liquidation value of 13-1/2
pct cumulative preferred.
    The company said the dividend on the preferred offered by
Bilzerian would be set so that in the opinion his financial
advisor and the company's financial advisor the preferred would
trade in the public market at its liquidation value.
    Dividends on the preferred could be paid at the option of
the surviving corporation in cash or additional shares of
preferred for the first five years, it added..
   
    Pay N' Pak said Bilzerian's proposal is subject to a
physical inventory of merchandise at June 30. Bilzerian did not
provide details with respect to financing of his proposal,
which is not subject to a financing condition.
    The company said dividends on the preferred being offered
in the second proposal would be paid in additional preferred in
the first three years and the preferred would be redeemed in
years 12 and 13.
    It said the second offer is contingent on the arrangement
of financing, adding the party making the offer is confident of
its ability to obtain the balance of the financing.
   
    Pay N' Pak said the second proposal is conditioned upon a
satisfactory agreement with the company's management regarding
its equity participation in the new company.
    The second party anticipates executing a letter of intent
when it delivers its financing commitment to the Pay N' Pak
board that would incorporate an expense reinbursement and
option arrangement, the company said.

Representatives of major U.K. Based banks
are meeting here today to consider a new plan for reducing the
cost of financing British exports guaranteed by the Export
Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD), senior banking sources
said.
    The plan is being developed in conjunction with the ECGD
and the Bank of England.
    Neither the ECGD nor the Bank of England would comment on
the plan. However, bankers said one of the main points under
discussion is a plan to refinance the bulk of the ECGD's medium
term credit portfolio in the international capital markets.
    The proposals involve introducing a set of interest margins
on ECGD backed debt of 5/16 to 7/8 pct, depending on the size
and maturity of the credit and the currency.
    The banks are likely to push for a higher margin. Bankers
said that while these rates would reduce a bank's return they
would still be more than those proposed about a year ago when
the government attempted unsuccessfully to initiate another
cost reduction plan.
    At the same time, the banks would be expected to allow the
ECGD to realise additional savings by refinancing existing
government backed credit in the capital markets.
    On credits that are refinanced an original lender would
receive a residual margin of 7/16 pct for loans up to 10 mln
stg and 3/16 pct on larger transactions.

Italian fashion conglomerate Benetton
Group Spa <BTOM.MI> expects its net profit to rise to around

Palmeri, managing director of Benetton Group, said.
    Palmeri told a presentation here that sales should increase
to between 1,280 and 1,300 billion lire in 1987 from 1,079
billion in 1986, of which foreign sales were expected to take
up 850 billion lire.
    Benetton finance director Carlo Gilardi said the company
was planning to diversify further into the financial services
sector and would also expand into the shoe business.
    Benetton expanded into financial services mainly to speed
up the development of its own systems, Gilardi said. Benetton
has 400 sub-contractors and 600 distributor companies which
created a demand for such services. "But we do not plan to
abandon our traditional business," Gilardi said.
    Benetton plans to expand further outside Italy, especially
in the Far East. Talks are under way over a possible joint
venture with the Soviet Union and with South Korea.
    Palmeri said Benetton plans to list its shares in
Frankfurt, London, New York and Tokyo as part of its global

Congressional budget negotiators may 
reach an agreement this week on a 1988 budget plan, House and
Senate Budget Committee sources said.
    They held out hope that an agreement can be hammered out,
especially over the thorny issues of taxes and defence spending
levels.
    "It may come this week," a Senate source said. "They are
making progress," a House source said about back room
negotiations.
    Despite these new notes of optimism, earlier hopes for
quick agreement had been dashed when negotiators stalled.      

    House and Senate negotiators, working on different budgets,
have been stymied over proposals for new taxes and defence
spending levels. Both measures seek 18 billion dlrs in new
taxes in 1988, but the Senate proposes nearly 119 billion dlrs
in taxes over a four year span, while the House calls for only
57 billion dlrs over three years.
    The Senate plan would allocate about seven billion dlrs a
year for defence, a proposal not in the House plan which calls
for 1988 defence spending levels nearly eight billion dlrs
under the Senate plan.         
    The two sides have not had a formal negotiating meeting
since May 13. Both House and Senate would have to approve a
final compromise budget, which would be the working U.S. budget
for fiscal 1988, starting Oct. 1.
     Although the congressional budget proposes tax levels, the
actual approval of specific tax plans must be implemented
through legislationd rafted by the House Ways and Means
Committee and Senate Finance Committee which have been cool to
the idea of higher taxes.

The elimination of price limits on
precious metals contracts trading at the Commodity Exchange in
New York appears to be having little effect on the market,
analysts said.
    "There is nothing apparent from the change," said William
O'Neill, director of futures research at Elders Futures Inc.
"The market has not approached the old price limits and trading
is relative quiet, in narrow ranges," he added.
    Gold futures, which previously had a limit of 25 dlrs on
market moves in most back months, were about 7.00 dlrs weaker
in the nearby contracts amid thin conditions, traders said.
    On May 5, COMEX did away with price limits on the two
contracts following spot after a volatile market in silver
futures at the end of April caused severe disruptions.
    During the last week of April, silver futures traded up and
down the price limit in the back months, causing traders to
rush into the spot contract to offset those moves, analysts
said.  As a result, Elders' O'Neill said, there was much
confusion, many unmatched trades, and large losses.
    The COMEX fined Elders Futures and three other large firms
a total of 100,000 dlrs for failure to resolve unmatched trades
in a timely manner.
    Silver futures were trading about 30-40 cts weaker in the
nearby contracts amid quiet trading today.
    O'Neill said the elimination of price limits on all COMEX
metals futures would add caution to trading since all contracts
could move any distance.
    "This is amore realistic approach because the metals market
is a 24 hours market and prices can move without limit,"
O'Neill said.
    Paul Cain, a vice president at Shearson Lehman Brothers,
said the elimination of price limits will cut back on panic
buying or selling  and contribute to more orderly markets.

Genentech Inc is suffering only a
temporary setback following a U.S. agency decision to withhold
a recommendation on its genetically-produced drug which is used
to treat heart attacks in progress, industry sources and
analysts said.
    "When TPA (the drug) first came on the scene, the projected
time scale for approval was 1990," said Sam Milstein, a
scientist and industry consultant.
    "So even with the new delay that has arisen, in all
likelihood the drug will be approved prior to initial
projections," he added.
    Last Friday, an advisory committee at the Food and Drug
Administration, FDA, withheld a recommendation on Genentech's
tissue plasminogen activator, a drug called Activase.
    Athough it supported Genentech's claim that the drug
dissolves blood clots, the FDA said it wanted data that showed
the treatment benefits heart-attack victims.
    "We will be talking to the FDA as soon as possible to ask
specifically what they are looking for," a Genentech
spokeswoman said. She said the company had data that showed
improvement in the heart muscle after the drug was administered
but had not included it in the FDA filing.
 
    Industry analysts also said the 12 point drop in the
company's stock to 37-1/4 was largely expected in light of the
speculative nature of the biotechnology companies whose
fortunes often depend on the success of an important drug.
    "In larger pharmaceutical companies each product does not
have as much overall significance. But this is very important
to Genentech," said Robert Riley, a senior consultant at Arthur
D. Little Inc.
    Some estimated that Genentech could see as much as 1.5
billion dlrs from the drug. But with each delay, others can
enter the market and catch up to Genentech's lead.

    Industry sources pointed out that KabiVitrum, in an
alliance with Hoechst AG <HFAG.F>, won a recommendation for its
streptokinase drug on the same day Genentech's application was
delayed. Streptokinase, an enzyme-based drug, is also used to
treat heart attack victims.
    In addition, Milstein said that Beecham Group Plc <BHAM.L>
has a drug called Eminase which is "the most likely competitor
to TPA," and from a clinical standpoint, nearly identical.
Beecham's drug has been approved for use in Germany and is
awaiting approval in the U.K., he added.
     Streptokinase was difficult to administer to heart attack
victims because it would dissolve before it reached the heart.
Another method, which involved pumping the drug directly into
the heart through a tube, proved difficult when a heart attack
was in progress. TPA was seen as a savior since it was easier
to administer and worked quickly.
    But new developments have made streptokinase more effective
and easier to administer, becoming a potential threat to
Genentech's grasp on the TPA market. And if that wasn't enough,
about 30 other biotech companies are quickly developing TPA in
Genentech's path.
 
    "Genentech's advantage is being first in the market," said
industry consultant Scott King, formerly an analyst with
Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. "They'll be the first
approved but then they'll face competition after one or two
years."
    The company may also face patent pressures for its drug. It
is currently about to go to court with Beecham Group in the
U.K. in a patent dispute. And while its patent is pending in
the U.S., many analysts expect the company to face some suits
as soon as the patent is issued, a potentially more harmful
situation than any temporary setback in the FDA.

Middle South Utilities Inc said the

ruling blocking a portion of the utility's retail rates.
    In February, the state court had returned to state
regulators a case involving the recovery of Grand Gulf one
nuclear power plant costs at the rate of 28 mln dlrs per month.
These rates, some of which were deferred for future phase-in,
were granted by the state regulators in September 1985 based on
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission allocation of the power
plant's cost among Middle South's subsidiaries.
    Middle South said one condition of the stay is the posting
of a bond that is suitable to the Mississippi Supreme Court.   
 Middle South said the Supreme Court stay brings stability to
Mississippi Power and Light's situation and "removes the
possibility of MP and L's imminent insolvancy while the case is

Canada's softwood lumber will become
unprofitable for some forest product producers if prices
decline to about 175 U.S. dlrs per thousand board feet of two
by four inch lumber from current levels of about 195 U.S. dlrs,
Canadian Forest Industry Council chairman Adam Zimmerman told
reporters.
    Zimmerman reiterated profitability has been hurt by a move
by Canadian negotiators to impose last January a 15 pct export
tax on softwood lumber shipped to the U.S. in exchange for a
U.S. lumbermen's lobby dropping its request for a countervail
duty.
    "I think that there has been a falling off in the market, so
I think there is a moderate slow down in the price now,"
Zimmerman said at a media briefing.
    Zimmerman said the adverse impact from lower U.S. lumber
product prices would be felt by lumber mills in eastern Canada
first, migrating westward.
    "The country has swallowed a time bomb and it will go off
when times get tough," Zimmerman said.
    He also said the federal government should maintain the
existing 15 pct export tax and not allow provinces to offset
the tax with increased provincial fees for cutting lumber.

Computer Associates International Inc's
800 mln dlr merger with Uccel Corp <UCE> will eliminate its
strongest rival, but the company still faces stiff competition
from International Business Machines Corp <IBM>, Wall Street
analysts said.
     "IBM is still the ruling force in mainframe systems
software," said Scott Smith, an analyst with Donaldson Lufkin
and Jenrette.
    "But the combination of the two companies will clearly
present a much stronger front," he said.
    Besides IBM, "Computer Associates will be far and away the
most powerful company in the field," added E.F. Hutton analyst
Terence Quinn.
    That field is a segment of the market known as system
utilities, or software packages that boost the productivity of
a company's data processing facilities by increasing the speed,
power and efficiency of large mainframe computers.
    The merger of Uccel and Computer Associates combines the
two biggest systems utilities suppliers other than IBM.
Analysts said the remaining players are mostly small firms that
will find the competition much harder than in the past.
    For Computer Associates, the merger with Uccel caps a
six-year acquisition campaign that has vaulted the Garden City,
N.Y.-based company to the top of the software industry.
    When the deal is completed sometime in August, the
company's revenues will exceed 450 mln dlrs, pushing it past 
Microsoft Corp <MFST> as the world's largest independent
software vendor.
    Computer Associates founder and chairman Charles B. Wang
took the company public in 1981, and since then he has bought
15 companies and boosted annual sales from 18.5 mln to 309.3
mln dlrs for the year ended March 31.
    Liemandt took charge of Wyly, sold off its non-computer
businesses and decided that it would focus solely on mainframe
computer software. In 1984, the company was renamed Uccel Corp.
    Liemandt, who said he will leave the company after the
merger is completed, also turned to acquisitions for growth.
    On the last day of 1986, Uccel completed the buyouts of six
companies for a total of about 60 mln dlrs.
    For 1986, it earned 17.0 mln dlrs, or 1.01 dlrs a share, on
sales of 141.5 mln dlrs.
    The agreement took industry analysts by surprise, largely
because the companies had been such bitter rivals. Also,
Dallas-based Uccel had engineered a strong comeback from the
dark days of 1982, when, as Wyly Corp, it lost 7.7 mln dlrs, or
56 cts a share.
   At that time, Wyly owned a potpourri of 13 different
businesses, only three of which were involved in computer
software. In 1983, Walter Haefner, a Swiss financier and a
major Wyly investor, lured Gregory J. Liemandt away from his
job as chairman of General Electric Co's <GE> computer services
unit.
    Computer Associates' Wang and Uccel's Liemandt said at a
news conference that the merger would give computer users a
single source for a wide range of software products.
    In addition to system utilities, Computer Associates also
sell products for microcomputers, while Uccel has made inroads
in the applications software market, where analysts said it has
been successful with accounting and banking systems.
    Wang said Computer Associates would continue to support and
enhance both companies' product lines, but noted that the
company will eventually weed out duplicate offerings. He said
about 20 pct of the companies' products overlap.
    Analysts said the merger would dilute the holdings of
current Computer Associates shareholders by about 10 pct. But
they joined Wang in forecasting that the deal will not dilute
Computer Associates' earnings for the current fiscal year.
    Quinn of E.F. Hutton said Wang has a proven track record of
completing acquisitions without earnings dilution. Therefore,
he said he would not change his 1988 earnings estimate of 1.05
dlrs a share.
    Wang said he would look closely at the combined operations
of the two companies and cut duplication in sales, marketing
and research and development.
    Analysts said Computer Associates paid a premium for Uccel.
Based on Friday's closing price, the company will swap 47.50
dlrs worth of its stock for each Uccel share, which is nearly
33 times Uccel's 1987 estimated earnings of 1.45 dlrs a share.
    Stephen T. McClellan of Merrill Lynch Research said most
software companies are currently valued at about 20 times
per-share earnings. But the analyst said Uccel was worth the
premium because of its earnings potential and customer base.

    Wang said Haefner, the Swiss investor, would hold about 25
pct of Computer Associates stock after the merger. He currently
owns 58 pct of Uccel.
    The executive said the merger would not alter his target of
maintaining sales and earnings growth of 30 pct to 35 pct.
    In addition, he said he expects no problems in having the
deal cleared by the antitrust division of the U.S. Justice
Department.
    Uccel's Liemandt declined to say what he will do after the
merger, but he did not rule out working together with Wang.

Traders recently returned from West Africa
say some producers there are dismayed by the ineffective action
so far by the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) buffer
stock manager on buffer stock purchases.
    One trader said some West African producers are annoyed the
Buffer Stock manager is not playing his part as required by the
International Cocoa Pact to stabilise prices from current lows.
    So far, only 21,000 tonnes of second hand cocoa have been
taken up for buffer stock purposes and this, traders noted,
only on an intermittent basis.
    They noted the purchases, of 8,000 tonnes in the first week
he bought and 13,000 in the second, are well short of the
limitations of no more than 5,000 tonnes in one day and 20,000
in one week which the cocoa agreement places on him.
    The traders recently returned from West Africa say
producers there are unhappy about the impact on cocoa prices so
far, noting producing countries are part of the international
cocoa pact and deserve the same treatment as consumers.
    London traders say terminal market prices would have to
gain around 300 stg a tonne to take the ICCO 10-day average
indicator to its 1,935 sdr per tonne midway point (or reference
price).
    However, little progress has been made in that direction,
and the 10-day average is still well below the 1,600 sdr lower
intervention level at 1,562.87 from 1,569.46 previously.
    The buffer stock manager may announce today he will be
making purchases tomorrow, although under the rules of the
agreement such action is not automatic, traders said.
    Complaints about the inaction of the buffer stock manager
are not confined to West African producers, they observed.

Canada's corporate debt burden is at its
lowest point in five years but still exceeds pre-1981 recession
levels, said a study by Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce
<CM.TO>.
    The bank said the debt-equity ratio for all Canadian
companies, excluding financial corporations, now averages 1.50,
down from 1.70 in 1982, but higher than 1.47 in 1980.
    "Five years of uninterrupted economic growth in Canada and
the strength of the Canadian bond and stock markets, despite
recent corrections, have led to a marked improvement in the
financial health of most Canadian corporations," the bank said.
   
    The bank said that manufacturing, construction,
transportation, utility and service industries had improved
their debt-equity ratios to 1977 levels. Mining, oil and gas
companies were not performing as well due to low commodity
prices, the bank added.
    Canadian corporate financial ratios are also stronger than
those in the U.S., the bank said. It said the 1981-82 recession
led some Canadian companies to downsize and use resulting
savings to cut floating rate debt, and others to shift to
equity from debt financing.

The elimination of limits on daily price
fluctuations for metals futures contracts traded on the
Commodity Exchange, COMEX, appears to be having little effect
on the market, analysts said.
    "There is nothing apparent from the change," said William
O'Neill, director of futures research at Elders Futures Inc.
    "The market has not approached the old price limits and
trading is relative quiet, in narrow ranges," he said.
    On May 5, COMEX eliminated price limits on the two
contracts following each spot delivery in gold, silver, copper
and aluminum futures after a review of its clearing operations,
which were severely tested by a volatile market in silver
futures at the end of April. COMEX announced Friday the lifting
of all daily limits, effective today.
    Gold futures, which previously had a limit of 25 dlrs per
ounce in most back months, were about 7.00 dlrs weaker in the
nearby contracts amid thin volume conditions, traders said.
    Silver futures, previously limited at 50 cents in most back
months, were trading about 30-40 cts weaker in the nearby
contracts amid quiet trading today.
    During the last week of April, silver futures often traded
at the daily allowable limit amid concerns about inflation, the
dollar, and other factors. Traders rushed into the spot, or
unlimited, contract to offset those moves, analysts said.
    As a result, O'Neill said, there was much confusion, many
unmatched trades, and large losses for some traders.
    The COMEX fined four large firms a total of 100,000 dlrs
for failure to resolve unmatched trades in a timely manner.
    Paul Cain, a vice president at Shearson Lehman Brothers,
said the elimination of price limits will cut back on panic
buying or selling and contribute to more orderly markets.
    O'Neill added that the elimination of daily limits would
add caution to trading.
    "This is a more realistic approach because the metals
market is a 24 hours market and prices can move without limit,"
O'Neill said.

Federal Deposit Insurance Corp
Chairman L. William Seidman told a bankers' meeting he thinks
more banks will follow Citicorp <CCI> and Chase Manhattan <CMB>
in building up their reserves to meet Latin American debt
problems.
    Seidman, speaking to an American Bankers Association trade
conference, said he did not think regulators would play as big
a role in encouraging banks to build up their loan-loss
reserves as the marketplace would.
   
    My guess is that we as regulators won't become the key
factor. I think the market system will get most of the other
banks to follow suit," Seidman told some 3,000 executives
attending the ABA's National Operations and Automation
Conference.
    In the past two weeks, Citicorp has added three billion
dlrs and Chase Manhattan, 1.6 billion dlrs, to their loan-loss
reserves.
   
    "I think that most banks are going to find it irresistible
to move forward on the same type of reserving because, if they
don't, their future earnings will be penalized as they hold up
their reserves on a quarter-by-quarter basis," Seidman said.
    He said Chase and Citibank, by setting aside huge amounts
at one time,  have put their losses behind them and will show
much better future earnings.
    That, he said, will put pressure on more banks to follow
suit.

Flooding in the Red River on the
Texas/Oklahoma border has shut down the Basin Pipeline, a
24-inch pipeline that transports as much as 300,000 barrels per
day of sweet and sour crudes from Texas to Cushing, Okla, a
Texaco Pipeline Co spokesman confirmed.
    "The water is rushing by so fast that we can't get any
divers down to assess the damage but there is some possibility
that the pipeline could be up by the end of the week," a company
source said.
    The pipeline transmits roughly two-thirds sour crude and
one-third sweet crude oil from the Midland, Texas region.
    Texaco sources said that if the pipeline service is
restored by Friday there would be little problem in restoring
oil which has been lost to the flood.
    "But if the pipeline is down more than 10 days it will be
difficult to make up without prorationing and we would not like
to proration this pipeline, if we don't have to."
    The Basin Pipeline is jointly owned by Atlantic Richfield
Corp <ARC>, Shell Oil Co, a subsidiary of the Royal Dutch/Shell
Group <RD> and Texaco Inc <TX>, which is the pipeline's
operator.
     Peter Beutel, analyst at Elders Futures Inc, said crude
oil futures contracts on New York Mercantile Exchange rose to
new highs this afternoon following news of the pipeline break.
    July crude futures of West Texas Intermediate traded up to
19.60 dlrs a barrel, a rise of more than 20 cts.
    Cash market prices also firmed on the news with sellers of
WTI raising offers to 19.60 dlrs a barrel.
    Sour crudes, which would be most affected by the pipeline
shutdown, however, were slow to react to the news with West
Texas Sour and Alaska North Slope holding 50 cts to one dlr a
barrel below WTI, respectively.
    Dan Stevens, manager of public and government affairs at
Texaco, said the company hopes to fix the pipeline in five days
but that will depend on when the water level of the Red River
recedes. There is already evidence that the water level is
dropping and it appears the rain has stopped in the area
affecting the pipeline, Stevens said.
    He said the segment of the pipeline that was damaged was
underground and at a distance from the Red River that flooded.
The pipeline runs over the Red River and under the subsoil
nearby, according to Stevens. He said some of this subsoil was
apparently washed away.
   
    The potential for environmental damage is being downplayed
at this time despite the volume of oil that runs through this
line.
    Texaco's Stevens said that aerial surveillance has not
found any crude on the water in the river or in Lake Texoma,
which is nearby.

Allegis Corp may file its plan of
recapitalization with the Securities and Exchange Commission
later this week, a company spokesman said.
    The spokesman also said the company has no comment on
Coniston Partners plan to carry out its solicitation of
consents from shareholders to remove Allegis directors.
    Coniston proposes replacing the board of directors with its
own candidates and then selling off one or more units of
Allegis. Allegis, apparently in response to takeover activity,
announced a sweeping recapitalization plan, which will give
shareholders 60 dlrs per share.
    Allegis shares came under pressure from institutional
selling today. The stock slipped 1-3/8 to 85-1/8 on volume of
more than 1.6 mln shares. Traders said there was also
arbitrage-related buying.
    PaineWebber Group analyst Edward Starkman said institutions
and other long-term holders may want to cash in their gains
instead of waiting for the company's special dividend, which
would be taxed at a higher rate. The recapitalization is
subject to shareholder and other approvals.
    Starkman said he believes Coniston may still have a chance
to win the battle for control of Allegis' board room, despite
the recapitalization plan.
    Coniston Partners would not comment on the recapitalization
plan.
    "We said a week ago, and we say it again today that the way
to maximize value for shareholders is to see these companies
traded as independent companies," said Keith Gollust, one of
the partners.
    Allegis owns United Air Lines, Hertz rental cars, and
Westin and Hilton International hotels.
    Allegis' recapitalization plan does not entail the sale of
any of those businesses, which its management claims are
necessary to its travel services strategy. The recapitalization
plan would add three billion dlrs in debt to its balance sheet.
    Some Wall Street analysts believe such a move could be
risky since the airline, as well as other travel businesses,
are dependant on the strength of the economy.
    "They've become sort of a super cyclical company," Starkman
said. The hotels and car rental business represents "no
diversification. It just makes it worse."
    Traders and analysts who believe Coniston's effort may have
a chance believe that Allegis management is not giving
shareholders full value. After receiving the dividend,
shareholders will still hold their stock. Arbitragers and
analysts valued the recapitalization in the upper 80s to 100
dlrs per share.
    Breakup values for the company estimated on Wall Street
exceed 110 dlrs per share.

Rep. Mike Synar said today that while
President Reagan is ready to use military force to protect
Kuwait tankers in the Gulf, the United States is ill-prepared
at home to deal with a new energy crisis.
    Synar, Democrat of Oklahoma, made his remarks in comments
on a study by the General Accounting Office (GAO) on the U.S.
participation in the 1985 test of the emergency oil sharing
program of the International Energy Agency.
    The IEA, an alliance of 21 oil consuming countries, was
formed after the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo to find ways to deal
with any future oil cutoff.
    Synar said, "the president is prepared to take military
action to protect Kuwaiti oil tankers but has been unwilling to
take less dangerous, equally-important action to prepare our
nation for the next energy crisis."
    Reagan said the U.S. military would protect Kuwaiti oilers
to assure the West of a continuing supply of Middle East oil,
increasingly being threatened by the Iranian-Iraqi war. Synar,
who asked for the GAO report after criticism of U.S. action in
a previous IEA test, said the United States successfully
advocated a test limited to training participants in oil
sharing procedures and the system's mechanical aspects.

Cominco Ltd said it
expects to meet today with two of five United Steelworkers of

B.C. lead-zinc mine, a Cominco spokesman said.
    It had no meeting scheduled with the other three striking
locals, which rejected a tentative three-year contract
Saturday, Cominco spokesman Richard Fish said.
    Fish said the pact that was rejected contained a cost of
living increase tied to the Canadian consumer price index, but
no wage increase. With 81 pct of the membership voting, 54.5
pct voted no and 45.5 pct voted yes, the union said.
    The three locals represent about 2,600 production and
maintenance workers, while the remaining two locals cover about
600 office and technical workers.
    The office and technical workers last negotiated May 21.
Production at Trail and Kimberley has been shut down since the
strike began May 9 and Cominco has had to declare force
majeure, which means the company may be unable to honor
contracts for products from the smelter and mine.
    Each of the five locals have separate contracts, all of
which expired April 30, but the main issues are similar.
    The Trail smelter, about 400 miles east of Vancouver,
produced 240,000 long tons of zinc and 110,000 long tons of
lead last year. The Sullivan mine at Kimberley, about 450 miles
east of Vancouver, produced 2.2 mln long tons of ore last year,
most for processing at the Trail smelter.

Cominco Ltd said it
expects to meet today with two of five United Steelworkers of
America locals on strike at its Trail smelter and Kimberley,
B.C. lead-zinc mine, a Cominco spokesman said.
    It had no meeting scheduled with the other three striking
locals, which rejected a tentative three-year contract
Saturday, Cominco spokesman Richard Fish said.
    Fish said the pact that was rejected contained a cost of
living increase tied to the Canadian consumer price index, but
no wage increase. With 81 pct of the membership voting, 54.5
pct voted no and 45.5 pct voted yes, the union said.
    The three locals represent about 2,600 production and
maintenance workers, while the remaining two locals cover about
600 office and technical workers.
    The office and technical workers last negotiated May 21.
Production at Trail and Kimberley has been shut down since the
strike began May 9 and Cominco has had to declare force
majeure, which means the company may be unable to honor
contracts for products from the smelter and mine.
    Each of the five locals have separate contracts, all of
which expired April 30, but the main issues are similar.
    The Trail smelter, about 400 miles east of Vancouver,
produced 240,000 long tons of zinc and 110,000 long tons of
lead last year. The Sullivan mine at Kimberley, about 450 miles
east of Vancouver, produced 2.2 mln long tons of ore last year,
most for processing at the Trail smelter.
    The smelter also produced cadmium, bismuth and indium.

share bid made last Wednesday by Union Pacific Corp (UNP), 
analysts said.
    "The offer is inadequate," said Douglas Augenthaler, an
analyst with E.F. Hutton, noting that it does not represent the
needed premium over the company's fundamental value based on
earnings estimates.
    USPCI, which has 8.7 mln shares outstanding, was trading at
48-1/8, down 3/8.
    USPCI vice president of finance Larry Shelton said he could
not comment on the adequacy of the offer or on when the board
would meet to consider it.
    Augenthaler said that while USPCI was trading at only 34
dlrs a share at the time of the takeover bid, its announcement
that same day of higher earnings expectations changed its
value. USPCI said its second quarter earnings would exceed
analysts expectations of 24 to 30 cts a share.
    At that price, USPCI could maintain a stock price in the
low 40s, Augenthaler said.
    Hutton revised its 1987 earnings estimate for the waste
management concern to 1.40 dlrs a share from 1.20 dlrs on the
announcment, he said. It lifted its 1988 projection to 1.90
dlrs a share from 1.70 dlrs.
    In addition, analysts said the hazardous waste management
business holds significant growth potential. The industry has
grown from 16 to 35 pct over the last five years, based on
earnings per share, said Jeffrey Klein, an analyst with Kidder
Peabody and Co. The industry is expected to continue growing at
15 to 35 pct over the next five years, he said.
    Augenthaler said the 43-dlr-a-share offer, or 375 mln dlrs
total, would be a bargain for Union Pacific. The transportation
and energy company would both gain entry into a profitable
business and win cost-control benefits, he said.
    "Union Pacific has what are rumored to be some fairly
signficant environmmental problems of its own," he said.
    Herb Mee Jr., president of Beard Oil Co (BEC), which holds
a 30.4 pct stake in USPCI, said last week Union Pacific's offer
was "grossly inadequate."

A quickly growing Texas-based
distributor of electronics products offered 240 mln dlrs
for Crazy Eddie Inc <crzy>, the leading New York City
electronics retailer, or one dlr per share more than its
founder has bid.
    The 8-dlr-a-share offer by Entertainment Marketing Inc <em>
for Crazy Eddie comes less than two weeks after founder Eddie
Antar and a firm controlled by the Belzbergs of Canada
announced a bid to take the 32-store Crazy Eddie chain private.
    Analysts said Entertainment Marketing, whose revenues and
profits quadrupled in 1986, may be looking to break into the
highly competitive New York City retail market for consumer
electronics, the nation's biggest, at a time the fortunes of
electronics retailers have sagged.
    The analysts questioned whether Houston-based Entertainment
Marketing, founded by a former electronics retailer but whose
present buinesses are primarily as wholesale distributors, had
the management expertise for retailing or was merely trying to
drive up the price of the Crazy Eddie shares it already owns.
    "I have mixed feelings," said analyst Dennis Telzrow of
Eppler, Geurin and Turner, a Dallas brokerage. "On the one hand
it's probably a cheap price. On the other hand, does
Entertainment Marketing have the management talent to run it
and will the Crazy Eddie people leave?"
    "It's a risky strategy for Entertainment Marketing," said
analyst Eliot Laurence of Wessels Arnold and Henderson, a
Minneapolis brokerage. "Electronics retailing is very management
concentrated; they'd want to keep Crazy Eddie's management in
place."
    Laurence said that, since Entertainment Marketing already
owns 4.3 percent of Crazy Eddie's 31.3 million shares, it may
be trying to get the Antar-Belzberg group to increase its
7-dlr-a-share offer.
    Shares of Crazy Eddie, which have jumped from the high
4-dlr range to above 7 dlrs since the Antar-Belzberg bid was
announced May 20, rose another 50 cents Monday to 8.375 a share
in over-the- counter trading. 
    Antar, the reclusive founder of the chain in the New York
City, Philadelphia and Connecticut areas, said last month that
his group controlled 14 percent of Crazy Eddie's shares.
    A Crazy Eddie spokesman said the company's board has taken
no decision on the Antar-Belzberg offer, worth some 187 mln dlrs
since they own more shares than Entertainment Marketing. He
would not comment on the new offer.
    Entertainment Marketing sells computer products such as
disk drives and other, often discounted electronics goods to
retailers, primarily in the southwest, and directly to
consumers by cable television.
    In fiscal 1986, ending last January, its revenues rose to
87.9 mln dlrs from 21.3 mln dlrs the previous year. Net profit
went to 3.2 mln dlrs from 750,000 dlrs in 1985.
    Entertainment Marketing, whose chief executive officer,
Elias Zinn, once ran an electronics retailing business, said in
a statement it had committed 50 mln dlrs toward the purchase
of Crazy Eddie and had retained Dean Witter Reynolds Inc to
assist in financing the balance.
    Analyst Telzerow estimated that the company would have to
borrow about 100 mln dlrs to complete the proposed buyout since
Crazy Eddie has cash and other assets worth about the same
amount.
    Shares of Entertainment Marketing were up 12.5 cents Monday
to 9.50.

Security Pacific Corp said it intends
to add 500 mln dlrs to its provision for credit losses during
the second quarter, a move that will result in a loss for the
period of about 175 mln dlrs.
    The company added, however, that it now expects to post a
profit for the full year of about 150 mln dlrs.
    Security Pacific said the reserve is specifically related
to its loans to the developing world.
    Security Pacific, which has assets of about 64 billion
dlrs, reported 1986 net income of 385.9 mln dlrs. Last year it
posted second quarter net income of 93.5 mln.
    In making the announcement, Security Pacific said the extra
500 mln dlrs will raise its reserve for credit losses to about
1.3 billion dlrs, or 2.8 pct of total loans and leases
outstanding.
    It said the amount of reserves allocated to Lesser
Developed Country (LDC) debt represents about one-third of the
company's total LDC debt portfolio.
    A spokesman said the company currently has LDC debt
exposure of about 1.8 billion dlrs. The company's total loan
portfolio at March 31 stood at 44.4 billion dlrs.
    The Security Pacific move follows similar provisions by
several other money center banks.
    Last month Citicorp <CCI> led the move by annoucing a three
billion dlr addition to its reserve to help bolster its
protection against uncertainties in the economic world.
    Chase Manhattan Corp <CMB> followed with a 1.6 billion dlr
addition to its credit loss reserve.
    "While our LDC debt exposure is relatively small, we think
that the LDC debt environment has been altered significantly
given the recent actions of other major financial
institutions," Security Pacific chairman Richard Flamson said
in a statement.
    Following its 500 mln dlr addition to the credit loss
reserve, its primary capital ratio at the end of the second
quarter will be about 7.4 pct, Security Pacific said.
    The company further stated that it anticipates continuing
its current dividend payment at an annual rate of 1.80 dlrs per
share.
    The company also stressed that it is not writing off loans
to the developing world but rather, adding to its reserves will
allow greater flexibility when dealing with these credits in
the future.
    Security Pacific also said it intends to play a continuing
role in meeting the needs of those countries.
    Security Pacific is the nation's sixth largest bank holding
company.

The investor group that has agreed to
buy <Computerland Corp> will likely take the leading personal
computer retailer public or sell it to other investors,
industry analysts said.
    "Now's a good time," said Joe Levy of International Data
Corp. "The personal computer industry has bottomed out and is
on the way up again," he said.
    Earlier today, closely held Computerland, the largest PC
retailing chain in the country, said it agreed to be bought by
an investor group led by E.M. Warburg Pincus and Co, New York.
    Neither Computerland, which is 96 pct owned by its founder,
William H. Millard, nor E.M. Warburg, a money management and
venture capital firm, would disclose the value of the
transaction.
    Analysts estimated that Computerland, whose 800 stores
generated 1.4 billion dlrs in sales last year, would fetch  150
mln dlrs to 250 mln dlrs. Computerland franchise owners pay
royalties averaging 5.9 pct to the parent company.
    Officials for E.M. Warburg referred all questions to
Computerland. Computerland officials could not immediately be
reached for comment.
    E.M. Warburg currently manages 1.5 billion dlrs in venture
capital funds, and its past investments have included Mattel
Inc <MAT> and the Ingersoll newspaper chain. It is also a money
manager, with 3.5 billion dlrs under management.
   Although the PC retailers are benefitting from the strong
upturn in PC sales, analysts said Computerland must make key
changes if it is to fend off advances from rivals like
Businessland Inc <BUSL.O> and Tandy Corp's <TAN> Radio Shack
stores. "The name of the game now is outbound sales forces,
customer service and customer support," said Levy of
International Data.

    Relations between Computerland and its franchise owners
have mellowed recently after Millard was forced to give up
managment control of the company in 1985.
    Ed Faber, who took over as chairman and chief executive
officer, revamped the company's royalty plan, which help quell
much of the franchisee dissent.

U.S. District Court Judge Eugene
A. Gordon said he plans to issue a decision tomorrow on
Burlington Industries Inc's request for an injunction to stop
Samjens Acquisition Corp's takeover bid for the company.
    Wall Street sources have said the outcome of the case could
be pivotal in determining the winner in the fierce takeover
battle for Burlington, the largest u.s. textile maker.
    Gordon presided over six hours of argument today by lawyers
for Burlington and Samjens, a partnership formed by Dominion
Textile Inc and New York investor Asher Edelman.
    Hearings are scheduled to continue tomorrow. A preliminary
injunction would hold up Samjens 2.47 billion dlr offer until
the case is decided.
    Burlington had previously agreed to a 2.44 billion dlr
buyout from Morgan Stanley Group Inc <MS>, one dlr per share
lower than a sweetened 77 dlr per share bid made by Samjens
last week. Burlington has not responded to the new Samjens
offer.
    Burlington has alleged in its lawsuit that Edelman and
Dominion used illegally obtained confidential information about
the company in making their takeover attempt.
 
    That information, Burlington said, was provided by James
Ammeen, a former Burlington executive, through PaineWebber
Group Inc <PWJ>. Ammeen, who had worked for Burlington for 23
years, had as many as 12 divisions with 50 pct of Burlington's
sales reporting to him. When he left Burlington in November,
1985, Burlington said he signed a contract promising never to
divulge inside information about the company.
    Burlington lawyers said shortly after he left he began
working with a PaineWebber employee on a hostile plan to
"takeover the company, dismember the company and displace its
management," Burlington lawyer Hubert Humphrey said.
    Samjens lawyers acknowledged it received information from
PaineWebber, but argued the information was public information
and could be obtained either from texitle industry analysts or
Burlington's public financial statements.
    Burlington lawyers said PaineWebber and Ammeen met with
Edelman and Dominion in November and continued to meet with
them until a couple of days before Edelman and Dominion went
public April 24 with their intention to take over the company.
Burlington lawyers claim Dominion's board decided to attempt a
takeover of Burlington after Ammeen met with the board in
February.
    Burlington lawyers said Edelman and Dominion held
discussions with PaineWebber and Ammeen about acting as
financial advisers to Samjens. But they allege talks broke off
because Painewebber and Ammeen could not satisfy Edelman and
dominion with a written statement that they did not provide
inside information.
    Lawyers for Samjens contended that Painewebber and Ammeen
withdrew as potential advisers because Burlington chairman
Frank Greenberg had called a PaineWebber executive and
threatened legal action if PaineWebber got involved in an
effort to takeover Burlilgnton.
    "The ultimate question is not the price per share or the
profit, but rather the permissable standards of conduct for
those who would takeover an American company," said burlington
lawyer Humphrey.
    Burlington lawyers also contended that Burlington, as the
largest manufacturer of denim in the United States, would be in
violation of anti-trust laws if it acquired Dominion, Canada's
largest textile maker. Dominion has denim manufacturing plants
in Georgia, which would reduce competition in the denim market,
the lawyers said.
    Samjens' lawyers discounted the concern. They said the
market for denim is more fragmented than Burlington contends
and that Burlington has the ability to switch between light
weight and heavy weight denim production as demand and price
dictate.
    Samjens lawyers also pointed to a lawsuit filed by
Burlington in Canada, in which it said it was considering a bid
for Dominion. "Surely, what would have been sauce for the goose
would have been sauce for the gander," said Sidney Rosdeitcher,
a Samjens lawyer.

The dollar's recent signs of stability
have raised hopes that its 27-month decline may be nearly over,
but most currency analysts refuse to commit themselves until
after the June 12 release of U.S. trade data for April.
    "The trade data will be a deciding factor to see if the
dollar has bottomed out," said Jim McGroarty of Discount Corp.
    Since February 1985, the dollar has nearly halved its value
against the yen and the mark as part of an officially
orchestrated campaign to make U.S. goods more competitive on
world markets and redress gaping world trade imbalances.
    On April 27, the dollar fell to a 40-year low of 137.25 yen
but has enjoyed a modest recovery over the last few weeks,
topping 145 yen today for the first time in nearly two months.
    Many economists now believe that the dollar has fallen far
enough to ease the trade deficit's drag on the U.S. economy.
    The U.S. trade gap narrowed to 13.6 billion dlrs in March
from 15.1 billion in February and is expected to show continued
improvement in April in volume, if not in real, terms.
    Keiichi Udagawa of Bank of Tokyo in New York said that if
further progress is reported, the dollar would head back up
towards 150 yen.
    "There is growing consensus that the dollar has bottomed
out for the medium term," added Tom Campbell of First National
Bank of Chicago.
    Other factors supporting this bullish view were growing
expectations that Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker would
be reappointed for a third four-year term in August, Japan's
larger-than-expected economic stimulus package last week and 
more favorably technical chart signals, analysts said.
    The dollar was also aided by Japan's moves to dampen
speculative selling in Tokyo and by reports of active central
bank intervention to support the dollar.
    The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said last week that
the U.S. monetary authorities bought more than four billion
dlrs during the February-April period -- the largest amount
since the dollar crisis of the late 1970's.
    Discount Corp's McGroarty described the Fed's intervention
volume as "impressive".
    James O'Neill of Marine Midland Bank was not so positive,
however: "the dollar has not yet bottomed out. After the trade
data are released, the dollar could fall towards 1.77 marks and
140 yen."
    Similarly, Natsuo Okada of Sumitomo Bank in New York
warned, "I don't think the dollar has bottomed out yet."
    Although the dollar could rise as high as 146.50 yen, Okada
said market impatience about the painstakingly slow decline of
the U.S. trade deficit may lead to renewed pressure.
    Currency analysts also warned about an unfavorable reaction
to the seven-nation economic Summit on June 8 to 10 in Venice,
which is likely to focus on the implementation of previous
commitments rather than yield any fresh initiatives.
    President Reagan said today, "economic policy decisions
made last year in Tokyo and at this year's meetings of Group of
Seven finance ministers in Paris and Washington cannot be
ignored or forgotten."
    "The commitments made at these meetings need to be
translated into action," he added in a speech, celebrating the
40th anniversary of the Marshall aid plan for Europe.
    Now that Tokyo has unveiled its fiscal stimulus package,
analysts expected Bonn and the dollar/mark rate to bear the
brunt of U.S. calls for further action.
    Marine Midland's O'Neill said, "pressure will build up on
Germany to take stimulative action like Japan."
    Some Japanese bank dealers warned that although the dollar
could hold above 145 yen for some months it could also come
under attack again if it seems the latest economic package is
not having much impact on Japan's economy and its trade
surplus. Reflecting a longer-term uncertainty, some some trust
banks and Japanese insurers are keeping their short dollar
positons hedged against exchange losses in their foreign
portfolios, while some others have started covering those short
positions, Japanese bank dealers said.

Deregulation of Japan's oil industry could
mean hardship for smaller firms and lead to their merging into
bigger refining and marketing groups, industry sources said.
    They said the relaxation of controls was now under review
by the Petroleum Council, an advisory panel to the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry (MITI).
    A spokesman for a major firm said, "Deregulation would bring
about a reorganization. If it's a by-product of freer
competition, we have no choice but to accept it."
    The Council is due to close its discussions on June 12.
    The sources said the Council was likely to tell MITI it
should end its 50 year-old protection of the industry. It
should cut capacity to 3.8 mln barrels per day, about 75 pct of
current capacity. Quotas should end for crude throughput and
gasoline output, and oil tariffs should be abolished.
    They said deregulation was vital to promote more
competition and efficiency, and most saw it as inevitable.
    "Deregulation is taking place everywhere. Now it's our turn
to see if we can survive cut-throat competition," said a source
at one major Japanese oil company.
    A spokesman for a smaller refiner said, "We'll have a hard
time surviving, but that's something we must go through."
    "In addition to our streamlining and efficiency programs for
the oil division, we will exert efforts towards branching out
further into other lines such as real estate and travel
agencies," he said.
    Larger companies are also streamlining. Nippon Oil Co Ltd
which had the largest share of refined products sales in the
Japanese market in fiscal 1985, cut nine pct of its refining
capacity in fiscal 1986.
    Cosmo Oil Co Ltd, the third largest seller of oil products
in 1985, cut its workforce by some 20 pct last year, a
spokesman for the company said.
    Between 1984 and 1986, on the recommendation of the
Council, 13 oil companies were integrated into 11 companies
within seven refining and marketing groups to improve the
efficiency of the industry.
    Oil industry sources said this structure was now likely to
be streamlined further into five refining groups.
    "MITI means business. It will urge the major seven groups to
merge into five to build up their muscles," a source said.
    A MITI official told

British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's
Conservatives lead the opposition Labour party by seven
percentage points in the June 11 election campaign, according
to a public opinion poll today.
    The Harris poll on the TV-AM breakfast television show gave
Thatcher's Conservative Party 42 pct, Labour 35 pct and the
centrist Alliance 21 pct.
    This was a one point drop for the Conservatives and one
point rise for the Alliance since the same organisation's
survey yesterday.
    However, a Marplan poll in the Today newspaper had the
Conservatives 11 points ahead. It gave them 44 pct, Labour 33
pct and the Alliance 21 pct.
    All poll results since the campaign began have shown the
Conservatives in the lead. An aggregate of recent surveys
showed they held a nine to 10 point lead over Labour, enough
for a comfortable election victory.

Government tax revenues for the 1986/87
 year ended March 31 were more than 600 billion yen higher than
forecast and could be used to help fund the economic package
announced last week, Finance Ministry sources said.
    The final figure for 1986/87 will not be available until
next month, but some local newspapers speculated that the
carryover could be as much as 1,000 billion yen.
    The government is due to introduce a supplementary budget
during an extarordinary parliamentary session expected to start
in July. The budget will be used to finance the central
government share of last Friday's emergency economic package.
    That package totalled more than 6,000 billion yen,
including more than 1,000 billion in tax cuts.
    Government officials including Finance Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa have previously said possible revenue sources for tax
cuts include the tax revenue carryover from 1986/87 and
proceeds from the sale of shares in the privatized Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone Corp.
    The sale of 1.95 mln NTT shares in 1986/87 left about 450
billion yen available for use as a revenue source for tax cuts,
the sources said. Another 1.95 mln are expected to be sold in
the current fiscal year.

Fujitsu Ltd <ITSU.T> and International
Business Machines Corp <IBM.N> (IBM) had resolved some issues
in a longstanding dispute over software copyright protection,
Fujitsu said in a prospectus for a warrant bond recently issued
in London.
    The dispute involved questions of contractual
interpretation arising from a 1983 agreement between the
companies, the prospectus said.
    Under question was how much software information the firms
were obliged to disclose to each other. The case had been
before the American Arbitration Association (AAA) since 1985.
    "By subsequent agreements, the parties have resolved some of
the issues and have established procedures to resolve presently
outstanding disputes with the involvement of the members of the
panel of arbitrators," the prospectus said.
    "The Company is not in a position to predict with certainty
the outcome of this process and its effect on the future
results or operations, financial or otherwise, of the Group," it
said.
    A Fujitsu spokeswoman declined to comment on the
prospectus, noting the dispute remained under arbitration by
the AAA. An IBM spokesman here also declined comment.
    Last November the AAA ordered both companies to maintain
the confidentiality of the arbitration proceedings and said
that both Fujitsu and IBM had agreed that no additional comment
on the subject be made.
    Late last year, IBM and Hitachi Ltd <HIT.T> said they had
agreed to revise a separate 1983 agreement which arose out of
software disputes similar to those between Fujitsu and IBM.

Figures for first quarter 1987 West
German GNP will be published on June 11 after they were
provisionally scheduled for June 4, an official at the Federal
Statistics Office said.
    The official said there had been a delay in gathering
information for the data, which are expected to show that the
West German economy contracted in the period.
    A spokesman for the Economics Ministry in Bonn said there
was no political motivation behind publishing the figures on
June 11, the day after the Venice economic summit ends.
    "There is no political motivation. It is a purely technical
matter," he added.
    The West German government is expected to come under
pressure in Venice from both the U.S. And its European partners
to stimulate domestic demand as a way of reducing international
trade imbalances and contributing to world economic growth.
    However, government officials have ruled out any further
tax reduction packages to supplement a major program of
stimulatory fiscal measures already underway.
    Helmut Schlesinger, vice-president of the West German
central bank, the Bundesbank, said in Tokyo today that GNP, the
widest measure of a country's economic activity, fell in real
terms by a seasonally adjusted 1/2 to one pct in the first
quarter compared with the fourth 1986 period.
     The government has confirmed that growth was negative in
the first 1987 quarter. But year-on-year growth is expected to
be about two pct.
    Schlesinger today repeated the Bundesbank's reluctance to
cut its official interest rates further. Its key discount rate,
at three pct, is just above historical lows.
    West German officials are likely to emphasise at the Venice
summit that domestic demand, which draws in goods from abroad,
is already outstripping export performance, which has suffered
from an 80 pct rise of the mark against the dollar in just over
two years.
    The government has pointed out that depressed exports are
the main reason for the current weakness in the economy, but
says that later in the year stronger domestic demand will
compensate for this setback.
    It expects GNP growth for the whole of 1987 of just under
two pct, after a 2.4 pct rise in 1986.

For currency dealers Karl Otto Poehl is
the scourge of speculators, for bankers he is the man who has
played a key role in shaping the world's financial destiny for
the last seven years, and for Germans he is the guardian of the
mark.
    President of the powerful and independent West German
central bank, the Bundesbank, Poehl is likely to have his
contract renewed for another eight years when it expires at the
end of this year, government officials say.
    (Index of economic spotlights, see page ECRA)
    But no official announcement has yet been made, raising
eyebrows in West Germany's business community.
    The ebullient Poehl spent seven years in Bonn in top
ministerial posts under the Social Democrats, now in
opposition, before he moved to the Bundesbank.
    There has been speculation that Chancellor Helmut Kohl
would try to replace Poehl with a man closer to his own
Christian Democrats. But officials noted that Poehl has worked
closely and successfully with Finance Minister Gerhard
Stoltenberg since Kohl's government took office in 1982.
    Poehl, the most senior central banker apart from Paul
Volcker of the United States, enjoys a strong international
reputation which it would take a newcomer years to build up.
    Given these circumstances, Kohl will probably overlook
Poehl's past as an adviser to former Social Democrat Chancellor
Willy Brandt, and top aide to Helmut Schmidt when he was
Finance Minister, bankers said. It was Schmidt who, as
Chancellor, appointed Poehl to his present job in 1980.
    In recent months, with the mark's strong rise against the
dollar, Poehl has made exchange rates the central concern of
the Bundesbank's council, a highly conservative institution
which has doggedly pursued monetary policies to prevent
inflation catching hold. Older Germans can remember two bouts
of galloping inflation this century.
    But with consumer prices falling for much of 1986, and
inflation negligible so far this year, Poehl thinks it is safe
to relax the monetary reins a little and concentrate on the
dangers to the German economy of a bloated exchange rate.
    "I am of the opinion that efforts to stabilise the
dollar/mark rate have reached a high priority, also for the
Bundesbank, because a further massive revaluation of the mark
would endanger the economy in West Germany," he told business
journalists in Frankfurt recently.
    Ute Geipel, head of research at Citibank AG, says that
Poehl's reappointment would guarantee flexible monetary policy.
    "Poehl's policy has always been a policy which does not
focus so rigidly on domestic factors, but also on the external
economy," she said.
    An economist at a German bank, who declined to be
identified, said "If Poehl is confirmed in his post, it will
certainly be a plus for the pragmatic course which is not so
rigidly oriented towards money supply."
    One of Poehl's great struggles recently has been to
persuade the United States to stop "talking down" the dollar. For
Poehl, the significance of the February Louvre Accord was that
the United States agreed to join efforts to stabilise
currencies.
    The Louvre Accord was greeted with scepticism by currency
dealers who said they would soon put it to the test. But in
fact the dollar has been relatively stable since the pact.
    "This is because the markets know - or perhaps because they
don't know - what the central banks can do," Poehl says of
intervention in currency markets which can quickly turn rates
round, making a speculator's position worthless.
    Poehl was born in 1929 and worked as a financial journalist
in the 1960s before starting his ministerial career.
    A relaxed sun-tanned figure who enjoys cracking jokes over
a glass of beer, he is hardly a stereotype central banker.
    He is also a keen sportsman who likes to watch football and
play golf.
    Poehl says currency market intervention cannot substitute
for correct economic policies if exchange rates are imbalanced.
    "But you can achieve an enormous effect with a small amount
if you strike at the right moment," he said. Bundesbank dealers
are very professional and skilled. "They've burnt the fingers of
many people," he said. And unlike the speculators, Poehl notes,
the Bundesbank dealers usually make a profit.

Britain's gold and currency reserves rose
a record underlying 4.76 billion dlrs in May, following April's
2.9 billion dlrs increase, the Treasury said.
    The underlying trend indicates the level of recent Bank of
England intervention on currency markets to curb sterling's
strength. It was above market expectations which had been for a
rise of between one billion and three billion dlrs.
    The Treasury declined comment on the figures.
    Actual reserves rose 4.87 billion dlrs in May, compared
with April's 2.8 billion increase, to a total value of 34.68
billion dlrs, compared with 29.81 billion at the end of April.
    Borrowings under the exchange cover scheme were 238 mln
dlrs, against April's 66 mln. Repayments under the scheme were
85 mln dlrs, after 90 mln previously, with capital repayments
of eight mln, after three mln last month.
    Repayments of government debt amounted to 33 mln dlrs.
    The underlying reserves increase is net of borrowings and
repayments.
    It was larger than the previous record 3.04 billion dlrs
rise seen in October 1977. The May increase represents the
seventh monthly rise, with reserves up 9.947 billion dlrs in

months after the launch. The rules were first proposed March
27.
    Christopher Sibson, secretary general of IPMA, said the
rules are not expected to have a noticeable impact on the

which have been scarce recently.
    This year, euroyen issuance has outstripped dollar bonds.
    Sibson said that the rules are intended to provide greater
liquidity in the new issues market where underwriters sometimes
step away from deals they have managed if the market moves away
from them.
    However, he noted that the IPMA rules are voluntary and the
organization has no authority to enforce them.

Glynwed International Plc <GLYN.L> said it
had bought all the issued shares of two companies belonging to
Gallaher Ltd, a subsidiary of American Brands Inc <AMB>, in a
deal worth around 14 mln stg.
    The full names of the companies purchased from Gallaher are
<Formatura Iniezione Polimeri Spa>, Genoa and <FIP U.K. Ltd>,
Weybridge.
    Consideration for the purchases, which will be based on the
net asset values per share of the companies, has yet to be
finalised but some nine mln stg of the total represents debt
assumed by Glynwed.
    FIP is a manufacturer of valves and other pressure pipe
fittings in thermoplastics. Its products are complementary to
those of Glynwed subsidiaries, Durapipe U.K. And Philmac.
    The acquisitions appreciably develop and strengthen
Glynwed's strategic position in the thermoplastic pipework
systems market.
    The sale by Gallaher reflects a decision to dispose of more
peripheral businesses. Proceeds of the sale will be used in the
continuing expansion of the Gallaher group. Glynwed shares were
up 5p to 494 after the announcement. Gallaher is not quoted on
the London Stock Exchange.

Peptide T, a minute chemical
structure that can be easily manufactured, effectively blocks
the attack of the deadly AIDS virus on human cells, researchers
claimed.
     The U.S. National Institute of Mental Health announced at
the third annual International Conference on Acquired Immune
Deficiency Syndrome that Peptide T, first identified by
institute neuro-scientist Dr. Candace Pert, "potently blocks
entry of the AIDS virus into cells..."
    
    The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has quickly approved
clinical testing of the naturally-occurring brain chemical. The
decision  makes possible tests on AIDS victims.
      Dr. Frederick Goodwin, the institute's scientific
director, said in a joint interview with Pert, that "my gut
reaction is that we are onto something."
      He said that based on initial findings Peptide T may hold
more promise as a treatment for those already suffering from
AIDS, but could also have some value in the search for a
vaccine to prevent the spread of the disease.
   
    A research team has found that Peptide T is capable of
fully reversing brain cell damage caused by AIDS under a
variety of laboratory tests.
    Pert said that she sent doses of Peptide T last autumn to a
Swedish doctor who provided the chemical to four AIDS patients.
One died, but the three survivors showed some improvement, she
said.
   
    Goodwin said that three major drug firms, which he declined
to identify, are anxious to win permission to produce the
Peptide T substance that he said has potential for finding a
vaccine to safeguard against the deadly disease that has
threatened the lives of over a million people thus far.
    Pert said that the clinical testing in the United States
would involve at least a dozen AIDS patients in a controlled
environment, probably starting next month, which would
hopefully verify the chemical's usefulness.

Rainier Bancorp said it will add an extra
58 mln dlrs to its loan loss reserve in the second quarter for
possible credit losses related to Third World loans, causing a
net loss of about 19 mln dlrs or 87 cts per share for the
quarter and a loss of two mln dlrs or nine cts a share for the

    It said second half earnings are expected to be at "normal
profitability levels," resulting in "significant" profits for
the year as a whole.
    The company said the addition will raise its loan loss
reserve to 136 mln dlrs.

The record 4.9 billion dlrs rise in U.K.
Reserves in May to a total 34.7 billion has lifted hopes for a
further cut in bank base lending rates after the June 11
general election, market analysts said.
    Sterling would have risen on the much better than expected
number but for market nerves about the poll outcome, they said.
    But the weight of foreign currency and gold reserves now
available to the authorities to support the pound should curb
any market tendency to panic if U.K. Opinion polls show the
ruling Conservative Party's lead slipping, they added.
    "We have been intervening to a very much greater extent than
we have done hitherto," Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson
said at a news conference today, commenting on the news of the
record reserves rise.
    He put the U.K. Intervention in the context of the Louvre
accord between leading industrial nations to stabilise the
dollar, partly through direct intervention on foreign
exchanges. "We have been playing a very full part ourselves," he
said.
    But market analysts see the recent upward pressure on
sterling, and consequent need for official sales to damp down
its rise, more in the light of local factors.
    Steven Bell, chief economist at Morgan Grenfell Securities,
said that corporate money has been flowing back into Britain
amid hopes of another Conservative government, after fears last
autumn of a Labour election victory sent it flooding out.
    U.K. Portfolio investment is also returning, while foreign
buyers see U.K. Growth propects and high bond yields as
attractive. They will be strong buyers of U.K. Assets, notably
equities, once the election is out of the way, Bell said.
    Analysts see this pressure as the main hope for lower
interest rates, as the government is expected to try to reverse
the loss of export competitiveness caused by a strong pound.
    Today, however, the pound hardly moved on the reserves
news, dipping on its trade-weighted index against a basket of
currencies from 73.1 pct of its 1975 value at 1000 GMT to 73.0
pct at 1100 GMT, half an hour after the figures were released.
    "The market doesn't want to do anything because of the
election," commented an economist at a big U.S. Investment bank.
    Several dealers and analysts added that market forecasts of
a rise in reserves of between one and three billion dlrs had
overestimated the amount of pound sales that were likely to
have been disguised by swap arrangements or transactions on the
forward market.
    The market also seemed to have overestimated the amount of
sterling the Bank of England bought at the end of May to smooth
the pound's sudden downturn, while some of the intervention
reported in May probably occurred in April, they said.
    The key three months interbank money market rates eased
about 1/8 point, reflecting cautious hopes that the downtrend
in U.K. Interest rates will be revived following the reserves
news, analysts said.
    Government bond prices initially firmed, but the market was
muted as traders worried about the funding implications of
another huge rise in reserves, they added.
    Morgan Grenfell's Bell forecast a half point base rate cut
from the current nine pct level soon after the election, so
long as poll projections of another Conservative victory prove
accurate, with another half point later.
    Justin Silverton, equity economist at Credit Suisse
Buckmaster and Moore, said a full point reduction might be
possible. "Sterling will be held down by interest rate cuts in
future, rather than this active intervention," he predicted.
    Kevin Boakes of Greenwell Montagu Gilt-Edged cautioned
against over-optimistic forecasts, but agreed a half point cut
looked likely.
    A cut before the election has been virtually ruled out.
    "The Bank (of England) is both worried about the political
problem of cutting rates during an election campaign ... And
has signalled some worry about broad money (growth)," said Robin
Marshall, chief U.K. Economist at Chase Manhattan Securities.
    He said the 10 billion dlrs increase in total reserves in
the past seven months may foreshadow full U.K. Entry into the
European Monetary System.
    But Bell said the authorities would like to see another 10
or 15 billion dlrs in the reserves before joining, if they did
so. But, unlike many analysts, he doubted the U.K. Will go in.

The World Bank, in the throes of a
painful reorganization, faces new strains because of actions by
Citibank and others to set aside new Latin debt reserves,
financial analysts and monetary sources said.
    The monetary sources said the reorganization has caused
some bad feelings and charges that promotions and other
personnel actions have been based on personality rather than
ability. It also had some effect in undermining the Bank's role
in the global debt strategy, the sources said.
    At the center of the controversy is Bank President Barber
Conable, whose reorganization efforts are getting some 
critical review from many Bank staff members and some member-
countries including the United States.
    "I think if he were to do it again, he would do it very
differently," said one source.
    Conable, a former congressman from New York appointed by
President Reagan to the senior most position at the Bank nearly
a year ago, has taken the view that the Bank badly needed to be
reorganized and perhaps made more streamlined.
    In this he had the backing of many in the Reagan
administration who viewed the Bank as a bloated and inefficient
bureaucracy that gave money to countries when other free-market
sources of assistance were available.
    However, the Bank had been singled out for a much greater
role under the U.S. debt initiative proposed by Treasury
Secretary James Baker.  That strategy, which called for some 20
billion dlrs in new funding from the commerical banks and nine
billion dlrs in spending from the development banks, mostly the
World Bank, came under profound doubt with the decision by
Citibank and Chase Manhattan to set aside new reserves.
    This move, heralded by some sources as a measure that gives
all parties more time, frightened others, who see it as the
beginning of a tit for tat exercise that could lead to complete
unraveling of the monetary system.
    As envisioned by the latter, the next move would be for
Brazil, which has delayed payments on its debts, to say it does
not intend to pay interest for a very long period of time.
    Citibank and other banks could then decide to stop
financing the country's export credits, the funds countries use
to support their daily activities, leading to an economic
breakdown.
    "Within six weeks alot of countries could be out of
business," said one source.
    Citibank's initial step last month was to set some three
billion dlrs in a general reserve for potential losses on loans
to developing countries.  It was followed by a similar move by
Chase Manhattan some days later.
    In the best of all worlds, the kind of cooperation that was
demonstrated between the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the
multilateral development banks, the wealthy countries and
commercial banks when the debt crisis surfaced in 1982, could
emerge again but no one is expecting that.
    If anything, the negotiations have become much more
confrontational with the debtor countries pressing for more
concessions, arguing that they face growing political
instability if they are asked to do or pay more.
    They are very critical of the IMF's austerity measures and
there is sympathy for their view among the development
community.
    "When you hear code words like structural adjustment and
tightening your belt.  What that means is that the poor peasent
making 700 dlrs a year should drop it to 500 dlrs," says one
source.
    He adds: "And when your hear they should have market forces
at play, that means the level of public services should drop."
    It had been hoped that giving the World Bank a greater role
in the debt strategy might defuse the growing resistance in the
debtor countries to measures that increased already prevalent
poverty even further.
   The Bank, which primarily assists countries in the building
of roads, sewerage systems, education, and other so-called
infrastructure, is viewed in the Third World as benefactor.
   The IMF, however, which essentially forged the debt stategy
following the disclosure by Mexico in 1982 that it was near
default, is considered a stern taskmaster that has little
sympathy or even understanding of poverty.
    But there are doubts about how well the Baker initiative
has worked and about the World Bank's success at bringing about
increased growth in the Third World under the U.S. prescription
which indicated that countries might grow their way out of
their difficulty.

President Reagan said Paul Volcker has
declined to serve another term as chairman of the Federal
Reserve Board, the U.S. central bank. Reagan
nominated economist Alan Greenspan in his place.
    Volcker's term expires in August.
    Reagan, in a brief announcement in the White House briefing
room, said he accepted Volcker's decision "with great reluctance
and regret."
    Volcker, first appointed to the Fed post by President Jimmy
Carter in 1979, said "there is a time to leave and a time to
come ... I have no feeling I was being pushed."
    Volcker, appearing with Reagan, Greenspan, and Treasury
Secretary James Baker in the briefing room, said he will remain
on the job until Greenspan's nomination is approved by the
Senate.
    In a tribute to a smiling Volcker standing beside him,
Greenspan told reporters that one of the departing chairman's
greatest achievements was reducing inflation.
    "It will be up to those of us who follow him to be certain
that those very hard won gains will not be lost. Assuring that
will be one of my primary goals," Greenspan said.
    Financial markets reacted with dismay at the departure of
Volcker, who has been widely credited with holding the line on
inflation and seeking to maintain stability in currency values.
    Immediately following Reagan's announcement, the U.S.
dollar weakened sharply against all major currencies and both
the bond and stock markets declined.
    But Greenspan told reporters he thought the dollar, which
has fallen sharply over the past year, has reached its low
point.
   
    "There certainly is evidence in that direction," Greenspan
said when reporters asked if the dollar has bottomed out.
    The market reaction was probably exaggerated by surprise
because the announcement followed a number of published reports
that the White House had decided to reappoint Volcker.
    Volcker's tenure at the Fed began under the cloud of major
inflation under Carter with consumer prices rising more than 10
per cent annually and the prime interest rate exceeding 20 per
cent.
   
    With Reagan's backing, Volcker pursued a tight money policy
that cut inflation to about three per cent annually and reduced
interest rates to their lowest level in nearly a decade.
    The tight money policies were also blamed for producing
a deep recession in 1981 and 1982 that caused major political
problems for Reagan.
    Reagan reappointed Volcker to the chairmanship in 1983.
   
    Greenspan, who heads his own Wall Street consulting firm,
was chairman of President Ford's Council of Economic Advisers
from September 1974 until January 1977.
    Greenspan, a Republican, is considered a traditional
conservative economist and has been an adviser to several
presidents.

A representative of the poultry
industry said statistics showed that chicken is less frequently
the cause of salmonella poisoning than beef, dairy products or
salads and other mixed foods.
    Kenneth May, President of Holly Farms Poultry Industries
and a director of the National Broiler Council, told a House
Agriculture subcommittee the incidence of salmonella in chicken
has not increased in recent years and that chicken is neither
the major source of the bacterial poisoning nor the cause of an
increase in outbreaks of the disease.
    May said the Center for Disease Control figures showed that
between 1978 and 1982, chicken was involved in four pct of all
U.S. salmonellosis outbreaks, while beef accounted for ten pct
of outbreaks and dairy products six pct.
    May said the remaining outbreaks were caused by salads and
mixed food, turkey, seafood, pork, eggs and other foods.
    May said the chicken industry favored moving away from
bird-by-bird inspection procedures to a risk assessment system
better able to identify microbial and bacterial contamination
of poultry.
    However, Ellen Haas, executive director of Public Voice for
Food and Health Policy, said bird-by-bird inspection should be
retained and labels should be attached to each ready-to-cook
chicken to remind consumers about preparation procedures
necessary to avoid illness.

inspection methods that she said can worsen poultry hazards.

Following is the full text of Federal
Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker's letter to President
Reagan declining reappointment to the Fed:
    Dear Mr. President,
    As the end of my term as chairman of the Federal Reserve
Board approaches, you naturally have to consider an appropriate
new appointment.
   
    In that connection, you will recall that, upon my
reappointment as chairman in 1983, I felt unable to make a firm
commitment to you or to the Congress to remain in office for a
second full four-year term. Despite my reservations at the
time, that term is in fact now almost finished. However, I do
think, after eight years as chairman, a natural time has now
come for me to return to private life as soon as reasonably
convenient and consistent with an orderly transition.
Consequently, I do not desire reappointment as chairman and I
plan to resign as governor when a new chairman is prepared to
assume office.
   
    I will be leaving with a sense of great appreciation for
your unfailing courtesy to me personally. More broadly, your
consistent support of the work of the Federal Reserve during a
particularly challenging period for it, for the financial
system, and for the economy has been critical to whatever
success we have had.
   
    Without doubt, strong challenges remain for all of those
involved in economic policy. In that effort, I believe the
nation will continue to be well served by a strong Federal
Reserve System -- a system firmly dedicated to fostering
economic and financial strength and stability and able to bring
to that effort a combination of sound and independent
professional judgement and continuity beyond any partisan
considerations.
   
    May I add, too, my personal best wishes for the remainder
of your own term in office during which you have done so much
to restore a sense of confidence and self-reliance among the
American people.
    Faithfully yours,
    Paul A Volcker

the Bank of England has carried out recently is clear proof of
Britain's determination to stabilise exchange rates as agreed
between the Group of Seven industrialised countries in Paris in
February, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said.
    Saying he was "content" with sterling's current value, Lawson
told reporters he wanted "to maintain the exchange rate
stability we have all signed up for." He declined to say if he
favoured a rise or a fall from present sterling levels.
 May currency reserves, out today, showed a record 4.8 billion
stg rise, pointing to massive currency intervention.
    In April, reserves rose a hefty 2.9 billion stg.
    Pointing to the reserves data, Lawson said, "We have been
playing a very full part ourselves" in meeting our commitments
toward exchange rate stability as agreed in Paris.
    "We wish to see it (stability) continuing," he added.
    Asked which techniques were available to preserve
stability, Lawson said both central bank intervention and
interest rate changes could be used to tackle "the market
pressures there are from time to time."
    "Interest rate stability is not an objective in that
sense...Rates have to be moved up and down at times," he added.
    Lawson said he expected intervention to be "sterilised" by
draining excess sterling liquidity from the market through new
issues of government securities and foreign currency sales,
when the market allowed.
    This would limit the inflationary impact of intervention,
he said.
    "Sterilisation will be dictated by market tactics...Not
necessarily in the month in which intervention occurs," Lawson
said. "I am confident that we can sterilise on this scale."

U.S. District Court Judge Eugene
A. Gordon said he will decide "in the next few days" whether to
grant Burlington Industries Inc's request to stop a takeover by
Samjens Acquisition Corp.
    "I do not know how I come down on this preliminary
injunction," Gordon said after listening to arguments by
attorneys for 1-1/2 days.
    "It's been a long time since I was deluged with as much
information as I have been. I have to consider what's been
presented and issue an opinion on this. Both sides cannot be
winners," he said.
    Burlington requested the injunction to stop a takeover
effort by Samjens, claiming the partnership used illegally
obtained confidential information about the company to make its
offer. It also alleges there would be anti-trust violations if
Samjens, formed by Asher Edelman and Dominion Textiles Inc of
Canada, were to succeed.
    Samjens last week topped a 76 dlr per share offer for
Burlington from Morgan Stanley Group <MS> by one dlr per share.
Morgan Stanley made its 2.44 billion dlr bid after Samjens bid
72 dlrs per share for Burlington.
    Burlington lawyers told the court if the injunction is not
granted Samjens would win control of Burlington. A Samjens
lawyer argued that if the judge granted the injunction it would
"kill the offer"
    Jay Greenfield, an attorney for Samjens, said the
partnership would suffer irreparable harm if the injunction
were granted. "There's only one Burlington," he said. "If we
cannot get that then no amount of money can compensate us."
    Greenfield also said Samjens could sell its holdings in
Burlington for 95 mln dlrs. "We don't want that. We're not in
this for the money," he said.
    Irving Nathan, a Burlington lawyer, reiterated that
information provided by James Ammeen, a former Burlington
executive, was crucial to Dominion's decision to attempt o
takeover of Burlington.
    "Dominion relied on the information provided by the insider
Jim Ammeen," Nathan said.
    An attorney for Ammeen, who is named as a defendant, asked
the court to dismiss the lawsuit against his client. The judge
said he would not rule on the request today.

The West German government's independent
council of economic experts believes a further stimulation of
the economy is inappropriate, government spokesman Friedhelm
Ost said.
    A statement released by Ost after a meeting of Chancellor
Helmut Kohl and senior government officials with the council
said the experts believed 1987 ecomomic growth of 1-1/2 to two
pct was achievable.
    It added the council believed "an intensification of the
already expansionary stimulation of monetary and financial
policy is not called for."
    Ost's statement said experts believed further pressure on
West Germany to adapt to external economic factors would not
increase.
    The government regularly uses the term "changed external
economic factors" when referring to the fall of the dollar,
which has severely damaged West German exports. Bonn officials
have said they expect exports to pick up during the year, but
could still fall below the 1986 level.
    Along with other leading industrial countries, West Germany
agreed to a package of measures at a meeting in Paris in
February aimed at stemming the fall of the dollar.
    The stance taken by the experts backs up the official
position of the West German government ahead of next week's
seven nation summit in Venice, where Bonn is expected to be
pressed by the U.S. And other partners to boost its economy.
    West German government officials have stressed Bonn is not
in a position to stimulate growth further since tax cuts due
next year and 1990 are already stretching the budget.
    The Bundesbank has also ruled out a quick cut in official
interest rates although it sees market rates continuing low.
    The experts' prediction for economic growth this year of
between 1-1/2 and two pct is a slight downward revision from a
forecast made last November when two pct growth was forecast.
    Many independent forecasters have revised down 1987
predictions in light of the downturn in exports. The government
itself has said it expects growth of just under two pct,
compared with a 2.4 pct expansion in 1986.

    Carol Tucker Foreman, President of Foreman and Heidepriem

consumer services, told a House Agriculture subcommittee, "every
hour of every day, 22 Americans become victims of chicken
contaminated with salmonella."
    She said every two and a half weeks, an American dies of
salmonellosis or complications arising from it and the
incidence of poisoning from poultry has increased steadily over

    Foreman said USDA should follow a National Academy of
Sciences recommendation to label chicken packages to remind

    She urged USDA to require that birds be washed thoroughly
before they are defeathered and that defeathering machines be
cleaned several times a day, that birds be condemned if their
intestines are punctured or there is visible fecal
contamination and that chiller water be changed more often.

U.S. House Speaker Jim Wright said he
was concerned that the appointment of Alan Greenspan to succeed
Paul Volcker at the Federal Reserve Board would mean interest
rates would rise.
    Speaking to reporters, the Texas Democrat said that based
of Greenspan's tenure as chairman of President Nixon's Council
of Economic Advisers his policies would mean higher rates.
    "His previous service indicates the kind of economic
policies based on the trickle down theory rather than the
percolate up theory. This theory tends to higher interest
rates," Wright said.
    Wright told reporters he would not have chosen Greenspan to
head the Fed, but he declined to name his preference. "It would
be someone whose primary interest is in keeping interest rates
low. That is the national interest," he said.
    His main concern was that high interest rates have slowed
economic growth and held down the number of new jobs. The
United States needs "to reduce the level of interest rates so
this economy can get oxygen and breathe," Wright said.
    Wright said he had not talked with Greenspan about the
appointment.
    Asked to rate Volcker's tenure, he replied, "Long."

The stock of HF Ahmanson and Co fell
sharply after analyst Robert Hottensen of Goldman Sachs and Co
cut his earnings estimates of the savings and loan, traders
said.
    Ahmanson's stock fell 1-1/8 to 20-1/8 in active trading.
    Hottensen was unavailable for comment, but a spokeswoman
for Goldman Sachs said the reason for the reduction in earnings
estimates is the decline in demand for mortgage loans as
interest rates move higher. Mortgage rates moved to double
digits in april for the first time since last summer.
    The Goldman spokeswoman said that sales of adjustable rate
mortgages was a significant factor in Hottensen's original
earnings estimates.
    Last year, when the company's net income was 3.22 dlrs a
share, Ahmanson generated more than half of its 541 mln dlrs of
pretax income from gains on loan sales, the spokeswoman said.
    She said the reduction in earnings estimates to 2.60 dlrs a
share in 1987 from a previous estimate of 3.30 dlrs, reflects
less optimism with the mortgage loan environment.
    In the present environment for mortgages, the spokeswoman
said, Ahmanson's second quarter earnings should drop to 45 cts
a share from last year's 80 cts a share.
    Hottnesen expects the savings and loan to earn between 2.90
dlrs and 3.10 dlrs a share in 1988. he had previously estimated
earnings of 3.30 dlrs a share in 1988.

Spectra-Physics Inc said it is
considering the possibility of recapitalizing, restructuring,
or seeking a buyer for the company following its rejection of
an unsolicitied 32 dlr a share bid from Ciba-Geigy Corp.
    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
the San Jose, Calif., gas lasers and accessories company also
said its board Sunday agreed to a plan that gives 52 top
executives bonuses ranging from 20 to 50 pct of their base
salary if they stay with the company through August 29.
    In rejecting the takeover proposal by the U.S. subsidiary
of Swiss-based Ciba-Geigy AG, the company said it was unfair.
    The Spectra-Physics board voted unanimously, with two
Ciba-Geigy representatives not participating, to reject the
Swiss-based chemical and pharmaceutical company's takeover bid,
citing an opinion from its financial advsior, Morgan Stanley
and Co Inc, that it is "inadequate and unfair from a financial
point of view to the holders of shares," the company said.
    The board also authorized a special committee and Morgan
Stanley to "vigorously investigate, pursue and authorize any
alternatives which would maximize the value of shareholders'
investment in the company," the company said.
    Among the alternatives the special committee will consider
are a sale of the company to a third party for more than 32
dlrs a share, a recapitalization or restructuring, including
self tender offers and/or asset dispositions through the use of
dividends, Spectra-Physics said.
    The "retention plan" for the 52 top officers will pay an
average bonus percentage of 28 pct of salary, it said.
    Spectra-Physics said its board approved the plan "in order
to encourage key operating personnel to remain with the company
during the period of turmoil and uncertainty engendered by the
(Ciba-Geigy) offer."
    Under the plan, the executives would be entitled to their
cash bonuses if they stay with the company through August 29,
but could receive them earlier if they are fired for reasons
other than gross and willful misconduct, or if they leave the
company because their salaries have been sharply cut.
    Spectra-Physics also said it filed suit against Ciba-Geigy
yesterday in U.S. District Court in Wilmington, Del., charging
it with making a takeover bid that was false and misleading in
violation of securities law and with violating the intent of
July 9, 1985 standstill agreement.
    Spectra-Physics said Ciba-Geigy indicated at the time of
the standstill agreement that it would not make an unsolicited
takeover proposal for the company and that the intent of the
agreement was that Ciba-Geigy would not acquire more than 20
pct of the company unless there was another takeover threat.
    Ciba-Geigy was 18.8 pct of Spectra-Physics and Reliance
Group Holdings <REL>, which is controlled by New York investor
Saul Steinberg, controls 12.8 pct.
    Spectra-Physics said the agreement prevents Ciba-Geigy from
raising its stake beyond 20 pct through Jan 1, 1992, unless
another person get more than 10 pct of its voting power.

Paul Volcker's decision not to go for a
third term as Federal Reserve Chairman and the nomination of

    Although Greenspan is known as a committed anti-inflation
fighter in the Volcker mould, doubts are already surfacing in
the U.S. financial markets as to whether he has enough
political clout and monetary experience to wage a tough
campaign against inflation over the next year or two.

inflation," said Stephen Axilrod, Vice Chairman of Nikko

U.S. analysts expect the American
Petroleum Institute's weekly report on oil inventories to show
a slight build in U.S. stocks of gasoline for the week ended
May 29, oil traders and analysts said.
    While the consensus is for an increase, a few would not
rule out the possibility of an decline. Traders said that
barring any surprises in tonight's report, they expect the
report to be neutral to bearish for oil prices.
    Heating oil stocks are also likely to build and runs to be
steady to slightly higher, which could add pressure on oil
prices, the analysts said.
    Crude oil was seen likely to build assuming imports
continue at relatively high levels.
    Analysts expect gasoline stocks to rise 500,000 to two mln
barrels above the 234 mln reported for May 22.
    Peter Beutel, oil analyst with Elders Futures inc, who
looks for a build said, "We have had five weeks of gasoline
demand at 7.3 mln bpd or more and it is likely to taper off to
between 6.7-7.0 mln bpd, which should make stocks build. Demand
would have to stay above 7.0 mln bpd to have a draw," he added.
    Rising demand is why oil traders and analysts expect a draw
in stocks of about of about one mln barrels.
   
    The U.S. Energy Information Administration in its latest
report for the four weeks ending may 22 said that gasoline
demand was up 4.4 pct to 7.3 mln bpd from the previous year.
    But analysts said hopes of reduced stocks is likely to
founder on increased runs in refineries, which could be up 0.3
pct above May 22's 81.2 pct capacity operated.
    Such an increase would raise runs about 100,000 bpd and add
to U.S. stocks.
    But some analysts said that refiners may have held refinery
runs.
    Heating oil stocks were also expected to build between
700,000 barrels and one mln from the 96 mln barrel level
reported last week, but a rise in distillate stocks was
discounted as having a market impact at this time.
    "A build is seasonal now and not out of line with last year,"
one futures analyst said.
    Analysts said they also expect crude oil stocks to build
between 1.5 mln barrels and three mln from the 325 mln barrels
reported by API for the week of may 22.
    The consensus appears for about two mln barrels to be added
to the nation's inventory.

Nearby months in soybean and soymeal
futures could post a short-term rally on tightening supply of
livestock feed, even if favorable growing conditions keep the
new crop outlook bearish, traders said.
    "A lot of soymeal dealers are just getting very worried
about where processors will get their soybeans this Summer,"
one Illinois soyproduct dealer said.
    Processors are competing vigorously with river dealers for
the few soybeans being offered by country elevators, with a
Decatur, Illinois processor raising its spot soybean basis bid
another two cents today to 10 over July futures.
    Farmer marketings of old crop soybeans continue very light,
with flat prices apparently well below levels they are willing
to sell, dealers said.
    Some terminal elevator operators are coming to the belief
that even if futures rally back to last month's highs, country
movement may remain light because farmers in many areas are
sold out of old crop soybeans, particularly in the eastern half
of the Midwest.
    Soybean processors will continue to take seasonal downtime
for maintenance if soybeans remain difficult to buy, reducing
the weekly soybean crush rate still further and keeping the
spot soymeal basis strong, dealers said.
    Futures traders said tight cash supplies should help July
soybeans and soymeal gain on deferreds. July soymeal has
already moved to a premium over the August through October
months and old crop July/new crop November soybeans may also
move to a July premium later this month, they added.

domestically and internationally, Mr Greenspan will have to
demonstrate both his competence and policy independence before
he can gain full confidence of the financial markets."
    Greenspan is most knowledgeable on the behavior of the U.S.

The operator of a major U.S. crude oil
pipeline, shutdown because of flood damage, said it may be
several days before repairs are made and the system is
functioning again.
    Dan Stevens, manager of public and government affairs at
Texaco Inc <TX>, operator of the pipeline through its
subsidiary Texaco Pipeline Co, said the company hopes repairs
will begin in about five days and expects it to take several
more days to complete.
    "At this point we are lining up what we know we need, to get
the job done," Stevens said, adding that the timing for repairs
will depend on the damage to the pipeline which is difficult to
assess because of flooding on the Red River.
    The pipeline was shipping roughly 225,000 barrels of crude
oil per day, or about 55 pct of its capacity during the 30 days
preceding its shutdown on Saturday, Stevens said.
    The pipeline was shut down from Cushing, Okla, to Witchita
Falls, Kan, on Saturday due to an undetermined leak at the Red
River crossing, near the Oklahoma/Texas border, because of
severe rains, a spokesman for Texaco said.
    Stevens said it was reasonable to suggest the pipeline
could operate at full capacity when it reopens in order to make
up for the shortfull but cautioned they will talk with
customers to determine their requirements.
    Oil analysts and traders said they were not sure if the 
shutdown will continue to raise U.S. oil prices.

Morton Hyman said if oil production by OPEC rises during the

accordingly.
    Hyman, delivering a speech at the annual shareholders
meeting, said international tanker markets were generally weak
throughout the first quarter, but since the end of March OPEC
oil production has picked up. The result has been a modest
improvement in tanker rates.
    Overseas said 73 pct of its fleet handles liquid cargo.
   
    He said tanker requirements decreased in September 1986 as
OPEC production quotas dropped and levels of oil stocks rose.
    For the first quarter 1987, the company reported net income
of 10.3 mln dlrs, or 40 cts per share, compared to 9.3 mln
dlrs, or 36 cts per share, for the comparable quarter a year

    "The improvement in the company's 1986 results, after four
years of declining earnings, reflects a sharp, albeit
temporary, rise in freight rates in the international tanker
markets last summer," Hyman said.
    He said the Alaskan oil trade continues to be the principal
source of employment for its U.S. flag tanker fleet, which
represents approximately 15 pct of the company's tonnage.

The buffer stock manager of the
International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) will tender for about
3,000 tonnes of cocoa beans Wednesday, June 3, the ICCO said in
a statement.
    It said all other conditions remain unchanged from the
previous announcement.
    These conditions are that offers from registered companies
should be in pounds sterling for cocoa beans for which standard
differentials have been set in the ICCO's buffer stock rules,
and can be for cocoa afloat through to December shipment and
spot to December arrival/delivery.
    The basis position will be afloat, May/July shipment or
June arrival/delivery. For later positions the appropriate
carrying costs will be taken into account.
    The deadline for the receipt of offers by the manager shall
be 1330 hrs london time (1230 gmt) in the case of offers
emanating from the secondhand market and 1400 hours in the case
of offers emanating from the origins.
    The competitiveness of offers will be assessed by taking
into account the standard differentials, the cost of taking
cocoa into store (currently 23.00 pounds sterling from "cif
landed" and 38.00 pounds sterling from "cif shipping weights"
to "in store") and the cost of carry which currently is 12.00
pounds sterling per month, the ICCO said.
    No more than four offers will be considered from each
offering party, it added.

U.S. military forces in the Mideast
Gulf are under orders to protect only American flag vessels and
occasional U.S. arms deliveries on other ships to
"non-belligerent" states in the area, the Pentagon said today.
    "No one has ever stated or supported a policy of protecting
all shipping in those waters," Pentagon spokesman Bob Sims said
as the Reagan Administration drew up plans to increase the
protective U.S. military presence in the gulf.
    Sims denied published reports that U.S. Defense Secretary
Caspar Weinberger sought air cover to protect all neutral
shipping in the western gulf from attacks by Iran and Iraq.
    "As we have said repeatedly, only American flag vessels are
under our protection with the exception, on a limited
case-by-case basis, of ships carrying our Foreign Military
Sales equipment to friendly, non-belligerent states in the
region," Sims said.
    U.S. warships in the gulf two weeks ago protected a Kuwaiti
ship which sailed to Bahrain with U.S. arms for Bahrain and
Kuwait. But Sims said Washington had received assurances that
the the arms would not be used elsewhere.
    He said Kuwait, which is turning 11 oil tankers over to
U.S. firms to fly the American flag and be protected by the
U.S. warships, is not considered a belligerent despite Iranian
charges that Kuwait is supporting Iraq in the gulf war.
    Kuwaiti tankers have come under repeated Iranian attack.
    Sims refused to say how the United States will beef up its
seven-ship Middle East Task Force in the gulf to protect the 11
Kuaiti tankers. But Pentagon officials said that additional
ships and air cover are under consideration.

Hollinger Inc will pay about 50 mln dlrs
cash for its previously reported acquisition of privately owned
Unimedia Inc, chairman Conrad Black told reporters after the
annual meeting, confirming a published report.
    Commenting on press reports about the 50 mln dlr price tag,
Black said, "That would not be wildly inaccurate," although he
declined to disclose the actual cost.
    Montreal-based Unimedia is Quebec's third largest newspaper
group, with three French language daily newspapers in Quebec
City, Ottawa and Chicoutimi, Quebec and four printing plants in
Ontario and Quebec.
    Black added that Hollinger would also continue seeking
acquisitions of daily newspapers with circulation under 25,000
readers. He said Hollinger was currently talking to about 10
such newspapers in the U.S. where the company currently owns 23
dailies.
    "There is really no end to the ones that are available," he
told reporters, although he added that most remaining
acquisition opportunities are in the U.S.
    He said that Hollinger's 58 pct-owned Daily Telegraph PLC,
of London, should become profitable in this year's fourth
quarter.
   
    For full-year 1987, the Daily Telegraph could break even or
better, said Black, citing major reductions in labor costs and
improved technology at the Telegraph, Britain's largest
circulation quality daily. The Telegraph lost 13.2 mln Canadian
dlrs last year.
    Daily Telegraph chief executive Andrew Knight told
reporters after the meeting that the Telegraph's daily
circulation had risen by 25,000 since September to about
1,150,000 on weekdays, despite added competition from the new
Independent daily newspaper.
   
    Knight said The Independent was not affecting the
Telegraph's growth, but was making inroads into the circulation
of other London quality dailies such as The Times and The
Guardian.
    Hollinger chairman Black predicted Hollinger would post
1987 net income of about 55 mln dlrs, or one dlr a share,
including extraordinary gains from previous sales of
discontinued operations. Hollinger lost 87 mln dlrs or 6.54
dlrs a share last year on fewer average shares and after an
extraordinary loss of 52 mln dlrs.
   
    Black told shareholders that first quarter operating
earnings on continuing operations amounted to 499,000 dlrs
against a year-ago loss of 165,000 dlrs.
    Revenues on continuing operations rose to 102.1 mln dlrs
from 1.5 mln dlrs last year, which did not include Daily
Telegraph revenues, he added. Consolidated first quarter
figures were not disclosed.

House Speaker Jim Wright predicted
passage of legislation requiring the Reagan administration to
provide Congress with a report on its Mideast Gulf policy, but
a last-minute revolt by an alliance of liberals and
conservatives left the bill's fate in doubt.
    The legislation was written in the wake of the May 17th
Iraqi missile attack on the U.S. frigate Stark in the Gulf,
which killed 37 Americans, and President Reagan's decision to
protect 11 Kuwaiti oil tankers by putting them under U.S. flags
-- effectively making them American ships.
    Since the administration made known its reflagging plans,
congressional leaders complained they had not been consulted,
and some charged the policy could lead the United States into
the 6 1/2-year-old war between Iran and Iraq.
    The House was to vote today on a bill -- supported by the
Democratic and Republican congressional leadership and the
administration -- which demanded a report within seven days on
plans to meet the security needs of U.S. forces in the gulf.
    The resolution was expected to pass without controversy
today in the House Foreign Affairs Committee before the full
House was to take up the bill. But in a surprise move, liberal
Democrats and conservative Republicans on the committee joined
in an unusual alliance to oppose the resolution.
    Liberal Democrats said a lack of any restrictions in the
bill implied consent to Reagan's policies.

Some producers in the 1987 acreage
reduction program may be eligible for deficiency payments on 92
pct of their enrolled acreage even though none of it is planted
with wheat or other program crops, the U.S. Agriculture
Department said.
    The department said the provision of the Farm Disaster
Assistance Act will be available to all eligible winter wheat
producers, producers of other types of wheat who were prevented
from planting their 1987 wheat crop because of a 1986 natural
disaster, and all producers who operate farms with program crop
acreage bases subject to flooding on 50 pct of such crop's
permitted acreage.
    A producer who did not enroll in the 1987 acreage reduction
program may become eligible by signing-up no later than July
15. Producers will be informed by the local offices when
applications are being accepted, it said.
    The department said producers of wheat other than winter
wheat may use the 0/92 option if they were preventedf from
planting their intended acreage with wheat for harvest in 1987
because of any natural disasters which occured in 1986 or if
the farm is located in a county approved by Farmers Home
Administration for emergency loans for such disasters that
occurred in 1986.

West Germany's biggest
bank said it would withhold support from Volkswagen AG <VOWG.F>
management at next month's annual meeting because of the VW
currency scandal.
    Deutsche Bank AG <DBKG.F> said it would abstain in votes
exonerating VW management and the supervisory board, which
represents shareholders and employees, unless an auditor's
report on the currency scandal is published before the July 2
annual meeting and either clearly absolves or blames the
management and board.
    Several shareholder groups have said they will vote against
management at what promises to be a stormy annual meeting. If a
majority of shareholders back these groups, the top management
of Europe's biggest carmaker could be dismissed.
    Deutsche said it expected the results of the auditor's
report on the currency fraud, which cost VW some 260 mln dlrs,
to be published before the annual meeting.
    But in a letter to Deutsche customers depositing their VW
shares at the bank, Deutsche wrote: "Without knowledge of these
results, we do not think we are in a position to make you a
suggestion for or against exoneration of the management board
and supervisory board."
    "Unless you give us instructions to the contrary, we will
abstain with your shares ... but we reserve the right to vote
for or against exoneration of the management board and
supervisory board, if this seems in your interest in line with
the results of the auditor's report," it added.
    A strong shareholder vote against the management would
empower the supervisory board to dismiss the management if it
chooses, though such a move would not be mandatory.
    A member of the supervisory board who does not receive
exoneration at an annual meeting may have to step down.
    An abstention or no-vote by banks on behalf of customers
against management would in itself be a vote of no confidence.
    German banks traditionally use their huge proxy votes at
annual meetings to support the management of the company, in
which they are often represented on the supervisory board.
    VW management board chairman Carl Hahn said in April that
1986 profits had been hit by the scandal, in which documents
relating to currency arbitrage were allegedly faked, but
profits for 1987 would not be affected.
    Following the scandal, finance director Rolf Selowsky
resigned, and former chief dealer Bobby Junger was arrested.
    Deutsche represents 8-10 pct of VW's share capital, the
sources said, and F. Wilhelm Christians, one of the bank's two
management board spokesmen (chief executives) is on the VW
supervisory board.
    Banking sources said Deutsche was furious with VW after the
bank led an international placement of VW shares from the
company's record rights issue last September.
    Less than two months later VW announced a sharp fall in
interim profits, bashing its share price and severely denting
confidence in the German share market generally.
    A spokesman for the Savings Bank Association said that
German savings banks would vote not to discharge Selowsky, and
depending on whether the auditor's report was published would
abstain on the vote for other management board members.
    The federal government and the state of Lower Saxony
together have 40 pct of VW shareholders' votes. It is still
unclear how they will vote. Associations representing small
shareholders will also ensure the annual meeting is heated.
    The Protective Association for Securities Ownership has
said it will vote against the entire management board, and the
Protective Society for Small Shareholders will also vote
against the supervisory board.
    A spokeswoman for Deutsche Treuhand-Gesellschaft AG, the
auditors commissioned by VW in March to investigate the
scandal, declined to comment when its report would be issued.

Sears, Roebuck and Co's stock was

    Sosnick said "sluggish sales cloud the economic picture and
concern about the outlook for credit income diminish Sears'
near-term investment prospects." He said the retail sales in
May were weak, which would mean sales have been below plan for
the past two months.
    Sosnick said indications are that Sears may not be as

sales momentum, we have less confidence in that estimate."

With more private investment, not more
protection, the U.S. textile industry could become competitive
with the most modern foreign producers, analysts from two
congressional agencies said today.
    The Office of Technology Assessment, a nonpartisan arm of
Congress told a House Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee hearing
there was still concern for the future of parts of the U.S.
textile and apparel industry, but there was more reason for
optimism than a few years ago.
    "While textile producers are making significant
investments, they could do more," OTA analyst Henry Kelly said.
    The Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the nonpartisan
budget analysis arm of Congress, said federal loans or loan
guarantees would be preferable options for Congress rather than
increased trade protection which could lead to foreign
retaliation.
    CBO analyst Edward Gramlich said past trade protections,
first imposed in the 1950's have had only a small benefit for
profits and investments of domestic firms.
    Trade Subcommittee chairman, Rep. Sam Gibbons, said the
agencies analyses seemed to agree with his opinion against
congressional approval of protectionist textile quota
legislation aimed mainly at Western Europe, Japan and other
Asian textile producing countries.
    President Reagan last year vetoed a textile protection bill
but it was reintroduced in this session of Congress and is
expected to be voted on in the House this year.
    However, approval this year is in doubt because passage of
a major trade bill without specific protections for textiles
showed a weakening of support for the legislation.
    Most U.S. producers have fallen behind other foreign
producers in the use of modern textile and apparel production
equipment and net imports are growing faster than the domestic
markets, Kelly said.
    He added that private investment in the textile and
clothing industry in 1983 of 0.5 pct was less than one-seventh
the average manufacturing investment of 3.9 pct.
    Despite existing import quotas and tariffs, imports of
textiles grew 26 pct in 1986 and imports of apparel grew 14 pct
while U.S. production rose only 1.9 pct.
    "The traditional industry seems destined to be replaced by
new technology, imports, or some combination of both. While the
industry may not be able to compete in all domestic markets
that it enjoyed twenty years ago, the results of our research
indicate that portions of the domestic market can be recovered,
and that exports can be expanded," Kelly said.

    The Amoco buyout of debt-burdened Dome has angered Canadian

    Stacy described Amoco Canada's previously reported share

The U.S. House of Representatives 
approved a bill that requires the Reagan administration to
provide Congress with a report on its Gulf policy but does not
place any restrictions on its actions.
    The bill passed 305-102 -- winning a necessary two-thirds
of those voting -- despite a last-minute revolt by an alliance
of liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans who sought to
defeat it as a signal that a growing number of legislators
oppose President Reagan's policies in the region.
    The legislation was passed in the wake of the May 17th
Iraqi missile attack on the U.S. frigate Stark in the Gulf,
which killed 37 Americans, and Reagan's decision to protect 11
Kuwaiti oil tankers by putting them under U.S. flags --
effectively making them American ships.
    The legislation -- supported by Congress' Democratic and
Republican leadership as well as by the administration --
required Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger to provide a
report to Congress, within seven days of enactment, on plans to
protect U.S. warships and flag ships in the Persian Gulf.
    It did not, however, place any restrictions on the
administration as it proceeds to reflag the Kuwaiti ships and
thus has no immediate effect on U.S. policy.
    The Senate was expected to approve the legislation this
week. The bill would then be sent to Reagan for signature.
    Supporters of the bill said passage of the bill was only a
first step toward a greater congressional involvement in
formulating policy.
    But Democratic critics said the bill did not ask the
administration to address tough policy questions in the report.

A New York investment partnership
seeking control of Allegis Corp <AEG> disclosed that it has
asked the Department of Transportation to review a 700 mln dlr
note agreement Allegis has with Boeing Co <BA>.
    Citing what it called serious competitive and public
interest concerns in the deal, Coniston Partners, which holds
about 13 pct of Allegis asked the department to assert its
jurisdiction in the matter and require the two companies to
seek its approval for the transaction.
    In a petition to the department, contained in a filing with
the Securities and Exchange Commission, Coniston also claims
Boeing, a major aircraft manufacturer, has obtained control
over Allegis, parent of United Airlines, by virtue of the May
12 deal between the two companies.
    Under the deal, Boeing bought from Allegis 700 mln dlrs of
convertible notes due May 31, 1992 simultaneously with a 2.1
billion dlr aircraft order United placed with Boeing.
    Coniston said the notes give Boeing control over Allegis
and warned that the relationship between the two companies
raises antitrust issues and should be scrutinized closely.
    "The world's largest manufacturer of aircraft should not be
permitted to acquire control over one of the nation's largest
airlines without an opportunity for public comment and fact
finding and scrutiny by the regulatory agency having
jurisdiction over the air transporation marketplace," Coniston

    Coniston, calling itself the Allegis Investors Group in the

The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission (CFTC) released guidelines on how commodity trading
advisors (CTA) should calculate "beginning net asset value"
(BNAV) for purposes of computing rates of return required by
commission disclosure rules.
    The commission said it was compelled to release the
guidelines because it has received disclosure documents which
indicate "serious differences" in the way certain CTAs are
defining BNAW -- "differences that may have compromised the
ability to compare rates of return among different advisors."
    CFTC said CTAs must only use funds under their control or
in conjunction with their carrying futures commission merchants
in calculating BNAV.
    Computation of BNAV must exclude any item that is not
money, securities or other tangible property and any funds that
are not under the control of the CTA, or CTA in conjunction
with its carrying futures commission merchant.
    CFTC said "notational" funds must be excluded because they
are merely verbal promises to furnish funds.
    Funds in a commodity trading account over which a CTA has
discretionary trading authority must be included, CFTC said.

The Securities and Exchange Commission
charged Windsor Holding Co, a Chicago-based lamp and ceiling

pre-tax income by a total of 3.6 mln dlrs.
    Simultaneously with the filing of the civil case in U.S.
District Court here, the company, formerly Windsor Industries
Inc, three former officers and a former director, agreed to
settle the charges without admitting or denying them.
    But under the settlement, the company and the other
defendants consented to court orders barring them from
committing further violations of securities law.
    There were no monetary penalties in the settlement and the
company, which was delisted from the National Association of
Securities Dealers Automated Quotation, NASDAQ, system in May
1985, was not required to restate its earnings.
    The SEC charged Jose Arrojo, a vice president of a Windsor
subsidiary, Ronald Kahn, former vice of the company, and David
Garvin, former president of a Windsor subsidiary, with taking
part in a scheme to inflate the value of Windsor's 1982
year-end inventory, resulting in a 2.0 mln dlr overstatement of
the company's pre-tax income for that year.
    The company's inventory was again falsified a year later,
resulting in a 1.6 mln dlr overstatement, the SEC charged.
    Another defendant, Arthur Usheroff, a former Windsor board
member, the company and Kahn also failed to disclose in an SEC
filing an arrangement under which Usheroff was compensated for
services rendered in a 1983 Windsor public stock offering, the
agency said.
    Arrojo, Kahn and the company were also charged with making
false statements in required SEC filings.

of reorganization approved last December.

Currency futures are likely to move
higher following the sharp rally today after President Reagan
announced that Paul Volcker would not accept a third term as
Federal Reserve Chairman and that Alan Greenspan was nominated
as his replacement, currency analysts said.
    Contrary to predictions before the Volcker resignation,
analysts are calling for higher currency futures prices between
now and the June 8 Venice economic summit.
    In particular, uncertainty about Greenspan's attitude to
the dollar could undermine sentiment toward the U.S. currency,
analysts said.
    Greenspan said today that the dollar appeared to be nearing
a bottom, but the market will bear in mind his remarks in
Chicago last week that the dollar's recent move upward was a
technical reaction and that it would trade significantly lower,
analysts said.
   
    "Disappointment of European central bankers over the
appointment will be used as an opportunity to sell the dollar
lower," said Manufacturers Hanover Futures vice president Carol
Mackoff.
    "The international community will not like this
appointment," as it suggests the possibility that the U.S.
budget deficit is too much of a burden on monetary policy and
that Volcker was unable to get the commitment he sought to
reduce the deficit, added Merrill Lynch Economics analyst David
Horner.
     Furthermore, "that Greenspan was not named two months ago
suggests that he was not the Administration's first choice --
and that the status of his appointment was as a bridesmaid,"
Horner said.
    A declining dollar scenario with higher currency futures
prior to and throughout the Venice meetings would be mitigated
only by concrete action as opposed to "jawboning" at the G-7
summit, he said.
    But G-7 finance ministers, judged by recent statements, may
be at an impasse, analysts said.
    Japan and West Germany today reiterated that neither
planned further interest rate cuts, despite pressure from the
U.S. to do so, Mackoff said.
    The U.S., on the other hand, has not cut its budget deficit
as Japan and West Germany have urged, she said.
    Should G-7 members force a U.S. commitment to cut its
budget deficit in the next two years, a further decline in the
dollar could be forestalled, Horner said.
    However, "the impact from Venice will be nothing if nothing
changes," Horner said.
    Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co. analyst Craig Sloane
said European currencies will likely move to the higher end of
their 1987 ranges after today's sharp advance.
    For the next two weeks, Sloan calls for September yen
futures to advance toward the 0.007200 area. He said September
marks could close in on 0.5700 as an upside target, while Swiss
francs could climb to a range between 0.6900 and 0.6950.

The Basin Pipeline in the Southwestern

through its Texaco Pipeline Co subsidiary.
    "We project the pipeline will make all June crude shipments
scheduled," said Dan Stevens, the spokesman.

carrying an equivalent 280,000 barrels of crude oil per day
compared with an average 225,000 bpd shipped during the 30 days

    Stevens said the increased shipments will make up for all
crude oil scheduled to arrive in Cushing, Oklahoma via the
pipeline by the end of June.
    The pipeline was shut May 30 because of an apparent rupture
caused by flooding of the Red River, near the Texas/Oklahoma
border. It was expected to resume service Saturday but rising
waters of the river, which had recently receded, delayed the
reopening, Stevens said. Approximately 1100 feet of new 24-inch

The proposed European Community (EC) levy
on oils and fats has been criticised by CAOBISCO, the
association of EC biscuit, chocolate and confectionery
manufacturers.
    In a letter to the President of the Council of Ministers,
M. Eyskens, the association said the tax would cost the EC
biscuit, cake, chocolate and confectionery industries almost
200 mln European currency units per year.
    The tax also was contrary to the spirit of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and could prompt U.S.
Retaliatory measures on EC exports, CAOBISCO said.
    In a parallel move the British Biscuit, Cake, Chocolate and
Confectionery Alliance has written to U.K. Chancellor of the
Exchequer Nigel Lawson urging him to oppose the levy.
    President Charles Gillett said the tax was extending the
Commission's powers by allowing it to set levels of consumer
taxation, an area previously reserved for national treasuries.

Roy Denman, the European Community
representative in Washington, warned the United States against
setting a rule that trading partners running a surplus should
be "beaten over the head" for not removing trade barriers.
    Denman, in an Op-Ed piece in today's Washington Post, said
trade disputes should be dealt with through negotiations,
either bilaterally or multilaterally, through the Geneva-based
United Nations agency, General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,
GATT.
    Denman's comments came as the Senate was to begin debate
this week on a major trade bill.
    "It is dangerous to establish a rule that trading partners
running a surplus with the United States should be beaten over
the head if trade barriers objected to by the United States are
not removed within a certain time-scale," said Denman in an
apparent reference to some of the measures in the congressional
trade bill.
    "If we turn to the path of unilateral action, retaliation
and counter-retaliation, the one-world (GATT) trading system
will very quickly unravel," he said.
    Denman said the 170 billion dlr U.S. trade deficit was not
purely the result of unfair trade practices by foreign nations.
    "The trade deficit results from a combination of
macroeconomic factors (the U.S. budget deficit), the exchange
rate and the competitiveness of (U.S.) domestic industry,"
Denman said.
    He also said that Washington employed what he termed unfair
trade prctices.
    He said the European Community had recently updated a list
of some 30 U.S. trade barriers that impede EC exports.
    "We did not circulate this list with any hostile or
aggressive intent. We did so to set the record straight," Denman
said.

Bonn is expected to rush through
legislation this month creating special credits to protect West
German farmers from a proposed European Community, EC, payments
freeze, government sources said.
    The new measures are apparently designed to shield West
German farmers from the consequences of the looming EC budget
crisis and give Bonn scope to keep up its opposition to the EC
executive commission's farm policy reform plans, political
sources said.
    EC finance and farm minsters held an unprecedented joint
session in Luxembourg today to try to solve the stalemate over
future farm financing.
    West Germany has proved the main obstacle to Commission
attempts to raise fresh funds for farm financing by taxing
imports of vegetable oil and fats, for fear of U.S.
retaliation.
    Bonn has also opposed the abolition of an agri-monetary
mechanism that acts as a subsidy for West German farm exports.
    The draft legislation, which the ruling centre-right
coalition will present to parliament tomorrow, would provide
temporary credits for farm subsidies usually paid by Brussels.
    The Commission, facing a five billion European Currency
Units (5.73 billion dlrs) budget deficit by the end of the
year, has threatened to start phasing out payment of some
subsidies and premiums from August, unless EC member states
take urgent measures to provide fresh funds.
    West German Agriculture Minister Ignaz Kiechle gave the new
legislation top priority after last month's failure to agree to
a farm price package for 1986/87.
    Political sources in Bonn said Kiechle decided to take the
sting out of proposed Commission measures to cut back subsidies
by creating a buffer for West German farmers.
    The opposition SPD has agreed to back the Kiechle bill and
allow its hasty passage through parliament by July 1, ahead of
the summer recess, SPD sources said.
    SPD farm policy spokesman Jan Oostergetelo said his party
would support the bill, even though it would further swell
massive government spending on agriculture. He said the bill
was an admission that the government believes the farm price
talks will fail and the EC faces bankruptcy.

Treasury Secretary James
Baker said any further decline in the dollar against other
currencies would be counterproductive.
    Baker was asked after a speech to the Pan American Economic
Leadership Conference about U.S. policy in light of President
Reagan's comment last week at the Venice summit that he could
see some further decline in the dollar within reason.
    "All of the G-7 nations believe that any further decline in
the dollar would be counterproductive," Baker told reporters.
    Following the Venice press conference by Reagan, the White
House clarified Reagan's comments on the dollar by saying that
the United States wants a stable dollar.
    The main incentive for the United States to favor a weaker
dollar has been the need to reduce the massive trade deficit,
but the deficit has narrowed for the past two months and
appears to be responding to the 40 pct drop in the dollar
against the yen and the mark during the past two years.

The West German Government will be asked
June 16 to provide nearly 850 million marks (470 million
dollars) to lay off or retrain 20,000 steel workers whose jobs
are threatened by the recent slump in the country's steel
industry.
    Government spokesman Friedhelm Ost said Chancellor Helmut
Kohl will review a joint proposal by steel employers and trade
unions at a meeting on the ailing industry tomorrow.
    Both steel employers and union leaders are expected to tell
Kohl tomorrow that the Government has failed to do enough to
protect German steel firms from subsidies and unfair
competition from other European Community members.
    Government sources said Bonn was prepared to take part in a
common effort to find a solution for the steelworkers. But
since the Government is struggling to finance tax cuts by
slashing state subsidies, it is not prepared to pick up the
whole bill for the layoffs, the sources said.
    A spokesman for IG Metall, the metalworkers' trade union,
said the proposal seeks redundancy payments to 10,000 workers
in Ruhr and Rhineland plants. Some 6,000 workers would be
redeployed in non-steel making sectors of steel companies,
while a further 4,000 would be eligible for job-retraining
schemes.
    The union estimates that the redundancy payments would
total 600 million marks (340 million dollars), while job
retraining schemes would cost a further 240 million marks (130
million dollars).
    Up to 30,000 West German steel jobs are at risk in the next
few years following steep losses incurred by the industry since
mid-1986.
    Extensive restructuring of the industry in recent years was
unable to compensate for the effects of the weak dollar which
depressed foreign demand for steel, industry sources said.

Hot, dry weather over the Midwest, with
more forecast, pushed grain futures prices to new highs today
on the Chicago Board of Trade.
    Soybean futures led the advance, closing up the
30-cent-per-bushel daily trading limit in contracts for
delivery after this year's fall harvest. All months set
life-of-contract highs and November closed at 6.23 dlrs a
bushel.
    "The market is anticipating that it will stay hotter than
normal for some time out," said David Bartholomew, assistant
vice president for Merrill Lynch. "We have probably gone as
high as we need to go at this time, but I don't know how to
measure the euphoria level."
    Soymeal futures, which led the grain rally last week,
posted contract highs and ended up the 10 dlr a ton daily limit
in new-crop contracts. December closed at 195.70 dlrs.
    Corn futures set contract highs in March through September,
with December closing up the 10 cent a bushel limit at 2.11-3/4
dlrs. Wheat posted more modest gains as dry weather improved
harvest conditions in the southern Midwest.
    The hot weather could stress developing corn and soybean
plants in the Midwest, although some periods of dryness benefit
young plants by encouraging the development of deep root
systems, Bartholomew said.
    European demand for U.S. soybeans and meal contributed to
active buying here and an estimated 2.0 mln bushels of soybean
orders went unfilled at the close, traders said.
    After trading ended, a U.S. Agriculture Department (USDA)
meteorologist said the U.S. corn and soybean crops have not
suffered any yield loss yet from hot, dry weather.
    Strong grain futures ignored weakness in the value of the
dollar, which can depress prices by making grains more
expensive for foreign buyers.
    But the surge in soybeans encouraged buying at New York's
COMEX, where silver futures recovered from early lows to settle
steady.
    Managed fund traders bought silver on the belief that the
weather-spurred jump in grain futures will revive fears of
inflation. But the weak dollar pressured COMEX gold futures,
which closed down following last Friday's news of improved U.S.
trade deficit figures and better U.S. producer prices.
    A USDA report released after trading said the number of
cattle being fed in seven major producing states was above
levels expected by traders. Traders said the report would
probably push live cattle futures lower tomorrow at the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
    USDA put cattle-on-feed in the seven major states at 7.52
mln head, 106 pct of a year ago and at the high end of trade
forecasts.
    A total of 1.954 mln head were placed on feed during May,
up 111 pct from a year ago, and May cattle marketings were off
93 pct at 1.524 mln head, USDA said.
    Cattle futures closed mixed in choppy trading today as hot
weather slowed consumer demand for red meat, traders said.

The glitter of gold has generated a
three-way competition among the world's largest futures
exchanges for a 100-ounce contract for the precious metal.
    When the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) re-introduces
gold futures trading here Tuesday (at 9 a.m. CDT), it will go
toe-to-toe in an uphill battle against the Commodity Exchange
Inc. of New York (Comex), which brokerage executives describe
as the world's precious metals futures capital for
institutional business.
    And by autumn, the oldest and biggest exchange, the Chicago
Board of Trade (CBT), expects to join the fray when the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) approves a pending
application for a 100-ounce gold contract to trade side-by-side
with the CBT's smaller, one kilogram (about 2.5 U.S. pounds)
gold futures.
    The CME introduced a 100-ounce gold futures contract in
1974, but lack of interest forced it to abandon the instrument
in July 1986.
    CME officials said investors and brokerage firms asked the
exchange to reintroduce the contract because of recent
volatility in precious metals. Other factors influencing the
decision may also have been clearing problems in May which
forced the Comex to shorten trading for three straight days in
an effort to clear up a huge backlog of unresolved trades,
especially in silver futures.
    Comex's problems may now create a window of opportunity for
other exchanges to successfully offer precious metals
contracts, industry sources say.
    But it is much too early to predict whether other exchanges
can inflict serious damage on the Comex' daily trading volume
of more than 40,000 contracts which represents commitments to
buy and sell gold of more than 2 billion dlrs.
    While average daily trading in the CBT's smaller gold
contract, aimed at retail customers rather than institutions,
was under 500 contracts per day throughout 1986, it has
surpassed 1,000 contracts daily for the past two months.
    "The climate could not be better for this venture by the
CME," said Merrill Lynch Commodity Marketing Vice President Neil
McGarrity.
    "Everybody is talking about metals now, and interesting
daily trading ranges provide opportunities for bulls and bears.
There's good trading volume in all world outlets," McGarrity
added.
    "The Merc's gold futures would be insurance for dealers,
merchants and customers that there would be a market open for
trading," if heavy gold or silver futures volume causes the
Comex to close early again, said Jack Lehman, senior vice
president and director of commodities for Shearson Lehman Bros.
Inc. and a Comex board member.
    Delivery points vary for each exchange's 100-ounce gold
futures. Comex contracts are deliverable through New York
warehouses while the CME contract specifies London delivery
through a CME account at Samuel Montagu and Co. Ltd., a member
of the London gold market. The CBT gold application specifies
delivery from New York and Chicago vaults.
    The Comex and the CBT have applied to the CFTC for an
earlier precious metals opening to match the CME's starting
time of 7:20 a.m. CDT. The exchanges said the earlier start
allows for trading before many important government reports are
released at 7:30 a.m. CDT.
    CME marketing sources said arbitrage possibilities exist
with side-by-side trading, noting local interests can be
generated by traders dealing in foreign currency and short-term
debt futures along with gold futures contracts to further hedge
their financial risks.
    "If the dollar rises, traders can sell currencies and buy
gold," said David Johnson, CME's manager of currency products.
    The Chicago Board of Trade sees an extra advantage to gold
trading. "Given our night trading session, we could add either
our pending 100-ounce gold or our existing 5,000-ounce silver
contract to attract overseas business," a CBT official said.
    Which market is identified as the precious metal capital
does not appear to be a major issue among professionals.
    "We've seen Chicago bring in a new constituency before, with
perhaps different needs," Mocatta Metals Chairman Dr. Henry
Jarecki said.
    "Merchants will go to the CME or anywhere to trade a liquid
contract. Our firm is no exception," Jarecki said.
    "At worst, even if the CME gold futures fail, the Comex will
be under pressure to improve the integrity of its clearing
processes," a CME official added.

The growing shift of low-skilled
manufacturing jobs from the United States to Mexican border
cities is not a threat to American employment because it will
help create new markets for products, according to a study
released today.
    Richard Bolin, director of the Flagstaff Institute of
Arizona, which studies international trade issues, said the
United States needs to encourage the expansion of manufacturing
in developing countries so that those nations can become
consumers of more U.S. goods.
    His study was commissioned by the border city of McAllen,
Texas, for presentation to the International Trade Commission
which is gathering information for a report to Congress on what
changes may be needed in the U.S. tariff codes to prevent the
loss of jobs and industry.
    McAllen and other Texas border cities have benefitted from
a trend among U.S. companies to build twin plants that employ
factory workers on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border.
    More than 700 manufacturers are taking advantage of lenient
tax codes that allow U.S. companies to bring raw goods into
Mexico for assembly by low-skilled workers into products that
are completed by U.S. workers at a nearby sister plant.
    Bolin said his research indicated that the shift in
low-paying jobs across the border reflected changing
demographics of the U.S. workforce.
    "In the post-baby boom era, fewer workers will be available
to fill these low-skill jobs -- and these workers will be
better educated than prior generations," Bolin told reporters in
McAllen.
    "The jobs in low-tech industries that are being exported to
other countries are, for the most part, jobs that we may not be
able to fill in the future."
    U.S. employment in less-skilled manufacturing jobs plunged
by more than 900,000 between 1977 and 1982, largely due to the
transfer of jobs outside U.S. borders, he said. American
employment in high-tech industries increased by 634,000 during
the same period, he said.
    But high-tech industries, those in which engineers make up
more than six percent of the workforce, pay higher wages and
generate more U.S. exports than low-tech businesses, he said.

The dollar should worth more than 170 yen
based on purchasing power parity, the Ministry of International
Trade and Industry (MITI) said in its annual white paper on
international trade.
    Using 1973 as a base year, the ministry said inflation
differentials pointed to a yen/dollar rate of 172 in fourth
quarter 1986. The dollar opened here today at 144.90 yen.
    MITI also said the so-called "J-curve" and the drop in oil
prices together accounted for 33.2 billion dlrs of the 36.6
billion dlr rise in Japan's trade surplus last year.
    On a customs cleared basis, the Japanese trade surplus rose
to a record 82.66 billion dlrs last year.
    The ministry said the fall in oil prices accounted for 16.5
billion dlrs and the "J-curve" 17.2 billion dlrs of the rise in
the 1986 surplus.
    Analyzing the expansion in Japan's trade imbalance in
recent years, MITI calculated that 37 pct of it could be
accounted for by exchange rates, 24 pct by differences in
economic growth rates between Japan and other countries, and 36
pct by so-called price elasticities of imports and exports.
    Analyzing the expansion in the U.S. Trade deficit from 1982
to 1985, the ministry said 24 pct was accounted for by exchange
rates, 34 pct by differences in the income elasticity of
imports and exports and 39 pct by differences in economic
growth rates. The figures do not tally to 100 pct because other
minor factors have been left out.
    "One index of trade structure, the income elasticity of
exports and imports, shows that the U.S. Is more likely to
experience increases in imports, while Japan is structurally
predisposed to growth in exports," MITI said.
    Structural adjustment is already underway in Japan, under
the impact of the strong yen, MITI said. Japanese companies are
stepping up their imports and expanding capacity overseas.
    Japanese consumer attitudes are also changing. The ministry
cited a survey showing that price was now the number one factor
in the purchase of imports from the U.S. And Western Europe,
replacing design and brand reputations.
    "The smooth adjustment of the economic structure calls for
measures to address the needs of affected firms," it said. "Whole
industries have felt the pinch and employment is expected to
suffer."
    "Sustained economic growth, led by domestic demand, will
also be an essential condition," the ministry said.
    It said four structural factors have contributed to the
growth of the U.S. Trade deficit in recent years -- a decline
in U.S. Industrial competitiveness, insufficient productive
capacity, an increase in foreign procurement by U.S. Companies
and short-sighted U.S. Management attitudes.
    "While (U.S.) exports have picked up somewhat with the
dollar's fall in value, no marked improvements have appeared in
the import picture," MITI said.

The Japanese economy has bottomed out
after an extended period of stagnation, Finance Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa told a press conference.
    But he said he was not too optimistic about the state of
the economy as the employment situation was still shaky in
certain regions of the country.
    Yesterday, the Finance Ministry said its quarterly

The Venice summit accord gives the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) increased responsibility in
smoothing vital economic cooperation between industrial
countries, a senior IMF official said.
    The official, who met reporters but asked not to be
identified, made clear that the use of a series of economic
measurements to monitor the seven leading industrial
democracies would be difficult but was a major step in
cooperation.
    The United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Britain,
Italy and Canada agreed at the summit to use a series of
economic indicators to forecast economic behaviour in an
attempt to increase cooperation on economic policy.
    The setting of a formal process of review, while seen as a
step forward in the cooperative effort, was also criticised
because it lacked teeth to force a country to change economic
behaviour that hurt other countries.
    But the official said influences and peer pressure could
have a major impact in reforming an erring country.
    Economists generally believe a cooperative economic
approach by the largest countries will have a salutory impact
on the global economy, including helping the poorest debtor
countries.
    The official said the IMF function would be to warn
countries when their economic behaviour was straying badly and
try to persuade them to modify it. "I hope it will be a yellow
light, not a red flag," he said.
    He also said he hoped negotiations would begin in the next
few weeks to increase the IMF's structural adjustment facility,
which helps 62 of the world's poorest countries.
    The facility, approved about 15 months ago, is currently
financed at about 3.8 billion dlrs, but this would be tripled
under the plan.
    He said reaching an accord on the agreement would be very
difficult, with countries pressing each other to do more and
finding reasons to reduce their own exposure. "They will be
tremendously difficult negotiations," he said.

Japan's gross national product (gnp) rose
a real 1.2 pct in the January/March quarter after a downwardly
revised 0.7 pct increase in the previous three months, the
Economic Planning Agency said.
    The October/December rise was originally put at 0.8 pct.
    For the fiscal year ended last March 31, gnp rose 2.6 pct,
after a 4.3 pct increase in 1985/86. Last year's performance
was the worst since 1974/75, when gnp contracted by 0.4 pct,
and was below the government's revised three pct forecast.
    Economists said the strong yen was largely to blame for the
slowdown in economic growth in 1986/87.
    Domestic demand increased 0.7 pct in the January/March
quarter and 4.3 pct in the fiscal year, compared with growth of
0.6 pct in October/December and 3.7 pct in 1985/86.
    The annualized growth rate in the January/March quarter
accelerated to 4.9 pct, from 2.9 pct in October/December.
    In nominal terms, gnp rose 0.7 pct in January/March, after
a 0.5 pct October/December rise, reflecting lower prices.
    Domestic demand contributed 0.7 percentage point to real
gnp growth in January/March, while foreign trade added 0.5
point. In October/December domestic demand contributed 0.6
point, while foreign trade added 0.2 point.
    Of the 0.5 point contribution of foreign trade to gnp last
quarter, rising exports accounted for 0.3 point and falling
imports contributed 0.2.
    Total export volume rose 2.0 pct quarter-on-quarter in
January/March, while imports fell 1.2 pct.
    Of the 0.7 point contribution of domestic demand to
January/March gnp growth, the private sector accounted for 1.1
point while the public sector knocked off 0.4.
    The private sector contribution included 0.4 point for
corporate capital outlays and 1.0 for consumer spending, while
destocking subtracted 0.3 point.
    In 1986/87, domestic demand contributed 4.1 percentage
points to growth while foreign trade knocked off 1.5 points.
    In 1985/86, the domestic demand contribution was 3.6 points
and foreign trade 0.7 point.

Government officials said the worst may be
over for the Japanese economy, after today's news of stronger
than expected growth in the January/March period.
    But private economists were not so sure and said the
economy was unlikely to achieve the government's 3.5 pct growth
forecast in the current fiscal year ending next March.
    As already reported, GNP rose 1.2 pct in the January/March
quarter, after a revised 0.7 pct increase in the previous three
months. For the fiscal year that ended last March 31, GNP
growth slowed to 2.6 pct from 4.3 pct in 1985/86.
    The government economists acknowledged that the improved
export performance in the January/March quarter was unlikely to
be repeated. The volume of exports during the period was up two
pct from the previous three months.
    The yen's rise in April to about 140 to the dollar from 150
probably resulted in a fall in exports in the April/June
quarter, they said.
    However, given the yen's recent stability, stepped-up
domestic demand should work as a driving force to push the
economy onto a path of sustainable growth, they said.
    Many private economists, though, doubt that the economy
will achieve the government's 3.5 pct growth forecast for the
1987/88 year.
    Growth in 1986/87 also fell short of the government's
forecast, which was revised downwards to three pct last
December from an original four pct.
    Domestic demand as a whole is not strong enough, except for
housing, said Johsen Takahashi, chief economist at Mitsubishi
Research Institute.
    Consumer spending is likely to remain weak as the growth in
nominal income stays low, he added.
     The rise in consumer spending in the January-March quarter
was simply a reflection of the contraction that occurred in the
preceding three months, Takahashi said.
    Private capital spending in the quarter looked strong but
this was primarily because utility companies brought forward
their 1987/88 capital investment plans into the final quarter
of 1986/87 in line with the government's economic stimulation
package announced last fall, he said.
    Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank chief economist Kosaku Furuta said he
was unable to say the economy has bottomed out, but added he
expects increasing signs of recovery in the coming months.
    Destocking is coming to an end and companies are starting
to rebuild inventories, Furuta said.
    Housing is expected to remain buoyant, backed up by lower
interest rates as well as government policies to stimulate the
sector, he said. The government's recently unveiled 6,000
billion yen economic package will also help the economy.
    But he said that the economy was unlikely to achieve the
government's 3.5 pct forecast for 1987/88, although growth
might come close to three pct.

The West German government today considered
demands for nearly 850 mln marks to lay off or retrain 20,000
steel workers.
    Government spokesman Friedhelm Ost said Chancellor Helmut
Kohl reviewed a joint proposal by steel employers and trade
unions at a special meeting with steel industry
representatives.
    Companies like Fried Krupp <KRPG.D> and Hoesch Werke AG
<HWKG.F>, which saw profits plunge last year, have taken the
unusual step of aligning with the metalworkers' trade union, IG
Metall, to press for government finance to slim staff levels
still further.
    Government officials said Bonn was prepared to take part in
a common effort to find a solution for the steelworkers. But
since the government was struggling to finance tax cuts by
reducing state subsidies, it could not pay for all the layoffs.
    A spokesman for IG Metall said the joint proposal foresaw
redundancy payments to 10,000 workers in Ruhr and Rhineland
plants. Some 6,000 workers would be redeployed in non-steel
making sectors of steel companies, while a further 4,000 would
be eligible for job-retraining schemes. Redundancies are
estimated at 600 mln marks, while job retraining would cost a
further 240 mln.

Japan has no plans to liberalise its farm
markets, but will try to narrow the gap between the price of
farm products at home and overseas, Agriculture Minister
Mutsuki Kato said.
    He told reporters the move is aimed at deflecting criticism
of Japanese protectionism on its agricultural goods.
    But Kato said he has no plans to start bilateral trade
talks with the United States over rice, Japan's staple food.
    Washington has called Tokyo's rice policy an extreme
example of protectionism and has demanded access for U.S.
Growers to the Japanese market. This is closed to imports
except in emergency.
    Kato said Japanese farmers should however "shed some blood,"
to relieve the dangerous state of international farm trade.
    His comments precede a meeting on July 1 and 2 of the Rice
Price Council at which the government advisory body will
discuss the 1987 crop producer rice price.
    Kato said he welcomed the outcome of last week's recent
summit of leaders of leading industrialised democracies in
Venice and of farm trade talks at the Organisation for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) in May.
    Ministers at both conferences agreed on the long-term need
to cut subsidies worldwide, Kato said.
    Kato said that Japan is not the only country to protect
producers. He said the United States spends some 25.8 billion
dlrs a year to support producer prices and on its export
enhancement program and the EC 21.7 billion, while Japan spends
only 2.9 billion. He said that although Japan provides the
world's highest level of subsidies per acre, its subsidy per
farm family was several times lower than in the United States.
    Expressing concern about growing protectionist moves in
U.S. Congress, he said Japan should make efforts to prevent
farm trade issues between the two countries from becoming a
factor increasing protectionism in the United States.
    Japan and the United States are holding panel discussions
at the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade over Japan's
import restrictions on 12 farm items.
    Bilateral talks on beef and citrus trade in the period from
next April are due to start this autumn.

U.S. housing starts fell 2.7 pct in

    In April, housing starts fell a revised 3.8 pct to
1,665,000 units. The department previously said they fell 2.9

 First City had "sufficient time" to find a solution to its

Japanese compound feed output rose 2.3 pct
to 25.80 mln tonnes in 1986/87 ended March 31 from 25.23 mln a
year earlier, the Agriculture Ministry said.
    The marginal rise reflected slight growth in demand for
poultry raising and a moderate increase in demand for beef
cattle raising, Ministry officials said.
    Compound feed sales totalled 26.01 mln tonnes in 1986/87
against 25.40 mln a year ago, while end-March stocks were
217,554 tonnes against 224,101.
    Corn use in feed output in 1986/87 rose to 11.71 mln tonnes
from 11.02 mln a year earlier due to low import prices.
    The officials said corn imports rose because the world
surplus and the yen's strength against the dollar reduced
Chicago prices. The corn compounding ratio rose to 45.2 pct in
1986/87 from 43.4 pct a year earlier.
    Sorghum use rose marginally to 4.80 mln tonnes in 1986/87
from 4.79 mln, but the compounding ratio fell to 18.5 pct from
18.9 pct because of greater corn use. Higher import prices due
to poor harvests last year in major producing nations such as
Argentina made feed makers reluctant to use sorghum.
    Soybean meal use fell to 2.58 mln tonnes from 2.63 mln and
the compounding ratio declined to 10.0 pct from 10.3 pct.
    The drop in soybean meal consumption resulted from
increased use of cheaper rapeseed meal, the officials said.
    Rapeseed consumption in 1986/87 was 563,889 tonnes against
528,152 a year earlier. The compounding ratio rose to 2.2 pct

S and W Berisford Plc <BRFD.L> said a six
pct rise in pretax profits to 42.7 mln stg in the first half
had maintained last year's momentum despite poor commodities
trading conditions and continued rationalisation costs.
    Its British Sugar Corp Plc unit produced its best ever
performance due to greater efficiency and better selling prices
and was on course for record full year profits.
    In the last year Berisford attempted to sell the unit and
attracted several bids. A bid by Hillsdown Holdings Plc
<HLDN.L> was abandoned, one from Tate and Lyle Plc <TATL.L>
officially blocked and a sale of BSC to <Gruppo Ferruzzi> also
prevented.
    It had authorised a further 46 mln stg in capital
expenditure in BSC for next year, eight mln higher than the
anticipated total this year.
    Berisford said it was particularly pleased with the
progress of its associate Hunter Saphir Plc, in which it
acquired a substantial equity stake in January in return for
the sale of some of its food manufacturing companies.

The Finance Ministry is putting the
finishing touches on a roughly 2,000 billion yen supplementary
budget for 1987/88 and has started to turn its attention to
next year's main budget, ministry officials said.
    The supplementary budget is designed to help finance the
6,000 billion yen emergency economic package the government
unveiled last month to boost domestic demand.
    Ministry officials said the government would issue about
1,300 billion yen in construction bonds to help pay for the
increased public investment set out in the emergency package.
    The rest of the supplementary budget will be financed by
450 billion yen in proceeds from last year's sale of shares in
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp (NTT) and by higher than
expected 1986/87 tax revenues, officials said.
    One official said the carry-over of tax revenues into the
1987/88 fiscal year that began on April 1 might be more than
1,000 billion yen. Soaring land and share prices have boosted
receipts, especially from securities and land taxes.
    With less than half of the carry-over likely to be used in
the current supplementary budget, the rest will be available
for a second supplementary budget expected later this year.
    The second supplementary budget will be used to finance the
government's wage bill, which will not be known until after
wage talks later this year, one official said.
    The government must also finance the tax cut of more than
1,000 billion yen which it promised in its emergency package
but which will not be contained in the first supplementary
budget, due to be presented to parliament next month.
    The Finance Ministry's budget bureau is hoping the tax
carry-over and higher than expected revenues again this year
will be enough to finance the second supplementary budget, he
said.
    Officials said the Finance Ministry does not want to issue
deficit-financing bonds or use the extra proceeds from this
year's NTT share sale to fund the second supplementary budget.
    Besides the first supplementary budget, the government also
intends to introduce a new tax reform bill to parliament during
the upcoming extraordinary session, officials said.
    The government was forced to abandon its first tax reform
bill due to strong opposition to its plan to introduce a five
pct sales tax.
    The sales tax was designed to help finance cuts in
individual and corporate income taxes.
    The new bill will present the 1,000 billion yen-plus tax
cut contained in the emergency package as the first step to an
overhaul of the country's tax system, officials said.
    It will also contain a controversial plan to phase out tax
breaks on savings, although it may not take effect in October
as originally planned, they said.
    Looking ahead to next year's main budget, the Finance
Ministry is beginning to debate whether to abandon its
so-called minus ceiling for public investment.
    That policy calls on government departments to cut public
investment spending by five pct per year.
    Economic Planning Minister Tetsuo Kondo said recently the
policy would be suspended in 1988/89, pending a recommendation
from the government's administrative reform council.
    The ruling Liberal Democratic Party said in April that
budget request guidelines for invesment expenditures would be
reviewed.
    But some officials at the Finance Ministry's budget bureau
said they were hopeful the policy would be retained.
    They fear that a suspension of the guidelines for public
investment could lead to increased pressure on the government
to loosen its grip on current expenditures as well.
    The account would also extend interest-free loans to
profitable public works projects developed in conjunction with
the private sector, the officials said.
    In this way, the Finance Ministry could meet growing
pressure on it to boost capital spending while maintaining a
tight grip on outlays by other government departments.
    Surplus funds from this year's sale of NTT shares could
total about 3,000 billion yen. Based on the current market
price, the planned sale of 1.95 mln shares would raise more
than 5,000 billion yen, compared to about 2,000 billion planned
for in the main 1987/88 budget.

Mazda Motor Corp <MAZT.T> predicted a

ending October 31, 1987, down 50.8 pct from a year earlier,
assuming a yen/dollar value at 147 yen, vice president
Yoshihiro Wada told a press conference.
    Sales in 1986/87 were estimated at 1,640 billion yen, up
0.9 pct from a year earlier.
    The company earlier posted a parent net profit of 1.59
billion in the first half ended April 30, down 76.9 pct from a
year earlier, on sales of 804.02 billion, down 4.2 pct.
    The fall was due to the yen rise against the dollar which
cut 55 billion yen off sales, Wada said. The average value of
the dollar was 155 yen in the period from 190 a year earlier.
    Mazda estimated vehicle exports at 1.12 mln, including kit
parts, in the year to October 31, up 6.8 pct from a year
earlier, and domestic sales at 360,000, up 0.8 pct, he said.
    Kit exports should rise because kits sold to Kia Motor Corp

by Mazda, and to a Mexico unit of Ford Motor Co <F> will rise
to 150,000 from 9,000, pushing kit exports up 45.3 pct to

The French government's privatisation
program, which began late last year, has earned the French
State about 52 billion francs to date, the Finance Ministry
said.
    Sources close to Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said the
revenues raised from the privatisation program would be used in
priority to pay off public debt, which stood at 398.2 billion
at the end of 1986.
    The Ministry said in a communique that the returns included
banking group Societe Generale <SGEN.PA>, which began its
two-week public flotation last Monday.
    The government has carried out eight flotations, as well as
the private sale of telephone group <Cie Generale de
Constructions Telephoniques> (CGCT) since its denationalisation
scheme began last December with the sell-off of glass makers
Saint-Gobain <SGEP.PA>, it added.
    The government has pledged to privatise 66 state-owned
industrial, banking and insurance companies by 1991.
    Other companies to be sold to the private sector in the
near future are television network TF-1 later this month and
banking group Cie Financiere de Suez <FSPP.PA> in the autumn.
    The ministry said TF-1's forthcoming sell-off meant that a
third of the government's programme would have been completed
in less than nine months.
    Balladur on Sunday rejected press and opposition charges
that the share prices for privatised companies had been pitched
too low.
    He said that the average premium of shares trading on the
Bourse was between 15 and 30 pct over their offer price. This
compared with premiums of between 60 and 80 pct on similar
share flotations in Britain.

Clearing bank sterling lending to the

billion, the Banking Information Service said.
    The unadjusted rise was 2.77 billion stg, up from 844 mln

lending rose 544 mln stg compared with 471 mln in April.
General consumption went up 399 mln against 355 mln, though

    "There is now recognition that agricultural subsidies must

foreign ministers and their counterparts from six
industrialised countries.
    A delegate said Clark's call for "halting the subsidy war in
the agricultural products" to ensure a stable world trading
system received warm support from Japan and Australia.
    Clark said the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD) has called for "reduction of direct and
indirect subsidies and avoidance of predatory or protectionist
trade practices."
    The OECD stand was endorsed by the Venice economic summit
this month. However, he said he did not expect any quick

not of our making."

aid over thu next five years to developing countries of the

the vessel, en route to New Orleans from Newcastle, New South

A spokesman for Unilever Plc <UN.AS>
declined to comment on market rumours that it may be
considering a bid for the U.S. Health care group The Gillette
Co <GS.N>.
    Gillette shares are traded on the over-the-counter market
in London and this morning stood one dollar higher at 38 dlrs
in response to the bid speculation. Unilever dipped 33p to
3,275 in a generally depressed U.K. Market.
    Most analysts dismissed the rumours saying it was an old
story, and one commented that it was "utter rubbish," adding he
thought Unilever would not be interested in Gillette.
    Gillette shares rose sharply at the beginning of the month
on Wall Street rumours that Sir James Goldsmith was building a
stake in the company.
    Gillette has been the subject of repeated rumours since
Ronald Perelman, chairman of the Revlon Group Inc <REV>, made
an unsuccessful bid for the company last year.

Private Export Funding Corp, PEFCO, is
offering 150 mln dlrs of secured notes due 1994 with an 8.60
pct coupon and par pricing, said J.P. Morgan Securities Inc,
acting as lead manager of its first corporate debt deal.
    "To our knowledge, this is the first time that an affiliate
of a bank holding company has been a manager of a corporate
bond offering in the U.S.," a spokesman for J.P. Morgan and Co
Inc said.
    J.P. Morgan Securities is an affiliate of J.P. Morgan and
Co, the fifth largest bank in the U.S.
    The J.P. Morgan spokesman explained that because the PEFCO
notes are guaranteed by the U.S. government, the securities
affiliate was not prohibited by the Glass-Steagall Act from
underwriting the issue.
    Indeed, Bankers Trust Co and Citicorp Investment Bank,
which are affiliates of Bankers Trust New York Corp and
Citicorp respectively, were co-managers of the PEFCO offering.
    Passed by Congress in 1933, Glass-Steagall bars commercial
banks from owning brokerage firms and engaging in such
investment banking activities as underwriting corporate
securities or municipal revenue bonds.
    Last year, several major U.S. banks formed investment
banking affiliates and applied to the Federal Reserve Board for
authorization to offer commercial paper and underwrite and
trade municipal revenue bonds and some forms of mortgage-backed
securities.
    J.P. Morgan Securities received permission from the Fed
several weeks ago for these activities, the spokesman said.
    But the Securities Industry Association, a trade group of
investment banking firms, appealed the decision. J.P. Morgan
also appealed because it believed the Fed placed too many
restrictions on the bank's affiliate, the spokesman said.
    "The Securities and Exchange Commission got a stay, so we
are not engaging in those activities," the J.P. Morgan
spokesman said.
    "We are perfectly eligable to underwrite this offering. We
are endeavoring to prove that there is nothing mysterious about
this business," the spokesman said.
    He added, "Ruling off certain markets does not serve the
public policy.
    J.P. Morgan Securities was formed in April 1986 with
capitalization of 250 mln dlrs, the spokesman said. At year-end
1986, the firm had 261.5 mln dlrs of capital.
    Dillon, Read and Co Inc, Merrill Lynch Capital Markets and
Salomon Brothers Inc also served as co-managers of the PEFCO
deal.
    The issue's yield was 50 basis points over comparable
Treasury securities. The notes are non-callable for life. A
top-flight AAA rating by Moody's and Standard and Poor's is
anticipated.
    The gross spread is 5.75 dlrs, the selling concession is
3.50 dlrs and the reallowance is two dlrs.
    The spokesman said J.P. Morgan Securities was a member of
an underwriting syndicate for a Sallie Mae issue last year.

British Telecommunications Plc <BTY.L>
said it looked to further progress this year after reporting a
11.7 pct rise in 1986/87 pretax profits to 2.07 billion stg.
    The result was at the top end of market expectations but
the shares nonetheless declined from last night's closing
levels to stand 12p lower at 303p at 1130 GMT.
    Telephone call income rose 9.5 pct to 4.97 billion while
rental income increased 10.6 pct to 3.06 billion.
    The company said it had not paid anything through its
profit-sharing scheme, after 18 mln stg last year, considering
such payments inappropriate after a series of strikes.

    It said total operating costs rose 806 mln stg to 7.08
billion while its basket of across-the-range tariffs had been
reduced overall by 0.3 pct last November under arrangements set
up before privatisation.
    Despite the rise in profits, taxation rose only 11 mln stg
to 754 mln, reflecting the cut in U.K. Corporation tax to 35
pct from 40 pct during the year. Gearing fell to 33 pct from 39
pct. Price regulation formulae were introduced for both the
previously state-owned utilities that have been floated off.
Yesterday, British Gas Plc <BRGS.L> said it was cutting tariffs
for domestic customers by about 4.5 pct.
    BT chairman Sir George Jefferson said work on new digital
exchanges and optical fibre links will continue and the fight
against vandalism of public call boxes would go on.
    "We have been spending 160 mln stg over three years
modernising and expanding our payphone service to make our call
boxes more reliable and harder to vandalise."
    Expenditure on digital exchanges was about 500 mln stg and
progress had been made in installing optical fibre.

Congressional Democratic leaders
announced a compromise has been reached on a 1988 budget,
paving the way for final approval of a trillion dollar spending
plan.
    House Speaker Jim Wright and Senate Majority Leader Robert
Byrd told a news conference that final congressional approval
of the plan to reduce an estimated 171 billion dlr deficit next
year to 134 billion dlr was expected next week.
    The plan was worked out by Democrats who control both House
and Senate but who have been stalemated for a month over
different House and Senate budgets that passed earlier.
    The budget proposes 19.5 billion dlrs in new taxes next
year, 65 billion dlrs over a three year span.
    It would cut President Reagan's request to spend 298
billion dlrs for defense in 1988 by about nine billion dlrs,
but only if he accepts the proposed tax increase to pay for it.
    If Reagan rejects the tax rise, which he has said he would,
defense spending under the plan would drop automatically by
about five billion dlrs, the leaders said.
    Reagan's own budget was rejected by wide margins in both
House and Senate by a combination of Democrats and his own
Republican party who said it was unrealistic.

President Reagan's goal of phasing-out world farm subsidies by

clear they (EC) have no intention of eliminating subsidies,"
said Conrad on his return from a four-day visit to Europe.
    Instead of proposing an end to farm subsidies, he said the
U.S. should adopt some of the EC Common Agricultural Policy,
CAP, principles by seeking a "compromise" agreement with
Brussels to jointly reduce production, and apply a two-price
system of high domestic and low export prices. Under the plan,
export subsidies would bridge domestic and world price gaps,

Aca Joe Inc said Touche Ross and

January 31 because of uncertainty about the company's ability
as a going concern.
    The company, which had previously projected "substantial
losses" for fiscal 1987, said it now expects to report a loss
from operations of about five mln dlrs, or 35 cts a share, on
sales of about 23 mln dlrs. For fiscal 1986, Aca Joe reported a
profit of 860,998 dlrs.
    The company also said it is reviewing its alternatives with
its lenders and financial advisers.
    Aca Joe said it and Touche Ross have not yet resolved the
proper accounting treatment of certain assets on the company's
balance sheet.
    As a result of these unresolved issues, the company said,
it has been unable to finalize its audited financial statements
for fiscal 1987 and file its annual report on form 10-K with
the Securities and Exchange Commission. Aca Joe said it also
has been unable to comply with the SEC's timely filing
requirements of its 10-Q report for the quarter ended May 2.
   
    Involved in the dispute, Aca Joe said, is the
recoverability of intangible assets totalling about five mln
dlrs arising from the acquisition of Aca Joe Intercon Ltd and
Aca Joe Eastern Ltd, and the recoverability of about one mln
dlrs of ACA JOE trademark rights which were purchased by the
company.

Today's U.K. Economic data have pushed
the chances of another base lending rate cut from the current
nine pct further into the distance, analysts said.
    A record fall in unemployment and good manufacturing
production data showed that the economy is still strong and
does not need a fillip from lower rates.
    News that underlying earnings are rising 7.75 pct annually,
taken together with higher than expected bank lending and money
supply growth, revived inflation worries and monetarist
arguments against easier credit, they said.
    "The timetable on lower interest rates is being pushed back
all the while. The strength of the economy and broad money
growth are making it more difficult to see one in the near
term," said Chase Manhattan Securities economist Robin Marshall.
    Analysts have reached this conclusion despite yesterday's
mortgage rate cuts for new borrowers, which building societies
said were a sign of the expected near term trend for U.K.
Rates.
    It also counters the optimistic forecasts of last week that
a post-general election cut was imminent, supported by such
optimistic economic news as May's record reserves rise which
mirrored the Bank of England efforts to cap sterling's
strength.
    The gilt market lost nearly half a point as enthusiasm
about May's 64,300 fall in the seasonally adjusted unemployment
rate, to 2.95 mln or 10.6 pct of the workforce, was rapidly
replaced by dismay at the continued high level of underlying
average earnings in April, dealers said.
    The upset was compounded by news that sterling bank lending
rose 2.7 billion stg in May, above forecast, and that the Bank
of England looks likely to have to sell more gilts to offset
the impact on domestic money supply of its current
intervention.
    "The gilt market reaction was correct," said Bill Martin,
chief U.K. Economist at brokers Phillips and Drew.
    "That's very important ... It shows the economy in a very
good state indeed," Skeoch said.
    "There's no reason to get worries about inflationary
pressures because they're very subdued." Unit wage cost rises
were better than expected, just one pct higher in the year to
April, and it was these costs rather than average earnings
which were potentially inflationary, he added.
    "I don't think these average earnings numbers are a major
problem," agreed Chase Manhattan's Marshall.
    But he said the gilts market was likely to remain worried
about the funding implications of recent intervention.
    He said the inflow of foreign money into sterling assets
earlier this year, attracted by growth prospects and hopes that
the ruling Conservatives would win last week's election, now
looks likely to prevent a base rate cut as the authorities try
to prevent these funds swelling the domestic money system.
    However, David Owen, U.K. Economist at Kleinwort Grieveson
Securities, said any fresh sterling strength would still
trigger a base rate cut and that today's figures did not signal
higher inflation this year.
    "Wage increases are being offset by productivity growth. As
long as that continues we're okay," he added.

New York Federal Reserve President E.
Gerald Corrigan said he favors bank reform but wants to
maintain the separation of banking and commerce.
    "As I see it, the case for fundamental reform in our banking
and financial system is compelling," Corrigan told the Senate
Banking Committee.
    Corrigan said he believed bank reform should allow banks to
offer a broad range of banking and financial services.
    He said common ownership of banks, thrifts, securities
firms and insurance companies should be allowed but commercial
firms should not own or control insured depositories.
    Committee Chairman William Proxmire (D-Wisc) said he would
press for bank reform legislation this year and supported
giving banks new power for commercial paper, mortgage-backed
securities, municipal bond underwriting and mutual funds.
    Former Citicorp Chairman Walter Wriston said bank reform
should reflect the reality that other companies were offering
banking services such as checking accounts credit cards and
mortgages.
         
    "The reality is that there is one-stop financial shopping at
banks in some states, but not in others," Wriston said.
    "There is also one-stop financial shopping in all 50 states
at a Sears store or American Express office."
    "We must find ways for banks to deliver new products to new
customers in order to maintain a spread of risk in a business
that is rapidly losing traditional products and customers," he
said.

Atlantic Richfield Co, considering a
spin-off of a 20 pct interest in its chemical operations, could
gain about 500 mln dlrs from the deal, industry analysts
estimated.
    Yesterday ARCO's stock jumped as much as five points on
rumors it was spinning off the chemical operations. Based on
about 183 mln outstanding shares, the market in its frenzy was
valuing the spin-off at about 900 mln dlrs, analysts said.
    Atlantic Richfield, aware of the rumors, issued a statement
around mid-day that it was considering a sale of only 20 pct of
the unit, leading investors to take profits.
    After the announcement, the company's stock retreated,
closing at 93-7/8, up 1-3/8. Today it was off 1/4.
    "It was a smaller deal than expected and somewhat
disappointing," said analyst George Baker at Smith Barney. He
said rumors of the spin-off had been around "for a couple of
days."
    Baker said the unit was very profitable but it wasn't
getting the type of exposure Atlantic Richfield sought, and its
value was not reflected in the company's stock price.
    Industry analyst Richard Pzena of Sanford C. Bernstein said
the unit had operating earnings of 132 mln dlrs last year and
he expected it to earn about 175 mln dlrs this year.
    Based on a multiple of 17 times earnings--which Pzena says

Regulations governing hedging and risk
management should be revised and development of new futures
instruments cautiously monitored in dealing with the growth of
off-exchange futures instruments, Robert Davis, a commissioner
on the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, CFTC, said.
    Davis told the Chicago chapter of the Futures Industry
Association Commodity Research Division last night "there is no
cause for undue alarm" in the growth of off-exchange
instruments.
    However, he said, the CFTC "must clarify jurisdictional and
regulatory issues" by maintaining the safeguards intended by
commodity regulations while encouraging "the further
development of competitive markets."
    "There is not a single off-exchange issue, there cannot be
one policy approach, and to the extent that problems exist,
there cannot be one solution," Davis said.
    The development of off-exchange instruments with futures
contract characteristics has become of increasing concern to
federal regulators who are trying to define what issues are
covered under existing regulations and where new regulations
are needed to protect private investment.
    Davis said the CFTC should step up enforcement where
off-exchange instruments are intended to compete with
exchange-traded issues, correct "regulatory inflexibility"
which may force new instruments off exchange, and "delineate
and separate those harmful off-exchange developments from the
many that are not."
    "We cannot ignore that some of the growth of off-exchange
trading represents a desirable further development of financial
forward contracts that complement, rather than compete with,
the relatively new financial futures contracts," Davis said.
    He said a CFTC task force is continuing its investigation
of the off-exchange issue.

General Motors Corp said it will
permanently lay off 850 hourly workers in August at its car

    GM, the largest U.S. automaker but suffering from lower
sales for months, said 350 of the 3,800 workers at the
Janesville plant would be put on indefinite layoff effective
August 11 as the production rate for 1988-model Cadillac

five units per hour.

    GM said it will begin that date its production of
1988-model Chevrolet Cavalier and Pontiac Sunbirds on two
shifts with a cut of six units an hour from the current rate.
   GM also said it will change its method for reporting
indefinite layoffs to monthly releases from the previous weekly
system "to achieve more complete, accurate and less-confusing
reporting of production-schedule adjustments."

Global Yield Fund, in a review of its
dividend policy, told shareholders that under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, the fund must distribute substantially
all of its net income by the end of each year.
    Under the new tax law, the company said annual net income
includes net investment income from interest less expenses, plu
or minus any ordinary currency gains or losses realized in
connection with the sale of debt securities.
   
    The company said its present dividend policy is to make
distributions of net investment income to stockholders
quarterly and to accumulate any realized ordinary currency
gains for distribution as net income at the end of the year.
    At present time, the company said such currency gains
amount to about 40 cts per share.
    However, any currency net loss realized during the
remaining six and a half month period between now and the end
of the year could not only reduce or eliminate distributions
from this source but could reduce distributions from net
investment income, the company said.
   
    According to Global, the board would determine on an annual
basis whether to distribute or retain net long-term realized
capital gains.
    In other matters, the company said its shareholders at its
first annual meeting elected nine directors, approved the
investment management agreement with <Prudential Insurance Co
of America>, and the service agreement between Prudential and
the <Prudential Investment Corp>.
   
    Shareholders also approved the administration agreement
with <Prudential-Bache Securities Inc> and amended the fund's

securities while borrowings are outstanding, the company said.

Sykes Datatronics Inc said it
has agreed in principle for Marshall Associates and H and M
resources Inc to each purchase up to one mln dlrs of its
convertible debentures, allowing Sykes to pay in full its debt
to Chase Manhattan Corp <CMB> and Chemical New York Corp <CHL>.
    The company said at closing, each investor will buy 750,000
dlrs of convertible debentures bearing interest at three points
over the prime rate.  It said interest only is payable until
June 1, 1990, when repayment of principal in 20 quarterly
installments.
    Sykes said the remaining 250,000 dlrs of each commitment
may be drawn down at Sykes' option after December 1, 1987 if
the company has met certain performance levels.
    It said the debentures are convertible into common stock at
15 cts per share.  It said if it has now drawn all of the
remaining 500,000 dlrs of debentures, the investor can buy
whatever amount of debentures remain unsold and immediately
convert  them to Sykes stock.
    Sykes said if both investors were to convert all of the
debentures, they would own 13.3 mln Sykes shares.  Sykes now
has 13.0 mln shares outstanding.
    Sykes said, however, that the agreement with the investors
provides that the number of shares resulting from the
conversion of the debentures may not be in an amount that would
limit Sykes' ability to use its net operating loss carryforward
under the Tax Reform Act of 1986.  The provisioin would
prevcent the investor from owning more than 50 pct of Sykes'
shares immediately after conversion, it said.
    The company said closing of the trasaction is expected
before July 1, subject to the receipt of a fairness opinion
from an investment banker, Moseley Holdings Corp <MOSE.O>.
    Sykes said it will use 1,100,000 dlrs of the initial
1,500,000 dlrs in proceeds, together with a 200,000 dlr note,
to pay in full all its debt to Chase and Chemical.  The banks
will then release their security interests in sykes assets,
which will be pledged to the two new investors instead, it

West Germany's proposed tax reform should
be brought forward to stimulate economic growth and head off
U.S.-led pressure on Bonn to take further fiscal steps to help
boost the world economy, the Ifo economic institute said.
    An Ifo report said, "The total growth effect of the reform
could be considerably enhanced, and international pressure on
the government therefore reduced, if a larger portion of the
tax cuts planned by 1990 were brought forward to 1988."
    Swift action is required to remove growing doubts about how
the 44 billion mark tax reform will be financed, Ifo said.
    The report says the tax reform will be insufficient and too
late to stimulate economic growth, as demanded by West
Germany's industrial partners.
    Since the lion's share of cuts worth a gross 44 billion
marks "will not go into effect before 1990, their impact on
growth will be too little, too late," said Ifo.
    The West German government has consistently said that by
cutting taxes and encouraging consumer spending it is boosting
domestic demand and making a significant contribution to world
economic growth.
    Bonn has agreed to increase the scope of tax reductions
planned for 1988. In March, the government said 1988 tax cuts
would be expanded by 5.2 billion marks to 13.7 billion.
    A month later, economics minister Martin Bangemann
countered a joint call from all five German economic institutes
to speed up tax cuts by saying such a step would endanger
efforts to consolidate the budget and keep new public borrowing
down.
    Financing the tax reform has become an "acute problem," Ifo
said.
    "Currently, every proposal over financing (the reform) comes
up against political opposition. There will be a lot more
criticism before the outstanding 19.4 billion marks needed to
finance the reform has been accounted for," the report said.
    The government has pledged to agree by the Autumn how to
raise around 19 billion marks still needed to finance tax cuts.
Subsidies paid to ailing industries are the major target.
    But even leading coalition members like Matthias Wissmann,
economics spokesman for the ruling Christian Democratic party,
have conceded that subsidy cuts exceeding five billion marks
are unrealistic, leaving a remaining 14 billion marks to be
found.
    An increase in public borrowing will be inevitable to help
finance the tax cuts, but Bonn should be able to cope with
this, the report said.
    Despite vigorous opposition from the Free Democrats, the
junior partners in the centre-right coalition government, Bonn
will eventually be forced to increase value added tax (VAT) due
to tax harmonisation measures within the European Community. A
VAT increase will also provide funds for income tax reform, the
report said.
    Viewed in the context of efforts by Bonn, Washington and
Tokyo to reform taxes, "despite its various shortcomings, West
Germany's planned tax reform is better than its reputation," Ifo
said.
    The effective cut in the income tax burden carried by West
Germans will be greater than in the U.S., Although the rate
reductions are smaller and income tax levels will remain higher
overall, the report said.

The European Parliament threatened to
block European Community spending plans for next year and
implied it could also hold up attempts to solve an
ever-deepening budget crisis this year.
    The Parliament voted unanimously in favour of a resolution
condemning the annual haggling and compromising between the
Community's 12 member states on spending levels.
    "It is no longer possible to resort to short-term measures
or to provisional budgetary solutions. It is no longer possible
to accept a budget in which real expenditure is not covered by
revenue," the resolution said.
    Parliamentary blocking could jeopardise efforts to solve a
financing crisis over a five billion European Currency Unit
(ECU) shortfall for this year, diplomats said. EC ministers are
deadlocked on the issue.
    It also would plunge the EC into an ever-deepening crisis
next year. Without parliamentary approval of the 1988 budget,
the Community would be forced into emergency measures, with
spending set according to the previous year's levels.
    British conservative parliamentarian Peter Price told
reporters that parliament could delay an emergency package
until EC ministers prove they are ready to find a long-term
solution.

The U.K. High Court dismissed an appeal
by Rio Tinto-Zinc Corp Plc's <RTZL.L> RTZ Oil and Gas Ltd unit
and ruled that the financial provisions a company makes for the
future cost of abandoning an oil field are not tax deductible,
the Press Association reported.
    The company was appealing against a decision of the Tax
Commissioners that any such provision was a capital
expenditure, not a revenue expenditure, and was not deductible.
The court was told that since 1976 the company had made an
annual provision of around 750,000 stg for the eventual cost of
abandoning a rig.
    An RTZ spokesman said the ruling was not worrying as the
subsidiary had assumed that the provisions were not deductible
from corporation tax payable.
    It would have been a bonus if the company had won but all
budgeting had been on the assumption that it would not, he
said.
    Oil analysts said that RTZ's assumption of liability was
shared by the industry as a whole.
    The ruling appeared to mean that tax relief on the
expensive process of abandoning rigs would apply when the
expense occurred, not when provisions for future expenses were
built into the accounts, one analyst added.

Salomon Inc had a reduction in trading
revenue in April and May, managing director Robert Salomon said
in response to questions.
    Analysts have said they believe the lower second quarter
profit predicted by Salomon Inc was partially the result of
trading losses and lower revenues from low trading volume. They
said they believe the firm, like others on Wall Street,
suffered most from the turbulent weeks for the bond market in
April.
    Robert Salomon would not comment on whether the firm had
actual trading losses, but he said he would not "quarrel" with
a New York Times article that said the firm's losses could have
amounted to 100 mln dlrs.
    "We haven't acknowledged any trading losses other than to
say that April was a difficult month, and you can presume
anything you want from that. we don't have a quarrel with the
new york times article," Salomon said.
     "There cleary was a reduction in the amount of revenues
generated in April and May was a little bit better," he said.
    The New York times attributed the figure to analysts and
unnamed Wall Street officials it said were familiar with the
firm's activities.
    Salomon Chairman John Gutfreund today in a statement
reiterated that the firm expects a profit in the second quarter
but sees lower earnings than last year's second quarter.
Analysts lowered their estimates yesterday to about half of
last year's 75 cts per share.
    "We believe this showing is satisfactory within the
framework of existing market conditions," said Gutfreund in a
statement.

The Federal Trade Commission charged
Kraft Inc with false and misleading advertising by overstating
the calcuim content of its Kraft Singles cheese product.
    In an administrative complaint, the FTC charged the
Glenview, Ill., food and consumer products company with
claiming that a slice of Kraft Singles American Pasteurized
Process Cheese Food (Kraft Singles) contains the same amount of
calcium as five ounces of milk, when it does not.
    The company also falsely advertised that Kraft Singles
contained more calcium than do most imitation cheese slices,
the FTC charged.
    The FTC complaint also charged that Kraft said it could
substantiate these claims when, in fact, it could not.
    "Nutritional information is important to consumers, but it
can be difficult for them to verify." FTC Bureau of Consumer
Protection Director William MacLeod said in a statement. "That
is why we seek to maintain the accuracy of nutritional claims."
    The FTC, which voted 4-1 in favor of issuing the complaint,
generally takes such action when it has reason to believe that
the law has been or is being violated and where it apears to
the commission that a proceeding is in the public interest.
    The filing of an administrative complaint marks the
beginning of a proceeding that often takes up to a year in
which the allegations will be ruled upon after a formal
hearing.
    If the commission's allegations are upheld, Kraft could be
prohibited from misrepresenting the calcium or other nutrient
content of its cheese-type products, including those made in
comparative ads.
    The company could also be prohibited from making such
claims without having competent and reliable scientific
evidence.

The West Texas cotton crop was largely
unscathed by an isolated thunderstorm in that region last night
that packed hurricane-force winds, crop and weather experts
said.
    "There might have been some isolated storms, but certainly
nothing damaging," said Charles Stichler, an extension
agronomist with the Agricultural Extension Service in far West
Texas.
    Rumors of a damaging storm in West Texas helped the New
York cotton futures market rally sharply this morning.
   Cotton for December delivery was 1.35 cents higher at 70.95
cents a lb at midsession after peaking this morning at 71.25
cents.
    "What happened is that the storm hit Lubbock airport, and
when that happens, everybody sees it," said Dale Mohler, a
senior meteorologist with Accu-Weather Inc.
    Lubbock is the heart of the West Texas cotton region, which
produces about 80 pct of that state's crop.
    The storm produced winds of about 75 mph. "That's hurricane
force. But they were isolated to just a small portion of the
West Texas area, probably less than five pct," Mohler said.
    "No doubt there was some damage. But if it had hit in July
or August (when fruiting would be underway) it would have been
worse," Mohler said.
    About 60 pct of the West Texas cotton crop has been
planted, and the remainder could be done by the weekend if
weather remains hot and dry, Stichler said.
    The temperature in West Texas since mid-week has been about
95 degrees. But a hot spell was sorely needed after far heavier
than normal rainfall for several weeks, he said.

A compromise reached between Gulf Canada
Corp and debenture holders at the annual meeting today will
cost the company or its major shareholder "a couple of million"
dollars, chairman Marshall Cohen said.
    After about a half-hour discussion with debenture holders
during the meeting, Cohen and Gulf lawyers agreed to compensate
them for about six months of interest that they would have lost
under a corporate reorganization plan taking effect July one.
The holders then withdrew a proposed amendment that sought to
delay the plan's closing to July 16 so they could collect
interest due to be paid July 15.
    "We have not sorted out the mechanics of how we're going to
do this," Cohen told reporters later.
    "It may well be that in the end the principal shareholder
may absorb that interest," he said, referring to the Reichmann
family's Olympia and York Developments Ltd, which owns about 79
pct of Gulf Canada.                                     Cohen
said he wanted to ensure that Gulf Canada need not revise
reorganization proposals already on file with Revenue Canada
and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
    "If Gulf can't pay it (the interest) without upsetting the
applecart, Olympia and York will pay," he said.
    The reorganization will see Gulf Canada Corp renamed Gulf
Canada Resources Ltd. Shareholders will be offered shares of
three separate publicly traded companies, Gulf Canada
Resources, Abitibi-Price Inc <A.TO> and GW Utilities Ltd.
    Newly formed GW Utilities will hold Gulf Canada's interests
in Consumers' Gas Co Ltd <CGT.TO>, Hiram Walker-Gooderham and
Worts Ltd and Interprovincial Pipe Line Ltd <IPL.TO>.
    Cohen said Olympia and York's interest in Gulf Canada
Resources will slip to about 68 or 69 pct as a result of a
previously announced plan to sell 450 mln dlrs of new stock.
                             
    In answer to a reporter's question, Cohen said there was a
possibility that the size of the offering could be increased.
    "There seems to be pretty strong interest," he said, but he
added that much depended upon market conditions at the time of
pricing. The issue will be priced later this month, according
to a company official.

A trade-led boom in the U.S. is
unlikely this year or next because growth in net exports will
merely offset a dramatic slowdown in consumer spending and
other sectors of the economy, Bank of America said in its
latest economic report.
    Although net exports will add 0.7 pct to GNP this year,
after reducing it by 1.2 pct in 1986, consumer spending will
contribute 1.4 pct less to GNP than it did last year.
    As a result, GNP this year is likely to expand a modest 2.5
pct, the same rate as last year, according to Daniel Van Dyke,
the Bank of America economist who wrote the report.
    "Growth in consumer spending in the United States will drop
dramatically this year because the jump in inflation will cause
a falloff in the growth of disposable income," Van Dyke said.
    Growth in U.S. consumer spending is likely to slow to 1.8
pct this year from 4.1 pct in 1986, he predicted.
    The report was released before the Commerce Department
reported today that personal income rose just 0.2 pct in May,
after increasing 0.4 pct in April, and that personal
consumption expenditures had risen just 0.1 pct, compared with
a 0.6 pct increase the month before.
    The rising cost of energy and imports is likely to boost
consumer prices by an average of 3.7 pct this year, up from 1.9
pct in 1986, Bank of America forecast.
    This rise in inflation will reduce real disposable income 
growth to only 1.3 pct in 1987 from 2.9 pct in 1986.
    As a result, Van Dyke calculated that the purchasing power
of an average family of four will increase by a modest 540 dlrs
this year compared to a surge of 1,210 dlrs during 1986.
    The slowdown in income growth is likely to cause housing
starts to drop by 4.2 pct this year and a further six pct in
1988 to an annual rate of 1.63 mln units.
    "For the first time in several years, a recession in 1988
or 1989 is more than a remote possibility," Van Dyke said.
    Currently, U.S. growth is fragile and depends heavily on an
improvement in trade. "However, with protectionist attitudes on
the rise in this country, this source of growth is at risk," he
added.

Brooklyn Union Gas Co, a New York gas
utility, will see its gas costs up sharply as a result of
Transco Energy Co's <E> decision to close its pipelines to
transport spot gas sales, energy industry analysts said.
    Brooklyn Union, the fourth largest gas utility in the
United States, purchased 36 pct of its supplies on the spot, or
non-contract, market in 1986, and the proportion of spot
supplies was estimated much higher in the five months of 1987,
analysts said.
    Texas Eastern pipelines <TET>, the other competing
pipeline, to deliver spot gas from producing areas in the South
closed its gate station for summer, and Brooklyn Union has
relied entirely on Transco for spot supplies.
     In the month of May, Brooklyn Union paid about two dlrs
per mln British Thermal Unit for spot gas, while contract gas
costs four to five dlrs per mln BTU, industry sources said.
    Transco announced yesterday it would no longer provide open
access to transport spot natural gas to its customers for fear
of accumulating more take-or-pay liabilities.
    Take-or-pay contracts oblige pipelines to pay producers for
gas even if delivery is not taken by its customers.
    Brooklyn Union will continue receiving a small amount of
supplies from minor fields under a grandfather clause, a
Brooklyn Union official said.
    Foster Corwith, gas analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said
most of the rising cost to Booklyn Union will be passed through
to rate payers.
    While net effect on the company will not be known for
several months because of the time lag in deferred earnings,
end-users, especially residential and commercial customers,
will end up paying more for gas, he said.
    Because the closure takes place in summer months when gas
demand is at seasonal low, the impact on cash flow would be
small, Curt Launer, natural gas analyst with Donaldson Lufkin
Jenrette, said.
    If the situation persists into winter heating season, high
cost gas could cut in the company's profits, he said.
    Gas utilities along eastern seaboard relying on Transco for
spot gas, such as North Carolina Natural Gas Co <NCNG>,
Piedmont Natural Gas Co <PNY>, will face the same high cost
factor as Brooklyn Union, Steve Richards, a supply manager with
end users supply system, a Houston based natural gas brokering
firm, said.
    "But these companies are not unwitting victims of the
take-or-pay dispute between Transco and producers," he said.
    Distributors have turned a deaf ear to Transco's request
for an inventory charge, which reserves the pipeline facility
for spot gas to be delivered to these companies, he said.
    Without spot supplies, the high cost of system gas will
threaten to drive away large customers capable of shifting to
alternative fuels, he said.
    In absence of any guidelines on inventory charges from the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the matter is being
negotiated between pipelines and customers, Richards said.
    Now that Transco has refused to transport cheap spot gas
for them, these distributors are likely to be more conciliatory
on the inventory charge, he said.
    "Cool heads will prevail," DLJ's Launer said, " but it may
take a while."

Shares of Glaxo Holdings PLC fell
following a report in today's New England Journal of Medicine
that antibiotics may be able to treat ulcers, threatening 
Glaxo's billion dlr antiulcer drug Zantac, analysts said.
    Glaxo's was trading at 27-7/8, off 1/2, on volume of
1,786,800 shares. Shares of SmithKline Beckman <SKB>, maker of
the popular anti-ulcer drug Tagamet, also fell 7/8 to 60-1/4.
    "Anything that raises the possiblity of an entirely new
therapy for ulcers would attack the core of Glaxo's worldwide
business, which is Zantac," said David MacCallum, an analyst
who follows Glaxo for Hambrecht and Quist.
   
    Zantac is the world's most prescribed drug with annual
sales of over one billion dollars, accounting for almost 75 pct
of Glaxo's earnings, said MacCallum.
    "If there is any perception that Zantac is not the therapy
of choice for ulcers, Glaxo's sales and profits could decline,"
said Tina Rizopuolos, an analyst with Alexanders Laing and
Or'kshnk.
    Rizopuolos said the New England Journal article, led by a
University of Toronto researcher, concludes from a study of 71
children with gastric disease that bacteria could cause
gastritis and ulcers.
   
    In an editorial in the same issue of the medical journal,
Richard Hornick of the University of Rochester School of
Medicine, reviewed studies using antibiotics to treat ulcers.
Rizopuolos said Hornick concludes that the bacteria ulcer
relationship is "exciting and intriguing," but further studies
are needed to show a direct causal effect.
    Ulcers happen when the stomach's protective lining erodes
and is exposed to underlying inflamed tissue, but it is unknown
what actually causes the process.
   
It is known that stomach acids exacerbate ulcers and therefore
antacids were commonly used to alleviate ulcers before Tagamet
and Zantac came along. Both of these drugs prevent the release
of the hormone histamine in the stomach, which triggers acid
secretion.
    "I don't think people should run out and sell Glaxo," said
analyst Rizopuolos. "It will take a long time to displace
Tagamet and Zantac...those drugs are going to be prescribed by
physicians for a long time," she added.

Ronald Perelman, head of Revlon Group
Inc <REV>, may be trying to ignite a bidding war for Gillette
Co that could draw some big international players and in the
process make a lot of money for himself, Wall Street analysts
said.
    Several hours before a regularly scheduled board of
directors meeting, Gillette disclosed that Perelman requested
consent of its board for an offer of at least 40.50 dlrs per
share. Perelman needed the consent because he agreed in
November not to buy stock for 10 years without permission.
    "I think Ronald Perelman is less interested in Gillette and
more interested in putting Gillette into play because he stands
to make a ton of money," said Andrew Shore, analyst at Shearson
Lehman Brothers Inc. "In play" is a term used on Wall Street to
describe what happens when a company becomes an unwiling
takeover target.
    Shore noted that according to the 1986 agreement Revlon
gets paid if there is any acquisition of Gillette through
November of this year at a price higher than 29.75 dlrs per
share. Gillette rose three to 40 today, following a gain of
three yesterday.
    The agreement would be calculated on the basis of
Perelman's previous holding of 18.4 mln shares, adjusted for a
split. For example, a deal between Gillette and some other
company at 44 dlrs per share would make Revlon richer by 262
mln dlrs under the formula. Neither Perelman nor his spokesmen
returned telephone calls seeking comment.
    "Revlon stands to make a substantial amount of money if
someone else takes over Gillette," said Analyst Deepak Raj of
Merrill Lynch and Co. "I'm not saying that is going to happen
but Gillette is an undervalued stock with a breakup value of 45
dlrs per share."
    Shore of Shearson Lehman said there are a couple of reasons
why Perelman may not be really interested in acquiring
Gillette. He said Perelman, in the process of taking Revlon
private after acquiring control of the cosmetics company two
years ago, probably wants to concentrate on improving Revlon's
operations. "He's trying to overhaul and improve the image of
the dearptment store business." Another reason is that Revlon
has recently made two other acquisitions.
    Under those circumstances, Shore would not be surprised if
some company such as Unilever plc <UN.AS> or Procter and Gamble
Co <PG> decided to take a look at Gillette.
    Shore mentioned half a dozen other potential buyers for
Gillette including Sir James Goldsmith, Hanson Trust plc <HAN>,
RJR Nabisco Inc <RJR>, American Brands Inc <AMB> and Ralston
Purina Co <RAL>.
    "Perelman is trying to put the company in play," said a
Wall Street arbitrageur. "He gets to share in the upside if the
company is sold." Another arbitrageur said he expects Gillette
to resist Perelman's overture. "I can't see the board
consenting, what has changed between November and now," he
said.
   
    Another arbitrageur said he was not sure what was going on.
"Perelman never does anything without a fair amount of
calculation," he said. But he added, "The Gillette board has to
be careful. They just can't say no or they'll be sued by
shareholders." Gillette's board was still meeting at 1700 EDT,
three and one-half hours after the scheduled starting time.
    According to a copy of Perelman's letter released by
Gillette, he would be prepared to sign a defnitive merger
agreement without any financing condition. He said Citibank
N.A. is his lead lender and First Boston Inc is his financial
adviser.

PNC Financial Corp said it will raise
its loan loss reserve by 110 mln dlrs to about 386 mln dlrs,
reducing second quarter results by 66 mln dlrs or 92 cts per
share on a fully diluted basis.
    The company said that after the charge it still expects to
report a second quarter profit and expects a first half profit
of about 100 mln dlrs.
    It added that it expects normal operating earnings in the
second half.
    The company earned 68.5 mln dlrs in the 1986 second quarter
and 121.6 mln dlrs in the prior first half.
    It said the increase in loss reserves was due to its
appraisal of the worldwide economy, particularly in less
developed countries that are experiencing payment problems.
    The company said the part of its loss reserve allocated to
such countries is about 35 pct of its loans to those countries.
It said the move would not result in any change to its current

A.H. Robins Co, facing suits over its
Dalkon Shield birth control device, said a Federal Court of
Appeals approved of the way the company notified potential
victims about a possible liability.
    The notification of potential claimants, which began in
january 1986 and ended several months later, was challenged by
some claimant committees who said the company's program was
inadequate.
    A company spokesman said A.H. Robins was pleased with the
ruling, noting an unfavorable decision would have "set the
whole thing back for quite some time."
    The ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the fourth
circuit, which upheld a lower court, said, "the notification
program used by Robins was ... reasonable.
    "The evidence indicates that every news outlet in the world
received the information. Simiarly, there is strong evidence
that the news was broadly disseminated worldwide.
    "Women from such unlikely locations as Kenya, Botswana,
Pakistan and Bangladesh ultimately filed claims. A battery of
world health and welfare organizations also disseminated the
information. It appears to this Court that the extensive
notification program was a success."

Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, defended his
controversial mandatory supply control farm bill and said U.S.
farmers should be allowed to vote in a referendum whether they
approve of the proposal.
    The Harkin proposal would set loan rates of 5.17 dlrs per
bushel for wheat, 3.77 dlrs for corn and 9.32 dlrs for
soybeans, all to be put in effect under strict controls on
planted acreage reductions. Present loan rates are 2.28 dlrs
for wheat, 1.92 for corn, and effectively 4.56 for soybeans.
    Also under the plan, the U.S. would seek a world market
sharing cartel with the European Community and other exporting
nations, to share-out export markets, Harkin said during the
first of several Senate Agriculture subcommittee hearings
examining farm programs.
    Harkin made the following claims in testimony on his
"Family Farm Act."
    -- The mandatory control bill would increase farm income
and reduce government spending on agriculture.
    -- Harkin said his policy of high price supports would not
ruin U.S. agricultural exports as critics claim, but would
increase overall revenue from exports.
    This would be done by seeking agreement among major
exporting countries including the European Community on market
sharing at agreed high prices.
    Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo., countered during the hearing
that such a grain export cartel is not workable.
    -- Harkin acknowledged that higher commodity price supports
would be passed onto consumers, but he said high food prices
stem more from "gouging" by food processing companies than from
high farm product prices.
    Harkin cited what he termed "excessive" net returns on
equity over five years of 33.4 pct at Kellogg, 31.9 pct
Monfort, 22.8 pct Nabisco, 22.8 pct ConAgra, 21.2 pct H.J.
Heinz, 19.1 pct Ralston Purina, 17.2 pct Pillsbury and 16.7 pct
Quaker Oats.
    -- Harkin said a "legitimate" concern about his bill would
be the impact of higher prices on livestock producers.
    He said as a transition to the higher prices, he would
allow livestock producers to purchase Commodity Credit Corp.
grain stocks for three years.
    Thereafter, livestock farmers would benefit from a
"predictable and stable" grain price, he said.
    -- Harkin said that under his policy approach farm
participation would be no more "mandatory" than the current
farm program. He said farmers now must participate in farm
programs in order to receive credit for planting and to protect
farm income.

France's growth rate is expected to
strengthen in the second half of this year after a poor first
half, but unemployment will worsen, the Organisation for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said.
    In its semi-annual review of the world economy, the OECD
forecast that growth in the French Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
would run at about two pct in the next six months. It said the
rate would be in line with the 1986 trends, but significantly
higher than in the first half of this year.
    The OECD said France's economic situation has deteriorated
somewhat during the early months of 1987. 
    Activity has slowed, primarily reflecting an inventory
adjustment, while unemployment has risen rapidly and inflation
has reaccelerated, the OECD said. Unemployment is likely to
reach 12 pct of the workforce by the end of 1988.
    The report said inflation should slow and domestic demand
pick up in the second half of this year. But both data are
likely to be worse than those recorded in 1986, it added.
    The OECD forecast a 2.75 pct rise in consumer prices for
the second half of this year, a one pct drop from the first six
months. The slowdown would bring the inflation rate to 3.25 pct
for the whole year, sharply up from last year's 2.2 pct.

revenues by about five billion dlrs over the next five years by
broadening the tax base and allowing fewer exemptions, finance
minister Michael Wilson said.
     As Wilson previously promised, he said corporations will
bear an increased tax burden, despite new measures to lower
overall tax rates.
     Increased corporate revenues will result from broadening
the tax base and eliminating special tax exemptions.
     "The jobs of many Canadians depend on a corporate income
tax system that is competitive with other countries,
particularly the United States," Wilson said in a prepared
speech to the House of Commons.
     "And it (tax reform) will ensure that profitable
corporations carry a bigger share of the total tax burden," he
added.
     Federal tax revenue from corporations will increase by 470
mln dlrs in the fiscal year ending March 31, 1988, 410 mln dlrs
in fiscal 1989 and 1.19 billion dlrs in fiscal 1990, according
to documents tabled with Wilson's speech.

The average tax rate for Canadian
financial insitutions will increase to 21.3 pct from 14.5 pct
under the new tax reform package, the federal finance
department said.
     The amount of financial institutions' income that is taxed
will also increase to 74.0 pct from 48.7 pct, it said in
documents tabled with finance minister Michael Wilson's
prepared speech to the House of Commons.
     Under Wilson's plan, the federal government will collect
1.36 billion dlrs more over the next five years from financial
insitutions, including banks, trust mortgage and life insurance
companies, according to finance department documents.
     Financial institutions "are going to complain, but we
believe the changes are appropriate and affordable," said one
finance department official who asked not to be identified.
     Ottawa will collect more revenue from financial
institutions by reducing the amount of reserves they can deduct
from taxes, which "will broaden the tax base for this low tax
paying sector," the finance department said.
     Among the changes, chartered banks will no longer be able
to use a five-year averaging formula to calculate loan losses
that may be deducted for tax purposes.
     Effective June 17, 1987, banks will deduct bad or doubtful
loans during the year they are incurred.
     The finance department said the impact of the new
provisions will be cushioned over a period of five years.
     The changes are needed to ensure that all financial
companies are taxed fairly under deregulation of the financial
services industry.
     "It would be inconsistent for the tax system to continue
to provide different reserves for tax purposes for institutions
competing in the same marketplace," the finance department
said.

Canada will broaden a federal sales tax
levied on manufacturers before scrapping the system in favor of
a broad based, multi-staged sales tax, finance minister Michael
Wilson said.
     As expected, Wilson did not include a new sales tax system
as part of his wide-ranging tax reforms tabled in the House of
Commons today.
    Instead, the federal government will make interim changes
to the existing sales tax to make it more fair for low and
middle income Canadians.
    "The present (sales) tax is fundamentally flawed. It is a
hidden, arbitrary and capricious tax," Wilson told the House of
Commons.
    The existing federal sales tax system hurts the Canadian
economy by putting more tax on Canadian produced goods than
imported goods and adding a hidden tax on Canadian exports that
makes them less competitive, Wilson said.
     Interim changes effective January 1, 1988 will include:
     -- applying the federal sales tax to marketing companies
related to manufacturers
     -- levying the tax at the wholesale level instead of the
manufacturer for a selected range of products
     -- applying a 10 pct sales tax to telecommunication
services, except for residential telephone lines
     -- quicker collection of federal sales taxes.
     To offset these changes for low income Canadians,
refundable tax credits will be increased to 70 dlrs from 50
dlrs for adults and to 35 dlrs from 25 dlrs for children, the
finance department said.
     Ottawa is considering three alternative forms for a new
sales tax, including a goods and services tax, a value added
tax and a national sales tax that would combine existing
federal and provincial levies into one system, Wilson told the
House of Commons.
     He said the federal government will explore the
possibility of one national sales tax with Canada's 10
provincial governments. All provinces except Albeta now levy a
provincial sales of tax of varying amounts.
     Wilson said one joint system would be simpler for
taxpayers and maximize economic benefits of tax reform.
     If Ottawa and the provinces can't agree on a national
sales tax system, Wilson said the federal government will
consider either a goods and services tax or a value-added tax.
     A goods and services tax would apply at one rate to
virtually all goods and services in Canada and would include
further increases in refundable tax credits for low and middle
income Canadians, the finance department said in documents
accompanying Wilson's speech.
     A federal value-added tax, similar to European tax
systems, would also be broad based but would allow more
flexibility to exempt selected goods and services, the
department said. The finance deparment said the main drawback
of a value added tax is that it would be more complex and
costly to implement than the other two proposals.

Finance Minister Michael Wilson said tax
reform will not affect his determination to reign in
expenditures, but his forecasts show a slowing of the decline
in the budget deficit in the late 1980s.
    "Responsible tax reform must be fiscally responsible,"
Wilson said in a speech prepared for the House of Commons.
    Wilson estimated the deficit will fall to 29.3 billion dlrs
in the year ending March 31, 1988, the same level as he
forecast in the February budget.
    And in the year ended this past March, the deficit was
expected to have been one billion dlrs lower than the 32
billion dlr shortfall originally forecast, Wilson said.
    Wilson said in the current 1988 fiscal year
higher-than-anticipated spending, particularly in farm income
support programs, will be offset by higher-than-anticipated
revenues.
    But finance department documents show the pace of deficit
reduction was expected to slow temporarily in fiscal 1989 and
1990 as a result of lower oil and grain prices and the
transition to the reformed taxation system.
    The deficit is expected to total 28.9 billion dlrs in
fiscal 1989 and 28.6 billion dlrs in 1989 and then fall to 26.1
billion dlrs in 1991.
    Wilson was optimistic about the outlook for the Canadian
economy, forcasting gross domestic product would expand 2.8 pct
this year and 3.0 pct in 1988. In 1986 the economy grew by an
actual 3.1 pct.
    Inflation, meanwhile, is expected to stabilize at around
the current four pct level over the next two years.

Finance Minister Michael Wilson tabled a
ways and means motion to immediately impose a special tax on
preferred share dividends to eliminate a significant loss of
corporate tax revenue.
    Under the motion, which is used to introduce most financial
tax changes, dividends on all preferred shares issued after
June 18 will be taxable.
    The issuing corporation will be able to choose between two
forms of tax, one that imposes a 25 pct tax on dividends with a
subsequent additional 10 pct tax paid by the shareholder, and
one that imposes a flat 40 pct tax on dividends.
    "Measures to reduce the tax advantages of after-tax
financing arrangements using preferred shares are a critical
step in achieving the broadened corporate tax base required to
fund personal income tax reductions," Wilson explained.
    The minister said many profitable corporations, using
various deductions built up over the years, pay no taxes,
although they are in a position to pay dividends out of their
profits.

Finance Minister Michael Wilson unveiled
a wide-ranging reform of the personal tax system that includes
limiting the capital gains exemption and a sharp cut in the
dividend tax credit.
    With most changes effective at the first of next year,
Wilson also announced he was cutting the number of tax brackets
from 10 to three.
    He said the changes will cut personal tax revenues by two
billion dlrs in 1988 and by more than 11 billion dlrs over the
next five years.
    "Most Canadians will pay lower taxes because of two
far-reaching changes. A new structure of federal income tax
rates and the conversion of exemptions and deductions to tax
credits," Wilson told the House of Commons.
    The new tax brackets will be 17 pct on the first 27,500
dlrs of taxable income, 26 pct on the next 27,500 dlrs and 29
pct on taxable income in excess of 55,000 dlrs. The maximum tax
rate is 34 pct under the current system.
    In a major reversal of his own initiative, Wilson said the
controversial 500,000 dlrs capital gains exemption will be
reduced to 100,000 dlrs over an investors' lifetime.
    Wilson introduced the exemption shortly after taking office
in 1984 as a a way of stimulating investment, but it was
sharply criticized by the opposition as over-generous to
wealthy investors.
    The 500,000 dlr lifetime exemption  will be kept on the
sale of farm land and for small businesess, however.
    Also, the taxable portion of a capital gain will increase
from 50 pct currently to 66-2/3 pct in 1988 and 75 pct in 1990.
    The dividend tax credit will be reduced from 33-1/3 pct to
25 pct and the deduction for up to 1,000 dlrs of interest and
dividend income will be eliminated in 1988.
    Wilson said tax treatment for registered retirement savings
plan contributions will be maintained but the phase in of the
increase in the maximum limit to 15,500 dlrs will be delayed 
four years to 1994.

Faulty repairs and inadequate inspection
caused the 1985 crash of a Japan Airlines Co Ltd <JAPN.T> (JAL)
Boeing 747 which killed 520 people, the Japanese government
said in a final official report.
    The clear cause of the crash was faulty repair work by the
Boeing Co <BA>, said Shun Takeda, the ministry of transport
official leading the accident investigation committee.
    But the report also criticised the ministry's inspectors
for failing to carry out a full check of the repairs before
signing the clearance sheet.
    The aircraft hit Mount Osutaka, north of Tokyo, on August
12, 1985, after a bulkhead separating the pressurised cabin
from the unpressurised tail suddenly burst, fracturing key
navigation systems. Only four people survived.
    A Japan Air Lines spokesman declined comment on the report.
Boeing is expected to release a statement later today.
    The report cleared the JAL crew of all responsibility.
    In a separate set of recommendations, the investigators
said large aircraft operating in Japan should have fail-safe
systems, but did not say how this should be done.
    A press statement by a group of lawyers representing
victims of the crash criticised the report for not dealing in
greater depth with the fail-safe aspect.
    The lawyers said Boeing had showed it believed the crash
was due to design defects by specifying two design
modifications to prevent a recurrence in a memorandum filed in
King County, Washington, Superior Court last March 24.
    They said similar official recommendations for fail-safe
systems following two air disasters involving DC-10 aircraft,
near Paris in 1974 and at Chicago in 1979, had been rejected
after objections from aircraft manufacturers.
    The government investigators asked the ministry to
formulate concrete guidelines for its inspectors. An internal
ministry memo earlier this year complained that inspectors were
left too much on their own when making aircraft checks.
    A Boeing team made repairs to the aircraft's aft bulkhead
under JAL supervision, and Transport Ministry inspectors
approved the repairs without actually seeing them, today's
report said.
    The inspectors were unable to check Boeing's work because
the part repaired had been covered by a seal, the report said.
    Over time, cabin pressurisation speeded up the process of
metal fatigue in the repaired bulkhead.
    Boeing issued an official statement on September 6, 1985,
saying the 1978 repairs it had carried out were faulty. It did
not link them with the crash.

The Tokyo stock market will probably not
make significant gains next week and may suffer a temporary
correction, brokers said.
    Dashed hopes of a further cut in Japan's 2.5 pct discount
rate cut and a growing conviction the dollar will remain firm
against the yen in the near-term has created a measure of
uncertainty over the market's future, brokers said.
    "Everybody is just trying to think through things and see
exactly what is going on," said a broker at Sanyo Securities Co
Ltd. "There is a lot of confusion," he added.
    This uncertainty was spotlighted by violent swings in stock
prices over the last two days. Today the 225-share average
ended 462.43 points lower at 25,288.12.
    "People expect a correction next week. They don't care if
the market falls to 24,000," the Sanyo broker said. "There is
always enough money waiting to get into the market to fill any
correction."
    Tokyo stock prices owe a major part of their two-year bull
run to repeated cuts in the discount rate, which diverts money
from bank deposits to the stock market and cuts the cost of
borrowing, boosting domestic demand and imports.
    "Fund managers are restructuring their investment portfolios
to sell domestic-related issues and include a few more
exporters," said Prudential Bache Securities' Hank Sawa.
    Tokyo-based foreign exchange dealers predict the dollar is
unlikely to fall sharply in the near term, thus convincing
stock market investors to buy electronics, precision
instrument, machinery and some other export-oriented
manufacturing shares, brokers said.

protectionist U.S. Trade legislation in July for clues to the

Net receipts of U.K. Building societies
in May fell to 521 mln stg from 727 mln in April and compared
with 500 mln in May 1986, figures from the Building Societies
Association show.
    Association director-general Mark Boleat said in a
statement he was satisfied with the May figure in view of the
calls for investors funds' generated by the privatisation of
Rolls-Royce Plc and the approaching second call on the
partly-paid British Gas Plc shares.
    Boleat said the recently announced cut in mortgage rates
suggests a continuation of buoyant demand. He noted that
building society net receipts usually decline seasonally as
summer approaches.
    The British Gas second call fell on June 9, affecting
building society inflows in both May and June.
    Gross retail receipts in May, unadjusted for withdrawals,
were 7.46 billion stg against 6.63 mln in April and 5.60

Japanese oil companies are starting
campaigns to market 100 octane gasoline to meet growing
domestic demand for higher quality motor fuel, oil sources
said.
    Ten companies plan to offer the unleaded gasoline this
summer, starting with <Idemitsu Kosan Co Ltd> on June 20.
    Showa Shell Sekiyu KK <SHOL.T> introduced its Formula Shell
98 octane gasoline to the Japanese market in January this year.
    Formula Shell has achieved strong sales in Japan despite a
higher price than regular octane gasoline, which has prompted
other oil firms to offer a rival product, the sources said.
    "We have received a good response from consumers of Formula
Shell in terms of a smoother ride and effective fuel
consumption," Showa Shell said.
    Shell's product sells for 145 yen per litre, 15 yen higher
than regular gasoline, and has already achieved a 38 pct share
of Japan's high octane gasoline market, it said.
    High octane gasoline accounts for 25 pct of Shell's total
gasoline sales in Japan, it added.
    Idemitsu said it hopes to raise high octane sales to 20 pct
of its total gasoline sales from about seven pct, immediately
after the launch of its Idemitsu 100.
    Nippon Oil Co Ltd <NPOL.T> said it will launch its 100
octane gasoline on July 1, aiming for an increase in high
octane sales to 20 pct from six pct of its total gasoline
sales.
    The rush to compete for high octane gasoline market share
has been spurred by expectations that the government will lift
gasoline production quotas and restrictions on gasoline station
construction in the next two to three years.
    "Major oil companies are trying to boost their gasoline
sales network ahead of the proposed lifting of gasoline
production quotas," an official at a major oil company said.
    An advisory panel to the Ministry of International Trade
and Industry (MITI) recommended this week that the government
press ahead with deregulation of the oil industry, including
the lifting of gasoline production quotas, to help oil
companies increase their international competitiveness.
    Japan's three biggest gasoline marketers, Nippon Oil,
Idemitsu and Showa Shell, suffered supply shortages under the
production quota guideline in fiscal 1986, ended last March.
    Domestic gasoline demand during the year was up 2.5 pct
from the previous year, according to a MITI report.

French domestic appliance maker Moulinex
<MOUP.PA> shares continued to fall on the Paris Bourse reaching
its year's low amid controversy over an auditor's report on
1987 profit forecasts, dealers said.
    A Moulinex spokesman said a "mutilated" copy of the report by
Paris auditors Syndex, which gave a poor impression of the
company's prospects, had caused the stock to fall sharply.
    Meanwhile, Moulinex said in a communique that it stood by
its April forecast of a 1987 parent company net loss of 41.7
mln francs vs a 226 mln loss in 1986.

    The spokesman said 50 pages of the 200-page report,
commissioned by Moulinex's staff/management committee, had been
circulated to several Parisian stockbrokers.
    The Syndex report said the company's 1987 target would be
difficult to achieve, thereby causing Moulinex stock to drop
almost 13 francs in two days to 75.10 francs per share.
    A Syndex spokesman said yesterday that the auditors were
"shocked" by the leak of a confidential document and attributed
it to "malicious intentions." Several Paris brokers said it was
likely that corporate "raiders" interested in a takeover bid had
put out the Syndex report to bring down the share price.

    Moulinex shares have fluctuated considerably since the
beginning of the year on takeover rumours, reaching a high of
122 francs.
    Group president Jean Mantelet, who is 87, said in February
that he intended to transfer his 42 pct stake in Moulinex to

options.

Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson
said current low unit wage costs are helping British exports
but wage rises are "faster than is comfortable."
    He hoped yesterday's Organisation for Economic Cooperation
and Development (OECD) forecasts of increases in wage rises
were wrong, saying OECD predictions "are somewhat unreliable."
    "Productivity is rising very fast, and therefore even though
wages are going up faster than is comfortable, the actual unit
cost of labour...Is not going up fast at all," Lawson said in
answer to questions on BBC radio.
    "That is one of the reasons why we're doing so well in
export markets, for example, but we could do even better and
get unemployment down even faster if there was a more moderate
rate of growth in wage increases," Lawson added.
    His remarks followed yesterday's news that underlying
average earnings were rising 7.75 pct annually in April, up
from March's 7.5 pct increase, which sent the U.K. Government
bond market lower and helped trigger inflation worries.
    Lawson said he would not update his own economic forecasts
for the U.K. Until the traditional Autumn Statement on the
economy.
    Lawson would not be drawn on whether he will cut the basic
rate of tax from the current 27 pct to 25 pct in the next
budget due in March 1988.
    "We will certainly achieve it sooner or later," he said.
    The latest official data, released yesterday, showed unit
wage costs in manufacturing industry were rising 0.9 pct
annually in the three month period ended April, down from a 1.2
pct rise in the first quarter and sharply below last year's
first quarter growth rate of 7.8 pct.
    However, analysts said this figure is likely to deteriorate
somewhat as productivity growth slows later this year.

Canada Post presented its striking

    The strike has been especially bitter in Quebec, where the
federally regulated postal service has brought in replacement
workers in contravention of provincial laws that prohibit
hiring strikebreakers.
    Canada Post said letter carriers in Chicoutimi and

telephone lines and letter racks, overturned furniture and
threw mail on the floor before walking out to join carriers in
other cities on the picket line.
    The rotating strike spread today to the Atlantic provinces

Vancouver while postal employees went back to work in Montreal,

An organization of Tennessee
Valley Authority industrial customers said it has joined the
TVA in asking a court to prevent the U.S. Department of Energy
from witholding contracted payments to TVA.
    The Tennessee Valley Industrial Committee said it is
seeking permission to intervene in TVA's federal district court
lawsuit requesting DOE be enjoined from witholding payments due
under "minimum demand" provisions of the TVA's contract to
supply electricity to uranium enrichment facilities at Oak
Ridge, Tenn., and Paducah, Ky.
   
    Such provisions obligate TVA to make available a certain
amount of power and the customer -- in this case the DOE --
agrees to pay the fixed costs associated with that amount of
power whether is is used or not.
    The committee represents 27 large, energy-intensive
industries with operations in the TVA service area. These
industries, like DOE, are served directly by TVA as opposed to
going through a local distributors.
    The TVA has said DOE's intention, announced last week, to
withhold increasing percentages of its electric bill will
result in a revenue shortfall of about 250 mln dlrs and force
an about six pct rate increase to all other customers.

argue that interest rates are still too high and deter
investment in industry.
    "But we should not forget that less than a year ago we were
intervening to support sterling and had some temporary
difficulty in persuading the markets that a one pct increase in
base rates, to 11 pct, was a sufficient tightening of policy at
the time," he added. Base rate is currently nine pct.

More U.K. Lenders are offering homebuyers
fixed interest rate mortgages under which the borrower makes
the same monthly payment no matter what happens to other
interest rates.
    And with mortgage rates now at their lowest levels in
years, the loans have been snapped up by eager home buyers
trying to lock into cheap money.
    The decision to offer fixed rate loans, industry officials
said, reflects the increasingly competitive nature of the home
mortgage business.
    While fixed rate mortgages are uncommon in the U.K., They
were the mainstay of the business in the U.S. Up until only a
few years ago.
    But in the early 1980s interest rates soared. U.S. Lenders,
mostly savings and loan associations, were earning rates as low
as three pct on 30 year fixed rate mortgages they held in their
portfolios but had to pay depositors rates as high as 15 pct to
induce them to retain their accounts.
    As a result hundreds of institutions collapsed or were
forced to merge. The survivors decided to offer mortgages whose
rates would move in line with the cost of funds.
    "We very much have the example of the U.S. Thrifts in mind,"
said a spokesman for Abbey National Building Society,
explaining why his institution, for the time being, is only
offering variable rate mortgages.
    The rash of advertising to solicit new business has helped
homebuyers to become even choosier about loans and lenders
concede they are being forced to undercut each other still
more.
    Sharp cuts on variable rate mortgages announced earlier
this week by the nation's two largest building societies and by
National Westminster Bank Plc reflect growing competition for
new business, officials at all three institutions said.
    The fixed rate mortgages on offer carry interest rates even
below those on the variable rate loans.
    "Of course they are less profitable than other (variable
rate) mortgages," said a spokesman for Midland Bank Plc, which
earlier this year said it earmarked 500 mln dlrs for fixed rate
new mortgage loans.
    But he said the bank is willing to offer less profitable
loans because, "It was just another way to attract people to our
mortgage product."
    Trustee Savings Bank Plc (TSB) was offering five year fixed
rate mortgages at 9.9 pct earlier this year.
    The 100 mln stg that TSB set aside for the loans was
exhausted within just a few days, according to a spokeswoman.
    "Everybody loves an under 10 pct mortgage," she said, noting
that within five days the bank loaned the equivalent of 25 pct
of its 1986 volume.
    In short, the appeal of fixed rate mortgages is that they
offer an opportunity to gamble on the direction of interest
rates. If interest rates fall after the mortgage is made the
lender is earning an above average return on assets.
    But if interest rates rise it is the homebuyer who has won
the benefit of cheap money.
    Household Mortgage Co had planned to offer a 25 year fixed
rate mortgage after the June 11 elections on the assumption
that a Conservative Party victory would help money market rates
fall further, according to Duncan Young, managing director.
    Young explained that the company had planned to protect
itself against the chance of rising interest rates by buying a
complicated hedging instrument.
    But money market rates have risen contrary to expectations
and the company has shelved its plans for the time being. He
said money market rates were too high to arrange both the
mortgages and hedge profitably.
    However, he said that when the Household Mortgage Co does
make fixed rate mortgages it is likely to securitise them. This
means bundling different mortgages together to resemble a bond
and selling them to an investor.
    For technical reasons securitisation is simpler and more
efficient with fixed rate rather than with floating rate
mortgages. In the U.S., Where fixed rate mortgages are popular
again, securitisation has provided the bulk of mortgage money
over the past few years.

Standard and Poor's Corp said it
withdrew the ratings on Caesars World Inc and unit Caesars
World Finance Corp.
    The action affects 230.8 mln dlrs of debt.
    Withdrawn were Caesars World's BB senior debt and B-plus
subordinated debt and the unit's B-plus subordinated debt.
    S and P said these issues are expected to be refinanced
when Caesars World implements a recapitalization plan. The
agency assigned a B-plus rating to Caesars World's proposed 330
mln dlr issue of seven-year senior notes and a B-minus grade to
its 330 mln dlrs of subordinated debentures due 1999.
    Standard and Poor's noted that the recapitalization plan of
Caesars World calls for the payment of a 26.25 dlr per share
dividend totaling 929.3 mln dlrs.
    The recapitalization plan will be financed by the
seven-year note and 12-year debenture issues, 300 mln dlrs in
bank and other debt, and by cash on hand, S and P noted.
    The agency said that Caesars World's debt will rise to 1.1
billion dlrs from about 319.2 mln on April 30 and the firm will
have stockholders' deficit of 508.8 mln dlrs. S and P said it
does not expect a meaningful reduction of debt for the next

GTE Corp scientists said they
have discoverd a much simpler method for producing transistors
by creating an entirely new electronic material.
    The new method, they said, consists of simultaneously
"growing" metal connections and silicon crystals together to
form one, three dimensional device with connections penetrating
the entire device.
    Conventional transistors require many steps to make and
have connections only on the surface.
    GTE Laboratories created "an entirely new electronic
material and device form, which may open up a spectrum of uses
that cannot even be imagined at this time," said David Decker,
vice president and director of research for GTE Laboratories.
    "Although still early in our research, we are obviously
excited that we have found a significantly simpler and, we
believe, cheaper way to produce an electronic device," he said.
    Researchers at GTE created the new transistor by combining
and heating silicon and a conductive metal, tantalum
disilicide, so that the two grow together.
    The resulting device has microscopic metal rods extending
througout the chips, creating a three dimensional transistor
that should be superior to standard devics in high power
applications, the scientists said.
    They said that, because the connections extend vertically
througout the new device, it has a much greater volume of
active material than conventional surface-mounted connections.
    Decker said the scientists are still in the early stages of
their research on the device, but prototypes of the new device
compare favorably with conventionaly made transistors and show
promise of superior performance.
    He said the prototype device also proved to be particularly
efficient in detecting light, which could open up new
possibilities in solar energy conversion, the development of
electronic cameras and greater efficiency in optical
communication systems.

Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc officials
were not available for comment on market rumors that it is
interested in acquiring Reed International plc <REED.L>.
    Officials of First Boston Inc, Harcourt's financial
adviser, declined comment.
    A Wall Street arbitrageur, who owns Harcourt shares, said
the rumors did not make much sense because Harcourt has
announced a recapitalization plan to ward off a takeover
attempt by British publisher Robert Maxwell."It's completely
inconsistent with the recapitalization, the only way is if they
drop the recapitalization," he said.
    Calls to Harcourt seeking comment were not returned.
    Harcourt's recapitalization will come under scrutiny of a
U.S. Court in Orlando, Fla. Monday. The company has sought a
declaratory judgment on convertibility of debentures due 2011
in light of the recapitalization.
    Harcourt said in a statement this week that Salomon
Brothers Inc <SB> and Mutual Shares Corp have intervened in the
case, claiming ownership of more than 30 mln dlrs face amount
of the debenture. In addition, British Printing and
Communications Corp, headed by Maxwell, owns 9.5 mln dlrs face
amount, Harcourt said.
    Salomon said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission today that it has 21,978 of the debentures. If the
court decides they should be converted at par value of one dlr,
they could be converted into 22.0 mln shares.
    Harcourt is asking the court to rule the company is not
required to issue common to debenture holders who did not
convert prior to June eight.
    An increase in Reed shares in London today was attributed
by brokers to rumors of Harcourt's interest and also to rumors
that Maxwell might be a buyer. But an adviser to Maxwell in New
York said "there's no basis to think that it's us."

Salomon Brothers Inc said it has
acquired 21,978 convertible subordinated debentures of Harcourt
Brace Jovanovich Inc, which it says could be converted into
21,978,000 common shares.
    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
the New York brokerage firm said it bought the debentures,
which have a face value of 1,000 dlrs each, in May and June as
a regular part of its investment and arbitrage activities.
    The conversion rights of the debentures are the subject of
a Florida court case, in which Salomon Brothers said it has
also intervened.
    Salomon Brothers said it rejects Hartcourt's position that
the debentures are not convertible into stock as of June 9.
    It said it would leave open a range of options regarding
the debentures, including buying more, selling some or all of
their current stake in the market or in negotiated deals,
talking with other Harcourt security holders, surrendering the
debentures if there were a merger or tender offer or converting
them into stock.
    Salomon said it would have a 35.8 pct stake in Harcourt,
based on 39.4 mln shares outstanding, if it converted the
debentures into 21,978,000 common shares. The percentage is
based on the current outstanding plus the amount of stock that
would be issued in a conversion.
    But Salomon said its stake in Harcourt's common stock would
be lower if other debentureholders converted their securities
into stock. It says it has no idea of the total number of
debentures outstanding.
    Harcourt has said that Salomon and Mutual Shares Corp, a
New York investment firm, hold a combined total of 30 mln dlrs
of debentures.
    Harcourt announced a recapitalization plan last month to
ward off a takeover attempt by British publisher Robert
Maxwell.

representing interests in a pool of receivables selected from
its California Classic Visa credit card accounts.
    The certificate rate is 8.2 pct. The offering price to the
public is 99.89 dlrs, resulting in a yield to certificate
holdes of 8.21 pct.
    The certificates have a provisional rating of Aaa by
Moody's Investors Service and are backed by a 30-mln-dlr
lettter of credit by Bayerische Vereinsbank AG, BankAmerica
said.
    The offering will be co-managed by Salomon Brothers Inc and
the bank.
    "Selling these loans provides a cost-effective source of
medium-term funds and allows the bank to leverage its existing
capital base across a broad range of activities," said Vice
Chairman and Chief Financial Officer Frank Newman.
    Bank of America said it will continue to service the loans
and maintain customer relationships, while the proceeds of the
offering can be used to fund new loans.
    BankAmerica said it pioneered securitization in 1977 with
home loans sold as mortgage pass-through certificates.

The tug-of-war over who pays to develop
new weapons--contractors or the government--is likely to lead
to more writeoffs by defense firms, analysts said.
    Singer Co <SMF> and Northrop Corp <NOC> recently announced
planned second quarter writeoffs related to costs of major
defense programs under fixed-price government contracts.
    "It's a case of companies paying for things that in a
different environment the Defense Department would have paid
for," said Howard Mager of Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette Securities
Corp.
    In recent years, the Defense Department, DOD, has increased
competitive bidding for weapons contracts and has asked
contractors to pay more of the costs of developing weapons
programs.
    The moves have helped cut waste and abuse by contractors
but have also dictated that the firms assume much more risk,
analysts said.
    "It's a stricter environment," said Anthony Hatch of Argus
Research Corp. "Contractors are absorbing more of the cost and
more of risk and that's likely to be the trend for some time to
come."
    The trend will probably lead to further writeoffs, the
analysts said. Programs most prone, they agreed, are the
Advanced Tactical Fighter, ATF, a new generation,
high-technology fighter plane being developed for the U.S. Air
Force, the C-17 air transport plane and the Light Helicopter
Experimental, LHX, under development for the Army.
    Other programs may also be affected, they said.
    The Air Force is expected to order 750 of the advanced
fighter planes in the 1990s at a cost of up to 40 billion dlrs,
analysts have said. Two teams of contractors are competing for
a contract to develop a prototype ATF.
    Lockheed Corp <LK>, General Dynamics Corp <GD> and Boeing
Co <BA> are teamed in competition against Northrop Corp <NOC>
and McDonnell Douglas Corp <MD> on ATF.
    The two teams fighting for an award to develop the LHX are
Bell Helicopter, a unit of Textron Inc <TXT>, coupled with
McDonnell Douglas, and United Technologies Corp's <UTX>
Sikorsky paired with Boeing.
    The C-17 is a four-engine transport plane. McDonnell
Douglas's Douglas Aircraft Co is working on two test planes,
and a production award for up to 210 of the aircraft should be
made by late 1989, a Douglas Aircraft spokesman said.
    Under the government's new procedures, contractors can
spend hundreds of millions of dollars on development and  
typically recoup their investments during production.
    But now the government sometimes awards production to a
second contractor who did not develop the system. General
Electric Co <GE>, for example, developed the F404 engine for
the Navy. But two weeks ago, the Pentagon awarded 30 pct of
F404 production to United Technologies' Pratt and Whitney.
    Such tactics have increased competition but the government
now risks decimating the industry by making it too competitive,
said Michael LaTronica of Redding Research Group.
    "Two years ago, defense contractors were their own worst
enemies. They were not cost efficient," LaTronica said. "Now
DOD has allowed the situation to swing so far back the other
way that you may be in danger of losing the defense industry as
a national resource."
    While the nation as a whole has posted trade deficits in
recent years, aerospace and defense has exported more products
than it imported, he noted.
    LaTronica and others said, however, that changes in
government procurement may be coming.
    "I hear that the Pentagon is looking into the situation,"
said John Diamantis, defense analyst at Pershing and Co.
    He said that some small defense electronics firms believe
the Pentagon will begin re-evaluating procurement policy and
perhaps start paying more development money.
    Redding Research's LaTronica, who still likes the industry
despite the probability of additional unforeseen writeoffs,
said, "There's been a swing in sentiment. The defense bashing
psychology of the last few years is starting to shift."
    LaTronica noted that one government official has recently
suggested that the winner of the ATF prototype award should get
sole production of the plane for a specified time.
    The investments are large. The Lockheed, General Dynamics,
Boeing ATF team, for example, is spending 691 mln dlrs just to
develop the prototype.
    The danger the Pentagon runs if changes are not made is
that companies will hesitate to bid to develop a program but
instead will wait for a second source production award.
    "But it may take a company going bust to really change
people's thinking," LaTronica said.

Unocal Corp said it told the U.S.
Treasury Department that it will not include fluidized bed
combustion technology, a method for the more efficient burning

due to high costs.
    Under a 1985 agreement with the now-defunct U.S. Synthetic
Fuels Corp, Unocal said it would study using the technology at
the oil shale plant. In return the company would have been
eligible for 500 mln dlrs in loan gaurantees and price supports
from the U.S. Treasury Department, which took over the contract
from the Synthetic Fuels Corp, Unocal said.
    Unocal said its studies showed the cost for the fluidized
bed combustion facility would have exceeded 352 mln dlrs,
compared with an original estimate of 260 mln dlrs.
    The fluidized bed facility would have provided heat and
electricity for the oil shale project, Unocal said.
    Last year's fall in oil prices and the loss of investment
tax credit under the Tax Reform Act made the project
uneconomical even with government price supports and loan
guarantees, Unocal said.
    The Parachute Creek oil shale plant produces about 4,000 to
5,000 barrels per day of crude shale oil, Unocal said.

Merck Co <MRK> and Squibb Corp <SQB>
will benefit from a study that shows lower levels of blood
cholesterol slows the build-up of fat in the heart's arteries,
lowering the risk of heart attacks, industry analysts said.
    Both companies have developed drugs that slow the body's
production of cholesterol although Merck is about 18 months
ahead of Squibb with a drug expected to be approved this year.
    "Certainly this study will create greater acceptance of
anti-cholesterol drugs," said Robert Uhl, a drug analyst at F.
Eberstadt Fleming.
    Although neither company's drug was used in the study,
which was conducted by a team of scientists at the University
of Southern California School of Medicine, both are leaders in
a new class of drugs that fight cholesterol.
    The study, reported in the Journal of the American Medical
Association, showed lower levels of cholesterol, achieved
through a combination of drugs and special diet, slowed and in
some cases reversed the build up of fatty deposits in the
heart's arteries.
    Such build up leads to heart attacks, the leading cause of
death in the U.S.
    Health officials have said lower levels of cholesterol
could immediately benefit six mln Americans who suffer symptoms
of coronary artery disease. The study advocated reduction of
cholesterol in some 40 mln Americans.
    As the anti-cholesterol crusade gains momentum, industry
analysts and executives believe a healthier diet and drug
therapy will gain wider acceptance.
    In this context, pharmaceutical analyst David Crossen of
Sanford C. Bernstein said "the culture can shift in terms of
drug treatment because some people arn't going to fundamentally
alter their diets".
    The worldwide anti-cholesterol drug market is valued at 600
mln dlrs a year. But as the new drugs reach the market,
analysts estimate revenues will swell to 1.5 billion dlrs
annually in about next five years.
    The drugs used in the study, in combination with the low
cholesterol diet, were niacin, a common compound, and
colestipol, a drug Upjohn Co <UPJ> has sold since 1977.
    But these two drugs have some drawbacks that analysts say
the new drugs from Merck and Squibb avoid. "Niacin leads to
tremendous amounts of flushing, constipation, or stomach
upset," Crossen said.
    Colestipol, a sand-like powder, comes in a dosage of 15 to
30 grams and must be mixed with a glass of water. "It isn't fun
to take," Crossen said. Drug analyst Uhl said the drawbacks
restricted Upjohn's sales for the drug, which he said is under
10 mln dlrs a year.
    In contrast, the new drugs from Merck and Squibb have
little side effects because they target a key factor in the
body's production of cholesterol -- an enzyme found in the
liver.
   
    "Past methods of getting down cholesterol have been rather
variable," said Dr. Charles Sanders, an executive vice
president at Squibb. The new drugs, in contrast, interupt a
clear step in cholesterol production, Sanders said.
    Also, the new drugs are easier to take since they come in a
tablet form swallowed once or twice a day.
    Merck's drug, Mevacor, received a recommendation from an
advisory panel of the Food and Drug Administration earlier this
year and is expected to receive full approval for sale in late
summer or fall.
    Squibb's drug, eptastatin, is expected to be submitted for
regulatory approval in the first or second quarter 1988,
Sanders said.
    Warner Lambert Co <WLA> and Bristol Meyers Co <BMY> also
have cholesterol fighting compounds similar to the Upjohn drug,
but only Merck and Upjohn are ahead in the new class of
cholesterol inhibitors.

Lloyds Bank Plc's <LLOY.L> decision to
withdraw from making markets in Eurobonds and U.K. Government
bonds (gilts) sent shivers down the spines of other market
participants but was viewed as prudent by banking analysts.
    "It (the move) really isn't a surprise. They lost a lot of
money in the early stages of the gilt market and now they want
to cut their losses while they can," said Keith Brown, banking
analyst at Greenwell Montagu.
    "The question now is how many other gilt market makers will
face a similar fate," one senior gilt market maker said.
    Eurobond market participants were equally stunned. "They are
the first firm of that size I can remember to have pulled out
of eurobond market making altogether," said a member of the
Association of International Bond Dealers London staff.
    Other Eurobond market participants said that while Lloyds
had frequently changed the staff of some of its eurobond
operations, it was hard to believe they were in trouble.
    With this action Lloyds, the third largest U.K. clearing
bank, becomes the first U.K. clearing bank to withdraw from the
gilt market following the Big Bang deregulation of the London
Stock Exchange in October.

markets and we have decided to reallocate the resources to
opportunities which promise a better return on our shareholders

The Securities and Exchange
Commission said it supported legislation to define insider
trading and would recommend language for such a definition
within six weeks.
    Acting SEC chairman Charles Cox told the Senate Banking
Committee a bill proposed this week to define insider trading
as the wrongful use of material nonpublic information was good
but contained some ambiguous provisions which might reduce the
Commission's flexibility in prosecuting cases.
    "The Commission believes a definition of insider trading is
desirable," Cox said.
   
    He promised to provide the SEC's recommended definition to
the committee by August 3.
    The bill proposed by Sens. Donald Riegle, a Michigan
Democrat, and Alfonse D'Amato, a New York Republican, would
make it illegal for anyone to receive or pass on inside
information even if the person providing the information did
not use it to make a securities transaction.
    Federal law enforcement officials have said a definition of
insider trading would be useful because it is a difficult crime
to prove.
   
    Cox said the SEC was having success in its insider trading
cases despite the lack of a clear definition.
    He became acting chairman of the agency when chairman John
Shad left to become U.S. Ambassador to the Netherlands.
    President Reagan nominated Northwestern University law
professor David Ruder as SEC chairman on Wednesday, but he may
not be confirmed by the Senate for several weeks.
   
    Riegle, the chairman of the Senate securities subcommittee,
said he wanted to act on the legislation this year, but Thomas
Moore, a member of the President's Council of Economic
Advisors, said action should be delayed until the Supreme Court
ruled on the appearl of an insider trading conviction by former
Wall Street Journal reporter R. Foster Winans.
    Winans was convicted for telling a friend in advance what
stocks he was going to write about in his column. The stocks
usually went up or down in price depending on Winans'
recommendation.
   
    "We believe it would be better to wait until the Supreme
Court has reviewed the Winans case before any leigilation is
considered. After the court decides this case we can better
consider how the law might be changed. Until that time,
legislation is premature," Moore said in his testimony.

Reed International Plc <REED.L> denied
rumours on the U.K. Stock market that it was the target of a
takeover bid and said it had received no approach.
    "In view of the increase in our share price today, I want to
make clear that we have not received any bid approaches," Reed's
chairman Leslie Carpenter said in a statement.
    Rumours that U.S. Publisher Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc
<HBJ> might bid for Reed, a paper and printing company, pushed
Reed shares up 54p at 600p at one stage today before they eased
back to 564p at the close against a background of a widespread
decline in U.K. Equity prices.
    Share market analysts said speculators were buying the
stock on belief that Harcourt would bid for Reed in an effort
to escape the unwelcome two billion dlr bid from Robert
Maxwell's British Printing and Communication Corp <BPCL.L>.
    Such a move would have made Harcourt too big for BPCC to
take it over, analysts added.
    They also said there was some speculation that if BPCC's
bid for Harcourt was unsuccessful, it could turn its attention
to Reed.

U.S. Comptroller of the Currency
Robert Clarke said his office is expanding a plan giving
temporarily ailing but well managed national banks extra time
to come into compliance with its minimum capital requirements.
    The policy, which originally was intended to give well run
banks in economically depressed areas more time to rebuild
depleted capital levels, will be broadened to apply to all
national banks, Clarke said in a speech to a financial seminar.
A text of his remarks was made public today.
    The comptroller's office will extend the application
deadline for the plan to Dec. 31, 1989 from Dec. 31, 1987.
    It will extend to 1995 from 1993 the deadline for banks to
boost their capital levels to the required minimum level.
    Finally, it will eliminate a current requirement that a
bank have capital of at least four pct to participate in the
capital forbearance plan.
    "In theory, a bank could be allowed to continue to operate
with nearly zero capital if we approve its plan to rebuild its
capital base," Clarke said, though he added that a bank in that
situation would have a have "a virtually ironclad plan for a
prompt restoration of capital" to be accepted.
    The critical linkage to forbearance is that the
fundamentals must be in place to assure that the bank can
survive: in short, capable management and financial prospects,"
Clarke said.
    He said the program will continue to be closed to insolvent
banks.

After battling President Reagan all
year, Congress is about to pass a trillion dollar 1988 budget
that sets the stage for even fiercer fighting over its tax and

    But when the dust settles, congressional budget analysts
say, Reagan and the Democratic opposition may finally sit down
at a "budget summit" to call a truce and work out a deal over
implementing the budget he opposes.
    "I think he essentially will (negotiate)," said a prominent
House leader who did not want to be identified. "The ball is in
his court ... We've done everything we could to make a summit."
The Democrat budget plan calls for $19 billion in new taxes
next year, $64 billion over three years, and is set to be
passed by the Democratic-led Congress next week. It would cut
next year's deficit by about $37 billion to $134 billion.
    On Tuesday last week, Reagan said he would consider talks,
except on defence or taxes, but three days later argued that
Congress would first have to bend even further.

Chrysler Corp is taking a small step
away from automobiles and towards military contracting with the
purchase of Electrospace Systems Inc <ELE>, analysts said.
    "A chief goal of Chrysler is to gain military business for
their Gulfstream planes and this should help that cause
dramatically," said analyst Gary Glaser at First Boston Corp.
    Chrysler, which bought Gulfstream Aerospace Corp in 1985,
earlier said Electrospace agreed to be acquired in a friendly
merger for about 367 mln dlrs.
    Analysts said the merger continues a trend in the
automobile industry of diversification away from carmaking.
    General Motors Corp <GM> paid about five billion dlrs for
Hughes Aircraft, an aerospace company, in 1985. A year earlier
it bought Electronic Data Systems, a data processing firm, for
about 2.5 billion dlrs.
    Meanwhile, Ford Motor Co <F> has added First Nationwide
Savings as part of a move into financial services.
    Ford, which has a huge stockpile of cash, has indicated its
interest in aerospace with Lockheed Corp <LK> once rumored as a
possible target.
    Both Ford and Lockheed have denied the rumors, according to
analysts. Ford has about 9.5 billion dlrs of cash and
securities on hand, one analyst said.
    "The overall strategic thrust (within the car industry)
is to become somewhat less sensitive to the vagaries of the
automobile sales cycle," said analyst Jack Kirnan at Kidder
Peabody and Co. "One way companies feel they can do it,
particularly GM and Chrysler, is by diversifying into
aerospace," Kirnan said. Ford has been "a little bit of a
laggard" in that area, he said, which has been a concern to
some investors.
    Chrysler's first big move away from autos came in 1985,
when it purchased Gulfstream for 637 mln dlrs.
    Defense analysts said Chrysler was paying a high price for
Electrospace but auto analysts regarded it as a modest outlay
for the company. Electrospace earned 10 mln dlrs on sales of
191 mln dlrs in fiscal 1987 ended April 3.
    Kirnan said Chrysler may have some trouble digesting the
Richardson, Texas, electronics firm because it is also buying
American Motors Corp <AMC> for about two billion dlrs in a deal
set to close later this year.
    "Chrysler will have their hands full absorbing AMC for a
year or more and will absorb a lot of debt," Kirnan said,
making them the most heavily leveraged auto company.
    But other analysts said the relative small size of
Electrospace will make it easy for Chrysler to absorb.
    Analysts also noted that Hughes has contributed
significantly to GM and that Gulfstream provided about 57 mln
dlrs in pretax earnings to Chrysler last year.
    In a statement, Chrysler said 92 pct of Electrospace's
sales were to the military.
    In addition to helping Gulfstream gain government business,
Chrysler said it believes electronics technology will help the
automobile business.
    Robert Miller Jr, Chrysler Corp vice chairman, said that
Gulfstream's business, for example, involves electronics,
composites and aerodynamic design. "Those will all be important
technologies for winning in the automobile business in the
1990s," Miller told

President Reagan's nominee as top
policeman for the nation's securities markets will inherit an
agency challenged by an insider trading scandal, wild stock
price gyrations and a host of uncertainties stemming from the
globalization of financial markets.
    David Ruder, a 58-year-old Republican law professor at
Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., was named Thursday
to be the 23rd chairman of the five-member U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission.
    If confirmed by the Senate, as expected, he will succeed
John Shad, who left the agency earlier this week after a record
six years as chairman to become ambassador to the Netherlands.
    The SEC has been in the limelight for the past year as its
investigators have probed into the most colossal insider
trading scandal ever uncovered on Wall Street.
    The investigation, which is still active, mushroomed in
recent months as a growing number of well known traders and
prominent investment banking firms have been charged with
wrongdoing.
    The pace of the probe picked up markedly in November after
Ivan Boesky, one of Wall Street's most successful stock
speculators, agreed to cooperate with government investigators
and to pay a record 100 mln dlrs in penalties and illegal
profits after being charged with insider trading.
    But the agency is also wrestling with a vexing new
phenomenon of huge and rapid swings in stock prices, spurred by
computer-driven trading strategies that span markets in 
securities, options and futures. The price gyrations have
combined with rising trading volumes to bring unprecedented
volatility to some U.S. securities markets.
    At the same time, the SEC is being pressed by some
lawmakers to put a stop to abusive tactics in corporate
takeover contests as an unrelenting wave of such takeovers
steadily reshapes the U.S. corporate landscape.
    And the agency is being pushed by U.S. and foreign
exchanges intent on expansion to lay the regulatory groundwork
for an international securities marketplace in which trading
occurs across borders throughout the world, around the clock.
    Such worldwide trading networks offer vast new investment
opportunities but could strain the SEC's ability to enforce
U.S. securities laws and guard investors from fraud.
    Under the leadership of Shad, the SEC eased financial
disclosure requirements for publicly traded companies,
eliminated many minor investor protection rules, attempted to
spur competition among exchanges and streamlined the agency's
review of hostile corporate takeovers.
    Shad, who had been vice chairman of the E. F. Hutton
investment banking firm, brought a Wall Street perspective to
the agency upon being named chairman in 1981.
    In line with the views of other top administration
officials, he favored marketplace determination of takeover
battles over new federal regulations.
    The SEC under Shad also stressed prosecution of insider
trading violations over the corporate wrongdoing cases that
topped the agency's enforcement agenda during the
administration of President Jimmy Carter, a Democrat.
    Securities lawyers and industry officials acquainted with
Ruder say the new chairman-designate is unlikely to
significantly alter the commission's current priorities.
    The SEC currently has about 2,000 employees, most of them
lawyers, and an annual budget of about 115 mln dlrs though that
figure likely will be significantly higher next year as the
agency moves to beef up its enforcement staff.
    The agency is one of the few in the government that
actually has taken in more money than it has spent in the past
few years because of fees it charges public companies,
investment banks and other securities firms it regulates.
    The SEC is structured as an independent regulatory agency,
meaning that its five commissioners are appointed by the
president to fixed five-year terms and protected from firing
for policy differences alone.
    By law, no more than three commissioners may be of the same
political party, and the agency prepares its own budget request
each year instead of leaving this to the White House.
    Established by Congress in 1934, the SEC traces its origins
to the great stock market crash of 1929, which was attributed
in large part to widespread trading on credit and attempted
market manipulations by large investment firms.

The Administration asked Congress to
replace the U.S. tariff schedule with a new system to bring it
into line with international tariff categories, U.S. Trade
Representative Clayton Yeutter said.
    The new system will add such items as fiber optics and more
accurately define new composites, items not widely traded when
the current schedule was devised some 30 years ago.
    Yeutter said the Harmonized System, as the new schedule is
called, will change tariff categories and definitions to meet
the present-day needs of exporters and importers, but they
should pay about the same rates of duties.
    Yeutter said, "American exporters will find it far easier to
deal with one standardized worldwide system than the variety of
differing systems which they now face."
    He said the new system ended 12 years of multinational
negotiations to create the unified tariff schedule.
    Yeutter said government and business moves are based on
data from tariff schedules and the new system will improve
knowledge of trade flows and the quality of decision-making.
    He said 56 nations pledged to bring their standards under
the new system, with about half expected to join the system by
January 1988.

Tenneco Inc said Tennessee Gas Pipeline
Co, its largest interstate natural gas pipeline, will transport
natural gas under the open access rules of the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission, FERC.
    In open access, gas pipelines serve purely as a transport
company, moving gas from suppliers to customers. Pipelines also
transport its own gas to customers.
    Earlier this week, Transco Energy Co <T> rejected the FERC
guidelines, saying it would not offer open access until the
regulatory body offers a solution to the exposure it faces for
gas it has bought but could not sell.
    The exposure faced by the industry stems from take or pay
contracts, under which pipelines bought gas on long-term
contracts they could not sell. The problem grew severe as
customers won cheaper sources of gas because of open access.
    Some industry analysts speculated earlier this week that
Tenneco might follow Transco's lead and close its pipelines to
open-access because of the take-or-pay issue.
    But Tenneco today said open access "is one of the steps
FERC is taking to restructure the gas industry in the U.S. FERC
is moving the industry through this restructuring now, even
before all transitional problems are solved."
    A spokesman said Tenneco faces 1.7 billion dlrs in exposure
under the take-or-pay contracts, but he had no specific figure
for Tennessee Gas, which runs 2,000 miles of pipelines from
Louisiana and Texas up to New England.
    "We remain convinced that the most critical transitional
issue facing the industry--take-or-pay--must be resolved by
FERC in the near future.
    "A failure to do so could have grave consequences for the
industry's continued ability to provide its customers with
reliable natural gas," said Tennessee Gas Transmission Co
president R.C. Thomas.

The economy faces lackluster growth
and the risk of recession this year if the recent improvement
in U.S. exports should falter, economists say.
    Growth will slow sharply in the next months due to weakness

The Food and Drug Administration said
stepped up testing of condoms by the agency has led to a three
recalls by U.S. manufacturers and the detention of foreign-made
condoms at U.S. borders.
    The FDA said industry standards require that roughly no
more than four out of 1,000 condoms leak. Condoms are tested by
pouring 10 ounces of water in each and looking for leakage.
    The FDA said Schmid Laboratories of Little Falls, N.J., has
voluntarily recalled one lot of Sheik Fetherlite condoms, which
was distributed to 22 accounts through the United States.
   
    The agency said Schmid reported that almost all of the
condoms were still in transit or at wholesalers at the time of
the recall and are being recovered.
    National Sanitary Labs of Lincolnwood, Ill, voluntarily
recalled a lot of Protex Contracept Plus brand latex condoms
which were distributed to a wholesaler in California and two
retailers in Indiana and Michigan, the FDA said.

lot remains on the market. The FDA also said National recalled

The six basis point rise of the past
month in U.S. debt futures may be extended next week by a
series of U.S. economic reports, analysts said, as long as the
dollar holds firm.
    "Interest rates have declined by approximately 50 basis
points over the last month, largely over indications that
inflation is not as high as people had feared and the narrowing
U.S. trade balance, in nominal terms," Samuel Kahan, chief
financial economist with Kleinwort Benson Government
Securities, said.
    Kahan said recent government reports have shown strength in
the economy during the first quarter, but his concern is
whether the U.S. economy will sustain that strength in the
longer term.
    Weak U.S. economic growth could hurt the dollar, which has
become more important to the direction of debt futures than the
beneficial impact on interest rates of a sluggish economy.
    The median trade expectations for Tuesday's U.S. Consumer
Price Index and Durable Goods reports are up 0.4 pct and down
1.5 pct, respectively.
    Meanwhile, the eight billion dlr drop in the M-1 money
supply announced this week was "surprising, much larger than
expected," according to Kahan. "Unless quickly reversed," such
a trend "will ensure that June M-1 growth will be negative,"
Kahan said.
    Taken in conjunction with M-2 and M-3 aggregates which
Kahan said have "slowed to a crawl, below Federal Reserve Board
annual targets," the consequences could be a hint of economic
weakness down the road, he said.
    Based on chart formations, T-bond futures may be poised for
further gains, although the advance has been slowed recently,
analysts said.
    September T-bonds "are up almost six points since about May
18," Merrill Lynch debt analyst Jim Duggan noted. September
bond futures climbed from the low of 87 a month ago to over 93
in mid-June, Duggan said.
    While follow-through buying has aided the advance so far,
and bouts of short covering have prohibited a slide through
chart support, the rally in September T-bonds has been thwarted
above the 93 level.
    "The 93 level is formidable resistance and must be taken
out before this activity is anything other than a trading range
market," Carroll McEntee and McGinley Futures debt analyst
Brian Singer said.
    The dollar remains the key fundamental factor, and the U.S.
currency has made little headway of late, analysts said.
    "The critical variable remaining in the market is the value
of the dollar," Kahan said.
    Additional influences next week will be possible
developments ahead of an OPEC members meeting, and the impact
and size of the U.S. budget deficit, "although these will not
be in the forefront of the market early next week," Kahan said.
    In looking ahead to the U.S. Treasury mini-refunding
auctions of 24.25 billion in T-notes on Tuesday, Wednesday and
Thursday, Singer said the market will likely greet the results
with little excitement. However, a successful auction could
prove to be a turning point, depending on prevailing market
psychology.

Canada Post asked the federal government
to appoint a mediator to help end an increasingly violent
series of strikes by the country's letter carriers.
    The government is expected to respond quickly to the
request that was made after the union formally rejected the
corporation's latest offer to settle the four-day-old dispute.
    The state-run postal service also said it would halt the
use of replacement workers that the union has blamed for the
trouble on the picket line.
    "We have become increasingly concerned that the safety of
our employees, both striking employees and replacement workers,
is at risk," Canada Post negotiator Harold Dunstan told
reporters at a downtown Ottawa hotel.
    Robert McGarry, president of the 20,000 member Letter
Carriers Union, told reporters he and other union leaders would
consider suspending the walkouts for a week while the mediator
is involved.
    In a bid to step up pressure on management, letter carriers
walked out in Toronto today where some 50 pct of the country's
mail is sorted.
    Workers also set up picket lines in other populous cities
in southern Ontario, but went back to work in most other
centers across Canada.
    There have been several arrests, property damage, and
sometimes violent clashes between strikers and replacement
workers whom the corporation hired to try and keep the mail
moving.
    The Canadian Union of Postal Workers (CUPW), which
represents postal employees who are not letter carriers and
which is not on strike, said one of its workers was stabbed and
is now in the hospital after a scuffle broke out with a
replacement worker in Toronto early today.
    Police, however, said they had no report of a stabbing.
    CUPW President Jean-Claude Parrot called for the
resignation of Andre Harvie, minister responsible for Canada
Post, for condoning the use of the so-called strikebreakers.
    "The federal government has (the) blood of workers on its
hands in this postal strike," Parrot told reporters at the
union's Ottawa headquarters.

    Today, Manville lawyers said there have been about 54,000
claims filed by those injured by asbestos.
    The reorganization plan also sets up a trust fund, with
initial funding of 125 mln dlrs, to pay for property damage
claims. Additional funds will be available if needed. Manville
said there are currently 9,500 property damage claims filed.
    Manville filed for bankruptcy in 1982 and its
reorganization plan was approved by all parties except the
common stockholders.
   
    The stockholders objected to the proposal because it would
greatly dilute the value of their holdings. The plan would have
the effect of converting every eight shares of common stock
into just one share.
    Manville lawyers today criticized shareholder groups for
further delaying the execution of the bankruptcy plan. Herbert
Edelman, one of Manville's lawyers, pointed out that many
thousands of victims and creditors were still awaiting payments
and that many victims had already died.
    He also pointed out that the bankruptcy court had found
Manville to be insolvent.
    "They (shareholders) want the plan put aside to get that
nebulous value that may be down the road," Edelman said.
    Common shareholders claim they were not adequately
represented because U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland
refused requests to divide the equity holders committee into
two separate groups, one repesenting common shareholders and
the other preferred stock shareholders.
    During confirmation hearings of the plan, the equity
committee's lawyer George Hahn walked out of the hearing,
saying he could not represent both groups.
    The equity holders committee was then abolished.
   
    An unofficial committee representing 10 pct of the
company's stock was present at the confirmation hearings.
However, lawyers for that committee did not present evidence or
cross examine witnesses.
    During today's hearing Paul Gonson, a Washington lawyer
representing the Securities and Exchange Commission, told Judge
Knapp that the agency was also concerned that the shareholders
did not have adequate representation.
    Knapp said the unofficial committee was represented by the
New York law firm of Kronish, Lieb, Weiner and Hellman. "They
have one of the best law firms in town," Knapp said.

Prospects for Tokyo stocks are mixed this
week with investors trying to figure out the future of the
yen/dollar exchange rate and digest the implications of OPEC's
latest accord on crude output and pricing, brokers said.
    They said the market should extend the dull trend it has
been in since the 225-share index fell rapidly from the record
close at 25,929.42 on June 17.
    It ended at 24,902.72 on Saturday and fell further this
morning to close at 24,707.68 in an uncertain reaction to the
weaker yen and the weekend OPEC accord.
    Brokers said attention could focus more on the cheaper,
less well-known stocks in the exchange's first and second
sections, which were generally showing more resilience. The
second section index, in contrast to the first, closed at a
record 2,404.64 on June 26, surpassing the peak set on June 17
of 2,401.71.
    "Probably shares of companies involved in the domestic
economy are a good bet," said a broker at Daiwa Securities Co
Ltd. He said his observation was based on figures showing that
business activity in Japan is booming.
    The government said on Friday that department store and
supermarket sales rose 7.5 pct in May from a year earlier,
while orders received by Japan's 50 major construction firms in
the same month were up 7.6 pct year on year. Brokers expected
more such figures, but said many stocks linked to domestic
demand remain overpriced.
    "They are hard to find, but companies with an attractive
niche in the domestic economy, unaffected by currency
movements, are the best bet," said a broker at a foreign
securities house who declined to be identified.
    But sharp rises in money supply and voracious domestic
consumption are stirring inflation fears. The consumer price
index rose 0.2 pct in May from April, the third consecutive
month on month increase.
    Although investors are not unduly worried about inflation,
which erodes the real value of stock holdings, they say rising
prices arouse concern that interest rates may climb.
    The recent market advances have been assuming a further cut
in Japan's 2.5 pct discount rate. Such assumptions have now
died, discouraging investors, brokers said.
    If oil prices rise, the stock market in Japan could suffer
a downturn as higher production costs stir inflation.
    But share prices of Japan's oil importing companies may
also firm, brokers said. "I have never been able to justify this
because it should mean that the cost of importing rises," said a
broker at Yamaichi Securities Co. "It just always happens."
    Export-oriented companies may continue their recent rally
if the dollar climbs against the yen. But prices of many blue
chip exporters have risen fast over the last two weeks, making
them look less attractive, brokers said.
    However, if the dollar falls to about 140 or 138 yen, the
market index may rally, brokers said. A lower dollar could damp
down rising capital outflows into dollar investments from
Japan's stock and bond markets, brokers said.
    And as the yen/dollar rate is supposed to reflect the
balance of trade between the United States and Japan, a lower
dollar would bring more pressure on Japan to expand its demand
for American imports by stimulating its local economy, brokers
said.
    "If the dollar falls, buy domestic, if it rises, maybe buy a
few exporters," said one foreign broker.

Bank fuer Gemeinwirtschaft AG's
<BKFG.F> (BfG) partial operating profits in the first four
months of this year were lower than in the same period in 1986,
management board chairman Thomas Wegscheider said.
    But the balance sheet total at the end of May was four pct
higher than one year earlier as savings continued to flow into
the bank, he told the annual press conference.
    BfG parent bank partial operating profits halved to 166 mln
marks in 1986 from 311 mln in 1985, with the balance sheet
falling to 48.80 billion marks from 49.02 billion.
    Wegscheider declined to give a forecast for the full year,
and noted that the first four months of this year were not
comparable with the 1986 period as first quarter 1986 had been
extremely successful for the bank.
    The general banking environment this year was not easy,
with the interest margin under pressure, securities business
suffering from markedly lower bourse turnover than last year
and sluggish credit demand, he said.
    "As far as the specific BfG environment is concerned, we
note a clear atmospheric improvement, which however is being
reflected in the figures only slowly," he added.
    Wegscheider said the bank was recovering from speculation
about its ownership, which had unnerved many customers last
year, and from the financial crisis involving the Neue Heimat
housing group linked to BfG's former trade union owners.
    Insurer Aachener und Muenchener Beteiligungs-AG <AMVG.F>,
AMB, acquired 50 pct plus one share of BfG late last year.
    Wegscheider said that earnings from trading on the bank's
own account in 1986 had been a little higher than partial
operating profits, but had performed better in the first half.
    Following the AMB acquisition, BfG sold its 25.01 pct stake
in <Volksfuersorge Deutsche Lebensversicherung AG>, its 74.9
pct in <BSV Bank fuer Sparanlagen und Vermoegensbildung AG> and
five pct of <Allgemeine Hypothekenbank AG>.
    These sales produced extraordinary earnings of 700 mln
marks, with parent bank earnings from profit transfer
agreements rising to 494.18 mln marks in 1986 from 54.24 mln in
1985, and other earnings including writing bank risk provisions
rising to 317.95 mln marks from 65.67 mln.
    Wegscheider said most of the extraordinary earnings went
into risk provisions.
    Total risk provisions, undetailed, were more than twice as
high as in 1985, Wegscheider said. Published group risk
provisions rose to 865.9 mln marks from 366.7 mln. But the
share of credits to problem countries covered by risk
provisions was still below 50 pct at BfG, he said.
    The BSV Bank stake sale was one of the main factors behind
a 3.8 billion mark drop in the group balance sheet in 1986.
    Wegscheider said the re-organization of BfG, planned before
the AMB acquisition and involving a decentralization, would
occupy much of BfG's energies this year. BfG and AMB were also
looking at ways of cooperating in sales of services.

The World Bank is prepared to play a
more aggressive role in promoting Third World development and
easing the debt crisis, bank president Barber Conable said.
    "We must be realistic about the immediate prospects for an
expansion in voluntary commercial bank lending, with the World
Bank playing an even more vigorous role in the debt crisis,"
Conable said in an interview with Newsweek magazine.
    Conable said the bank must step in to help relieve the debt
crisis, which has prompted a number of U.S. Commercial banks to
write off a portion of their Third World loans.
    "Our plans include initiatives on the debt front, as well as
greater emphasis on debt-equity swaps and the promotion of
private investment in Third World countries through our
affiliate, the International Finance Corporation," Conable said.
"The bank is primarily a development institution, not a
debt-management agency. But debt must be managed effectively or
it hampers development."
    Conable defended his reorganisation plan for the bank,
which he said was aimed at improving efficiency and limiting
bureaucracy. He added environmental considerations would play a
larger role in the evaluation of proposed projects.

Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's
diminishing hopes of overhauling the tax system have been dealt
a serious blow by reports of sharply higher than expected tax
revenues in 1986/87, government officials said.
    Nakasone has argued that the tax system must be reformed to
provide the revenue for more than 1,000 billion yen of tax cuts
promised in the government's emergency economic package last
month. But his argument has been undercut by reports that the
1986/87 tax take was as much as 2,500 billion yen more than
expected.
    That means the government should have more than enough
money in the fiscal year ending next March to pay for the
planned tax cuts without having recourse to the unpopular tax
measures proposed by Nakasone, one official said.
    The Prime Minister has proposed an indirect tax and the
abolition of tax breaks on small savings as ways of raising
revenue to offset the tax cuts.
    But stiff opposition has forced him to shelve the idea of
an indirect tax, at least for the time being. He still hopes to
gain parliamentary approval next month to abolish tax breaks on
small savings.
    The higher than expected revenues in 1986/87 partly stemmed
from increased receipts from land and securities taxes, as
prices of both shares and land soared, one official said.
    But corporate tax revenues have also been more buoyant than
expected, perhaps indicating the recession of the last year
induced by the strong yen was not as bad as thought, he said.
    The final figures for 1986/87 revenues are due to be
released by the Finance Ministry on July 1.
    The higher revenues last fiscal year have also undercut
attempts by the Finance Ministry's budget bureau to reduce
investment spending by government departments in the 1988/89
budget, several officials said.
    A budget bureau official said the bureau still wanted to
stick with its so-called "minus-ceiling" policy, which calls for
government departments to reduce investment spending by five
pct a year.
    But he acknowledged this would be difficult, given the
sharp increase in revenues last fiscal year and heavy domestic
and U.S. Pressure on the ministry to stimulate the economy.

Share analysts and commentators say
Volkswagen AG <VOWG.F> has suffered an enormous loss of face
from which it could take time to recover over its 473 mln mark
currency swindle.
    An auditors' report on the affair, prepared in time for
this week's annual shareholders' meeting, largely cleared the
management of Volkswagen of blame.
    But "mud sticks," said Gavin Launder, an analyst with
Scrimgeour Vickers in London.
    (See index on ECRA)
    The financial daily, Boersenzeitung, wrote in a commentary:
"More devastating than the losses linked to the currency scandal
is the resulting loss of image for the company."
    VW had to make provisions of 473 mln marks to cover losses
from unauthorised foreign exchange deals which the auditors,
Deutsche Treuhand-Gesellschaft, said highlighted major gaps in
the supervisory apparatus of the firm's financial department.
    The auditors' report highlighted failings in VW's
controlling system, especially in relation to a 385 mln mark
deal with the Hungarian National Bank, but shed little light on
why they were made. 
    It said the contracts did not benefit VW and were only
advantageous to its banks. It did not detail how the foreign
exchange dealers may have profitted.
    It concluded: "The nature, scope and technical construction
of the deals ... Suggest a targeted and professionally executed
manipulation to the detriment of VW."
    The head of the finance department, Rolf Selowsky, resigned
days after the scandal broke in March. He is not accused of any
wrongdoing, but auditors concluded he had "not applied the
necessary diligence in all instances."
    Two former VW foreign exchange dealers have been arrested.
    But even VW admits that the report, published last week,
revealed important company failings.
    Peter Frerk, who has temporarily taken over Selowsky's
reponsibilities, said the findings were "not a first class
acquittal." The currency swindle was a "lamentable event for our
company," he told journalists.
    The auditors said the remaining members of VW's management
board and supervisory board had correctly fulfilled their
obligations, a verdict which almost certainly means that major
West German banks, who vote on behalf of large numbers of
shareholders, will ratify both boards at the July 2 meeting.
    Many market analysts, especially in London, do not believe
a sharp rise in VW's share price last week reflects a major
reassessment of the firm on the basis of the auditors' report.
    The stock closed at 430 marks on Friday, up 11 pct from a
week earlier. Dealers referrred to short-term bargain-hunting,
and one London broker said "I'm not sure it's much of a bargain."
Most brokers said they would not recommend clients to buy at
these levels.
    Analysts believe VW will do well to match its 1986 group
net profit of 582 mln marks this year, and one broker in London
said the company would be lucky to report profits only 15 pct
down.
    VW is expected to fare very well both in its home market
and in Europe. But sales have fallen sharply in the U.S and
Brazil, where the latest price freeze could exacerbate results
even further.
    The company hopes to benefit in the long term from its
takeover of the Spanish company SEAT, but this subsidiary is
still producing losses.
    VW has also just announced a deal to build light pick-up
trucks with Toyota Motor Corp <TOYO.T> at an under-utilised
plant in Hanover, but analysts noted production here was only
expected to take off fully in 1990.

Degussa AG <DGSG.F> said it planned a
one-for-five rights issue at 225 marks per share, raising
nominal share capital by 61 mln marks, by the end of its
current business year ending September 30.
    The company said in a statement it would also raise nominal
share capital by 20 mln marks in a share swap as part of its
planned takeover of French medicine group <Laboratoires Sarget
SA>.
    The two capital measures will raise Degussa nominal share
capital to 365 mln marks.
    Degussa said last week it intended to buy 100 pct of the
capital of the medical pharmaceuticals group Sarget, based in
Merignac near Bordeaux.
    Sarget had 1986 sales in France, Belgium, the Netherlands,
Spain, Portugal and Italy of 730 mln French francs.
    Degussa has not said how much it would pay for Sarget, but
20 mln marks nominal of 50-mark shares, at today's Frankfurt
opening price of 494.70 marks, would be worth nearly 198 mln
marks.
    A 61 mln mark nominal capital increase at 225 marks would
raise 274.5 mln marks.
    Degussa said the 20 mln mark nominal capital increase would
take the form of an issue of shares for a non-cash
consideration. The April 10 annual meeting agreed that there
would be no rights issue on this capital, which was already
authorized but unissued.
    The rights issue involving the 61 mln mark nominal capital
increase will be led by Dresdner Bank AG. Following that
capital increase, Degussa would be left with 19 mln marks of
authorized but unissued capital, a Degussa spokesman said.
    Part of the 274.5 mln marks from the rights issue would
also be used for the Serget acquisition, he added.

Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said
West Germany would be badly advised to lower interest rates and
that he believed the economy would continue to recover after a
six-month lull.
    Asked by the newspaper Bild am Sonntag if lower interest
rates could boost the domestic economy, Poehl said: "We would be
badly advised if we forced further interest rate cuts.
    "This could, under certain circumstances, release new
inflationary fears which would then be more likely to lead to
higher interest rates," he added.

    Poehl said Germany had practically no growth in the past
six months because of the mark's surge and the cold winter.
    "But since April, statistics clearly show that the economy
finds itself on a course of growth," he said. "I expect this
development to continue in the coming months."
    Asked about his expectations of a U.S.-European Community
trade war, Poehl said such an event would be disastrous.
    "For this reason we in Europe must avoid everything used by
protectionist forces in the U.S. As pretexts," he added. "This
includes...Eliminating existing restrictions in the EC as far
as possible. Protectionism is not found only in the U.S."

France's state-run television channel
TF-1, which is in the process of being privatised, should
achieve a profit of around 25 francs per share next year after
several years of losses, but will not make a profit this year,
the new TF-1 president Francis Bouygues said.
    Interviewed on TF-1 on the eve of the public flotation of
40 pct of the channel's equity, Bouygues said "in 1988 we have
to make a profit, and we will make a profit."
    "I envisage per share profits of 25 francs," he said. "I am
very optimistic."

    Bouygues said exceptional costs associated with the
restructuring of the station would prevent a profit this year.
    The state sold a 50 pct stake in TF-1 in April to a
consortium led by Bouygues, a construction magnate, and
including British press baron Robert Maxwell.
    Tomorrow 40 pct of the shares go on sale to the public at
165 francs each, while 10 pct will be offered at a special
price of 132 francs a share to the station's staff.
    Bouygues said a dividend would be paid to shareholders next
year if the station did return to profit.

    Asked if he thought the flotation price was right, Bouygues
said, "I paid virtually double...I consider that it is a good
buy."
    The Bouygues consortium paid three billion francs for its
50 pct controlling stake in April.
    After the two-week public flotation, TF-1 shares will start
trading on the second market here in late July.

Henkel KGaA <HNKG.F> expects 1987
world group turnover and profit to exceed 1986 levels as recent
acquisitions should compensate for the negative impact of the
strong mark, managing board chairman Helmut Sihler said.
    He told the annual meeting that based on Henkel's
performance so far, the profit increase would be "not
insignificant."
    World group sales rose six pct in the first five months
this year compared with the same 1986 period but group turnover
rose only two pct because of currency factors, he said.
    Sihler said the profit increase surpassed that of turnover
but gave no figure.
    As reported, group net profit rose 28 pct to 226 mln marks
in 1986. World group sales by volume rose six pct but currency
factors trimmed group turnover by six pct to 8.7 billion marks.
    Sihler said the 1986 profit/sales ratio of 2.6 pct should
rise further this year.
    Sihler said turnover grew more or less equally in all
sectors.
    As reported, the 1986 dividend on ordinary voting shares
rose to 4.50 marks from 3.50 in 1985 while the dividend on
non-voting preference shares increased to 7.50 marks compared
with three marks for six months of 1985.

British Airways Plc's <BAB.L> May
passenger and cargo traffic figures provided evidence of

King told the annual meeting.
    Earlier this month, the newly-privatised airline reported a

traffic up 22 pct.
    In the year to March, British Airways reported a drop in
pre-tax profits to 162 mln stg from 195 mln previously.
However, King said this result was satisfactory, considering
the difficulties posed by the Chernobyl disaster and the U.S.
Raid on Libya.
    He said British Airways intended to return its tour travel
operations to profitability, when questioned by shareholders.
    In 1986/87, this division reported an operating loss of
nine mln stg, the fifth year of losses. However, he said the
group might reconsider its course of action if a turnaround

Enetertainment Marketing Inc and its
president Elias Zinn have demanded a list of Crazy Eddie Inc
shareholders from the company and said they may pursue a merger
of the Edison, N.J. electronics retailer.
    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Zinn said the demand for the shareholder list was made on June
26 because he may desire to communicate with other Crazy Eddie
shareholders "regarding the affairs" of the company.
    Zinn and his firm, which disclosed they hold a 5.1 pct
stake in Crazy Eddie common stock, said they may acquire more
shares through a negotiated merger or tender offer.
    Entertainment Marketing was informed on June 25 by Shearson
Lehman Brothers Inc., acting on behalf of Crazy Eddie, that it
would be provided with "certain information" about Crazy Eddie,
it told the SEC.
    Entertainment Marketing, a Houston-based firm involved in
electronics wholesaling and televised home shopping sales,
proposed an eight dlr a share merger acquisition of Crazy Eddie
on May 29, and modified the proposal on June 9 to include the
possible participation of Crazy Eddie management.
    Entertainment Marketing told the SEC it expects to meet
with Crazy Eddie representatives in the near future.
    Entertainment Marketing also disclosed that it retained
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc as its financial advisor and
investment banker.
    In light of a June 17 announcement from Crazy Eddie that
Chemical Bank would no longer fund a 52 mln dlr credit facility
with the company, plus further declines in the price of its
stock, Entertainment Marketing and Zinn said they are
"continuing to evaluate their alternatives with respect to
their investment" in Crazy Eddie stock.
    Depending on its evaluation of the company, including
actions by Crazy Eddie's board and any possible third party
bids for the company, Entertainment Marketing and its president
said they may hold their present stake in the company, sell
some of their shares, or purchase more shares on the open
market, through private purchases or in connection with a
merger or tender offer.
    According to the SEC filing, Entertainment Marketing and
Zinn bought their current holdings of 1,560,000 Crazy Eddie
common shares between May 20 and June 17 at 7.42 dlrs to 7.93
dlrs a share, or a total of about 11.9 mln dlrs.

Weekend rain over the Western Corn Belt
brought further relief to crop areas that had been dry earlier
this month, and developing weather patterns will bring welcome
moisture to central and eastern belt locations this week,
according to Dale Mohler, senior meteorologist for Accu-Weather
Inc.
    "There is going to be more rain for the next two, three
days," he said. "We're in a fairly wet pattern with normal to
above normal moisture this week."
    Mohler said rainfall averaged 1/2 inch across southern
Minnesota, 3/4 inch over southwest Iowa, one inch in eastern
Nebraska and 1-1/2 inches in south-central Nebraska.
    Illinois fields saw virtually no rain over the weekend but
were receiving scattered thundershower activity today, he said.
    Rain patterns will move across Indiana to Ohio with
thudershower activity yielding to more general rains, he said.
    "Tomorrow, that eastern area will get 1/4 to one inch, a
pretty good rain," Mohler said.
    Rain was heavier than expected over the weekend, sparking
an early selloff in soybean futures at the Chicago Board of
Trade. Prices were off 14 to 20-1/2 cents with November off
19-1/2 cents at 5.43-1/2 dlrs.
    Mohler said the cold front now over the eastern belt is
expected to move over the central Midwest, then move north
later in the week. That could bring new rain patterns across
the Corn Belt and assure good crop conditions as
early-developed corn moves into the crucial pollination stage
in early July, he said.

The Federal Reserve Board said it
approved Citicorp's application to purchase through its
subsidiary, Citicorp Savings of Oakland, Calif., some assets
and assume some liabilities of Sears Savings Bank of Glendale,
Calif.
    Citicorp Savings proposed to assume two billion dlrs in
deposits and other liabilities and to purchase 1.9 billion dlrs
in assets of 50 branch offices of Sears Savings.
    The proposal involved less than one third of the assets and
liabilities of Sears Savings, owned by Sears, Roebuck and Co
<S>.
    The Fed said that it generally has determined there were
potentially adverse effects of allowing affiliations of banks
and savings and loan associations, although it has allowed bank
holding companies to acquire some failing thrifts.
    It said Citicorp's proposal "properly may be viewed as the
permissible acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of S
and L branches rather than the acquisition of an S and L."
    Citicorp Savings, the successor to the failed Fidelity
Savings and Loan Association, has assets of 4.9 billion dlrs
and operates 86 branches in California, mainly in the north.
    Sears Savings has 6.6 billion in assets and 91 branches
predominantly in southern California.
    The application, which was approved unanimously, will not
eliminate Sears Savings as a competitor, the Fed said.

The Securities and Exchange
Commission charged Allied Stores Corp with failing to promptly
disclose key steps it was taking last September to thwart a
takeover attempt by Campeau Corp.
    In an administrative complaint, the SEC said Allied and its
legal adviser failed to promptly inform shareholders and the
agency that it had begun talks with Youngstown, Ohio, shopping
center developer Edward DeBartolo in response to Campeau's
takeover offer.
    Campeau acquired Allied for an estimated 4.2 billion dlrs
on Jan 1, following a battle with DeBartolo.
    On Sept 25, a day after Allied disclosed that its board had
urged rejection of Campeau's Sept 12 tender offer for 58 dlrs a
share, Allied began negotiating the sale of six shopping
centers to DeBartolo, the SEC said.
    Allied legal advisor and director George Kern, who heads
the merger and acquisitions group at the New York law firm of
Sullivan and Cromwell, decided against amending Allied's SEC
filing to disclose the talks even though they had resulted in
sales price of 405 mln dlrs for the shopping centers, it said.
    Securities law requires takeover target companies to
promptly disclose such things as the sale of major assets.
    The day after Campeau increased its tender offer to 80 pct
of Allied's stock from 55 pct and raised its bid to 66 dlrs a
share from 58 dlrs on Sept 29, Allied and a partnership headed
by DeBartolo began negotiating a takeover deal aimed at
thwarting Campeau, the SEC said.
    Kern again decided against disclosing the talks in an
amended SEC filing, the agency charged.
    Allied's first disclosure of the DeBartolo takeover was
made on Oct 8, even though its board approved the merger on Oct
3 and the merger agreement was executed on Oct 7, the complaint
said.
    DeBartolo and Campeau later engaged in a bitter battle for
control of Allied, with Campeau winning out later in October
when it bought a block of 25.8 mln shares of Allied stock, or
48 pct of the total, in a controversial move made only minutes
after it dropped its hostile tender offer.
    The acquisition of the additional 48 pct, which a federal
judge allowed to be completed, gave Campeau a majority stake in
Allied. Campeau bought the rest at 69 dlrs a share.
    The SEC said it had planned to file a court brief joining
with Allied in charging that Campeau had engaged in an illegal
tender offer.
    But the SEC brief was never filed since the case was
dropped following an agreement between Campeau and DeBartolo.
    In the administrative proceeding against Allied and Kern,
the SEC is asking for an administrative order that they comply
with reporting provisions of securities laws in the future.
    Although Allied is no longer publicly traded since it
became a subsidiary of Campeau, it still files annual and
quarterly reports to the SEC because it has outstanding debt.

The American Hospital Association said
the best way to prevent the spread of AIDS to hospital workers
is for workers to wear protective clothing rather than through
routine tests of all hospital patients for the disease.
    The non-profit advocacy organization, which represents
hospitals and patients, recommended that hospital workers
should wear protective gear whenever there is a chance they
will be exposed to blood or other bodily fluids, regardless of
whether the fluids are known to be infected with AIDS.
    The group also said that "reliance on negative AIDS test
results to determine when to take specific precautions can lead
to a false sense of security among health care workers."
    So far there are nine cases on record of hospital workers
contracting AIDS from hospital patients. Despite the low risk
of contracting, the group said, "Hospital workers are
understandly concerned about their vulnerability (to AIDS)."
    There are 3.6 mln workers in the nation's hospitals with
nurses and housekeepers the most likely to come in contact with
blood and body fluids on a daily basis, the group said.
    Among the Americal Hospital Association's recommendations
were that health care workers exposed to body fluids must wear
gloves, and in some cases, gowns, masks, and eye coverings.

stock
market deregulation -- will be heard Tuesday when the Canadian
securities industry sets off its own fireworks.
    Some companies are quickly taking advantage of
deregulation, but more significant moves are likely to be a
year or more down the road, analysts say.
    They say most foreign firms will focus at first on bond
trading, debt financing and underwriting, areas in which they
have experience under the old rules that allowed them to
provide government debt financing and advisory services.
    "When they learn about Canada, they might go into retail,"
said Carney at Merrill Lynch Canada. "Then they will eventually
just start to buy up the little guys. If the bigger boys' price
comes down, they'll end up taking those ones over too."
    Under the new rules, barriers that kept banks, brokerage
houses, insurance companies and trust firms out of each others'
businesses will be swept away in favor of wide-open
competition.
    The deregulation, sometimes nicknamed "Little Bang," will
allow Canadian banks and other domestic financial institutions
to set up securities units or acquire existing brokerages.
    Foreign companies will also be able to form their own
securities divisions in Ontario or buy up to 50 pct of a
Canadian firm. A year from now they can raise that stake to 100
pct. Foreign firms that entered Canada after 1971 can currently
own no more than 10 pct of a Canadian brokerage.
    Deregulation was expected to generate a major shakeout by
June 30, involving mergers of existing firms and buyouts by
foreign and domestic financial giants.
    So far few deals have become reality, however, despite a
swirl of rumors and merger talks. In the heat of deregulation
fever, many Canadian investment dealers are demanding up to
four times book value, scaring off prospective suitors,
analysts said.
    "I would think they (the brokerages) will have to lower
their asking prices," said financial services analyst Jeff
Carney at Merrill Lynch Canada Inc., which recently terminated
talks to acquire prominent Canadian brokerage Burns Fry Ltd.
    "I think (a high asking price) is what scared Merrill Lynch
away from Burns Fry," added Carney. "It is just a lot of money.
When your asset walks out the door every night, it is difficult
to pay that amount of cash."
    Carney said another factor in the slow pace of buyouts was
uncertainty about the final deregulation rules, which were
issued and approved only in mid-June.
    Most major foreign and Canadian financial players have
focused their deregulation strategy on planning their own
Canadian securities units or buying seats on the Toronto Stock
Exchange, Canada's largest equities market.
    Japan's Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Yamaichi Securities Co.
Ltd., Daiwa Securities Co. Ltd. and Nikko Securities Co. Ltd.
recently bought seats on Toronto's exchange, while United
States investment banks such as Salomon Inc. and Goldman, Sachs
and Co. have set plans for Canadian subsidiaries.
    The few proposed foreign investments in Ontario firms
include agreements by New York's Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
to raise its stake in McLeod Young Weir Ltd. to 30 pct from 10
pct and by the British firm of James Capel and Co. to acquire a
minority interest in Brown, Baldwin, Nisker Ltd.
    Several industry watchers predict the flood of foreign
acquisitions is likely a year away, when the newcomers become
familiar with Canada.
    Canadian firms will need such international alliances to
compete in the increasingly global securities market, industry
officials said.
    "That is one of the hopes of the regulators, that the change
will throw off one or two Canadian global firms," Toronto Stock
Exchange president Pearce Bunting told

Corporate mergers and acquisitions
in and around San Francisco over the past seven years have had
only a modest effect on the metropolitan area's economy, a
leading business-backed organization said.
    The Bay Area Council, a group of more than 300 business
firms, said that a study of corporate restructuring in a
nine-county area found that San Francisco itself had suffered
some ill effects from corporate shake-ups but that surrounding
communities had not.
    Seventeen of the 32 Fortune 500 companies in the area left
due to corporate restructuring between 1979 and 1986, but
another 21 firms were added to the list.
    Ten of the departing companies were based in San Francisco.
During the period, only six located in the city achieved
Fortune 500 status.
    Ted Hall, a council director and local managing director of
McKinsey and Co. which conducted the survey, said the study
grew out of concern that mergers and acquisitions had seriously
hurt the economic climate of northern California.
    However, Hall said that only about 36,000 jobs had been
lost in the region, while more than 600,000 new jobs were
created during the period.
    At the same time, he said, the region experienced a greater
rise in per capita income and lower unemployment than the rest
of the United States and California.
    Council President George Keller, who also is chairman and
chief executive officer of Chevron Corp., told a news
conference that the region had difficulties in persuading
companies to locate there because of a fragmented local
political system.
    But he said that because of the amenities of living in San
Francisco, he was the envy of many chief executives in other
metropolitan area.
    "It's a great place to run a business," he added, "but it's
a hell of a place to do business with government."
    The study concluded that Chevron, which mergered with Gulf
Oil in 1984, would benefit in the long run from the
restructuring activity.
    Among the corporate headquarters lost during the period
were Crown Zellerbach, Memorex, Southern Pacific, Castle &
Cooke and Rolm.
    Companies that grew enough during the period to make the
Fortune 500 list included Apple Computer, Pacific Telesis,
McKesson, Tandem Computer, U.S. Leasing and Amfac.
    The study by the management consulting firm said that,
partly due to corporate restructuring, the rate of job growth
in San Francisco has slowed since 1980.
    In addition, it said that the loss of corporate leadership
had adversely affected some of the Bay Area's civic and
charitable activities.

Court documents filed with the U.S.
bankruptcy court by attorneys for Allis-Chalmers Corp <AH>
listed Equitable Life Assurance Co as one of the largest
creditors.
    According to the court papers, Equitable was owed a total
of 468,859 dlrs. Other creditors included Connecticut General
Life Insurance Co, owed 192,520 dlrs, and New York Life
Insurance Co, owed 146,553 dlrs.
    The list of unsecured creditors was headed by KHIC America
Corp, of Rutheford, New Jersey, which was owed 663,950 dlrs.
   
    Second on the list of unsecured creditors was a group of
paving contractors owed 600,000 dlrs.
    Manville Corp <MAN> was third with 471,157 dlrs owed.
    Allis-Chalmers said that on Dec 31 the unfunded pension
liabilities totaled 44 mln dlrs.
    It said that it intended to carry out a reorganization by
disposing of businesses that do not contribute adequately to
cash flow. The company said it plans to eliminate unprofitable
product lines and emphasize more profitable product lines.
    Allis-Chalmers said it intended to obtain workforce
reductions and seek monetary and other concessions from
salaried and hourly employees.
    It said it will eliminate operations of facilities that are
marginal performers. The company said it plans to discontinue
burdensome contracts and leases as well as collective
bargaining agreements.
    The company said it believes creditors will realize more
from a reorganization than from a liquidation.
    The documents said Allis-Chalmers has suffered substantial
losses since 1981 due to sales declines caused by fierce
competition and a sluggish global economy.
    It said a restructuring plan, which it has already 
instituted, adversely affected cash flow because certain costs
including product liability and retiree medical and pension
costs continued as before despite a reduction in the size of
its business.

The Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) announced plans to disapprove clean-air plans for 14
metropolitan areas and called for bans in those areas on new
construction of potentially polluting facilties.
    EPA Administrator Lee Thomas said in a statement the areas
had not shown they could meet agency ozone or carbon-monoxide
air-quality standards by the end of 1987 or soon after.
    He said the proposed ban on construction would cover such
industries as electric utilities, iron and steel production
plants, industrial boilers and petroleum refineries.
    The areas affected are Chicago; the Indiana portion of the
Chicago area; East St. Louis, Ill.; the Indiana portion of the
Louisville, Ky., area; Cleveland, Ohio; Atlanta, Ga.;
Dallas-Ft. Worth, Tex.; Denver, Colo.; the California south
coast, including Los Angeles; Fresno, Sacramenta, Ventura and
Kern counties, Calif., and Washoe County (Reno), Nev.
    Thomas also proposed major changes to existing sources of
pollution in those areas.  They would effective after a final
assessment of the area's pollution, expected late this year or
early next.
    For Cleveland, the EPA also proposed a restriction on
federal highway funding and clean-air grants because the state
of Ohio did not provide for adequate testing to curb car
pollutions as required by the Clean AirAct.
    Thomas said:
    "It is clear that the state implementation plans for these
areas will not achieve federal ozone or carbon-monoxide
standards under the deadline mandated by Congress. In these
circumstances the Clean Air Act leaves no discretion.  I must
propose sanctions."
    The EPA estimated that another 20 metropolitan areas will
fail to meet the agency's ozone standards by the end of the
year. About 70 are meeting the ozone standards.
    It added that about 80 areas are now not meeting the EPA
carbon-monoxide standards, but only a few will have long-term
problems in meeting the standards.
    The EPA has proposed that car-makers be ordered to install
canisters on new cars beginning in 1979 to capture polluting
gasoline vapors which escape when gas is pumped from filling
stations to a car's gas tank.

Canadian Tire Corp Ltd said it still
hopes a special board committee can solve a voting rights
dispute between class A and common stock shareholders.
    "Although no such proposal has yet been developed, the
directors hope that such a result can be achieved," chairman
Hugh Macaulay said at the annual meeting.
    The committee, formed last fall, has been trying to
determine the voting rights of class A non-voting shares if
control of the company changes hands.
   
    The Ontario Securities Commission blocked a 270 mln dlr
takeover bid last January for 49 pct of the company's common
shares.
    The OSC said the bid by a group of Canadian Tire store
owners abused shareholders rights by circumventing share
provisions that would convert non-voting stock into voting
shares if more than 50 pct of the stock changed ownership.
    Since then, three members of the Billes family, who agreed
to tender their 60 pct holding of Canadian Tire's common shares
to the pro rata offer, have commenced legal proceedings amongst
themselves.
    Macaulay said he would not comment further on the situation
"while matters remain in an unsettled state".
    At the meeting, president Dean Groussman said the higher
profit trend evident in the first quarter ended April 4 was
continuing. First quarter net rose 10 pct to 21.1 mln dlrs from
19.2 mln dlrs a year earlier.
    Groussman also said the company plans sharply higher
capital spending this year of 103 mln dlrs, compared to 43 mln
dlrs last year, and it will likely maintain high levels of
capital investment in 1988 and 1989.

Sales of new single-family homes
tumbled 14.9 pct in May from April levels because of higher
mortgage interest rates, analysts said.
    "There should be another month or two of very weak new home
sales but with interest rates stabilizing, sale of new homes
should become more stable by mid-summer," said economist
Lawrence Chimerine of Wharton Econometrics Inc.
    The drop in May, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
616,000 units, was the largest since January 1982, the Commerce
Department said.
    Interest rates on conventional mortgages bottomed out at
about 9.08 pct in March and rose to about 10.7 pct in April,
according to Stephen Roach, economist at Morgan Stanley.
    The effect was to freeze some potential new homebuyers out
of the market, he and others said.
    "The rates moved very suddenly and were certainly
unexpected by homebuyers," said Cynthia Latta, an economist
with Data Resources. "They were so startled, they wanted to
hold back and see what would happen."
    The drop in sales of new single-family home sales was
sharper than expected, some economists said. "We fully expected
a decline but the extent was more than we anticipated," said
James Christian, chief economist for the U.S. League of Savings
Institutions.
    Christian said there was a sharp rise in May in sales of
existing homes, which are generally less expensive than new
homes.
    Latta of Data Resources said strong sales of new
condominiums in the Northeast and on the West Coast were
reflected in sales of existing but not new homes.
    Christian of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions said,
"Underlying housing demand remains strong. I think the market
is going to stabilize and give us a good second half."
    Others were less optimistic, however.
    "We clearly won't have a boom (in new home sales) but I
don't think this is the start of a collapse in single-family
housing," said Chimerine of Wharton.
    Eugene Sherman, chief economist of the Federal Home Loan
Bank of New York, said, "The lower sales level will be
maintained for awhile until there is another change in rates.
There won't be much specific improvement in coming months."

The Securities and Exchange
Commission's entry into the battle between Texaco Inc and
Pennzoil Co <PZL> could affect the outcome of the 10.3 billion
dlr legal saga, some analysts said.
    Texaco today said the SEC would file a "friend of the
court" brief on the tender offer rule as it pertains to the
case. Some analysts construed this as positive for Texaco since
they said it is alleged by Texaco that Pennzoil violated the
rule, and the issue was not thoroughly addressed in lower Texas
courts.
    Texaco's stock rose 1-1/2 to 39-3/8 and Pennzoil fell four
to 78-7/8. A Pennzoil attorney would not comment. He said the
SEC rule, 10b-13, is part of Texaco's argument in its request
for a Texas Supreme Court case, and that the matter has been
previously addressed in court. Pennzoil said it knew of the SEC
brief but it did not know whether the brief would support the
view of one litigant or be an inquiry and request for
clarification of the reasons for two lower state court
decisions.
    Texaco today said the SEC would urge the Texas Supreme
Court to accept the case for review with respect to the issue.
    Texaco has alleged Pennzoil violated the rule when it had a
tender offer for Getty Oil Co outstanding and then made an
alleged agreement on January 3, 1984, to buy Getty shares.
    Analysts said the SEC tender offer rule prevents those
making the offer from entering into contracts for the target
company's stock. Frederick Leuffer of C.J. Lawrence believes
SEC intervention could be meaningful but acknowledged it could
also have no affect. "If this friend of the court brief is
potent and clearly pro-Texaco, and is taken into account by the
Texas Supreme Court, there is a chance the entire judgment
could be reversed and Pennzoil gets nothing," Leuffer said.
    Texaco and Pennzoil have been locked in a bitter legal
battle over Texaco's acquisition of Getty Oil. A Texas court
awarded Pennzoil a record 10.53 billion dlrs in damages, later
reduced by two billion dlrs. With interest, the award now
totals 10.3 billion dlrs.
    Texaco filed for protection under chapter 11 of the federal
bankruptcy laws earlier this year. Its action was designed to
avoid having a Texas appeals court order it to post a security
bond for the entire amount of the Pennzoil judgement.
    Texaco earlier said the SEC will file its brief the week of
July 20.
    In his comments, Leuffer also reflected the views of other
analysts who believe are not convinced the SEC will play a
significant role. "The other argument is the court will ignore
it (the SEC brief) as it has all the other friend of the court
briefs," he said.
    Kidder Peabody and Co analyst Marc Cohen said he does not
expect the SEC's brief to change the direction of the case.
"Everyday, you're going to see something like this," Cohen
said.
    Texaco lawyer Jim Sales said it was only logical to believe
that the SEC would have sought to intervene in the case if it
believed the 10b-13 rule was involved. "I think what the market
sensed today is that there is a reminder here for Pennzoil that
they may reach for the stars and fall on their face," Sales
said. "They (Pennzoil) have won every case in Texas," said Joel
Fischer of Drexel Burnham Lambert. But Fischer and other
analysts said SEC involvement may raise questions of federal
law that could help Texaco take its case to the U.S. Supreme
Court if the Texas court does not reverse the lower opinions or
refuses to hear its case.
    Analysts said the lower courts did not give much weight to
the 10b-13 issue.
    Sales said the point was argued and the courts
"acknowledged that it was there but they really ignored the
legal affect of what the regulation required, and we hope we
can correct that misimpression".
    Wall Street analysts and arbitragers speculated on many
possible outcomes. One arbitrager said there was concern that
Texaco and Pennzoil could settle for a lower sum than demanded
by Pennzoil.
    "The SEC stepping in on this issue as an amicus curiae
(friend of the court) has a lot of arbitragers a little bit
disturbed," said Cohen.
    "What you're seeing is a continual chess game. Every slight
move down the road could have a multiplying effect," he said.

Negotiations resumed in the 14-day-old
strike by Canada's letter carriers and picket line violence
subsided after the federal government changed its mind and
appointed a mediator.
    The talks between the 20,000-member Letter Carriers Union
of Canada and government-owned Canada Post were the first since
Labor Minister Pierre Cadieux announced the appointment of a
mediator yesterday.
   
    There had been little progress between the parties last
week and both sides requested a mediator for the second time.
Cadieux originally said the two sides were too far apart to
warrant the help on an independent third party.
    Although the postal union said it would maintain its
strategy of selected rotating strikes across the country, only
the Montreal area was affected today and service was normal
elsewhere in Canada.
   
    Canada Post stuck by its promise to halt the use of
replacement workers for at least seven days if a mediator was
appointed and there were no reports of picket line violence.
    Canada Post, under government orders to eliminate a $160
million (U.S.) deficit by next year, has taken a tough stand in
the talks and the two sides remain far apart on wages and
working conditions.

Middle South Utilities Inc said the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has requested a 30-day
stay of a U.S. Court of Appeals ruling ordering the commission
to reconsider its allocation of costs from the Grand Gulf One
nuclear power plant.
    More than two years ago, FERC set the allocation af Grand
Gulf capacity and costs among the four Middle South operating
companies. These allocations, in turn, have become the basis
for contested rate filings the four operating utilities made to
regulators in their service areas.
    In a ruling dated June 24 and distributed June 26, the U.S.
Court of Appeals in Washington reversed its January 1987
decision and ordered FERC to explain its criteria for
determining undue discrimination and why the FERC's allocation
currently in effect is not unduly discriminatory under that
definition, Middle South said.
    The company said the ruling by the three-judge appeals
court panel "was totally unexpected, especially in light of the
timetable the full 11-member court set in April of this year
when it announced that all judges would rehear the panel's
January decision in which the panel had upheld FERC.
    In essence, Middle South said, "the three-member panel has
adopted the dissenting opinion as the new majority opinion, and
the full court has accepted the new decision."
    The company said it supports FERC's motion for a stay. The
commission said it needed the time to determine the appropriate
course it should take in light of the new court decision.
    "Given its complexity and the need for clarification by the
FERC, the significance of this latest order will take time to
determine," Middle South said in a statement.

The U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development (HUD) said it backed an eventual severing of
the link between the government and the Federal National
Mortgage Association -- better known as Fannie Mae.
    But the department, in a long-awaited report requested by
Congress in 1984, shied from setting a timetable for the giant
housing finance institution to end its government ties.
   Instead, it said specific recommendations would come in a
second report, to be issued jointly by Fannie Mae and HUD by
Oct. 1.
   "The basic policy directive underlying FNMA's history has
been consistent -- a gradual movement toward fully private
status. There appears to be no need to change that policy," the
HUD report said.
    Any change in Fannie Mae's status would be up to Congress.
    The HUD report said the options open to Congress ranged
from doing nothing to full and immediate privatization.
    "Whatever option is selected, the combination of the
favorable economic environment, FNMA's recent move to financial
health, the current strength of the housing market and the
evolution of FNMA's role in the mortgage market from
contributor to competitor would all indicate that the time is
ripe for a positive move toward privatization," the report
concluded.
    Fannie Mae operated as a part of the federal government
from the time it was created in 1938 until 1968, when it was
rechartered by Congress and put under private ownership with
government backing.
    However, "it was always intended that FNMA would eventually
become fully private," the HUD report said.
    Fannie Mae's critics, including some Reagan administration
officials espousing a free-market philosophy, say government
sponsorship of the agency allows it to compete unfairly with
private lenders and investors.
    But its backers claim mortgage rates would be pushed up as
higher agency costs were eventually passed on to home buyers.
    Fannie Mae was created by Congress to make capital
available for housing by buying mortgages from lenders and
packaging them as securities to sell investors.

Citicorp has extended its reach
into the California market with Citicorp Savings' acquisition
of 50 of Sears Roebuck's <S> Sears Savings Bank branches,
bringing its presences to 143 branches in 101 communities,
CitiCorp Savings said.
    Thrift industry analysts said the move, approved by the

its serious intent to penetrate the California market.
    The acquisition mostly extends Citicorp's reach into
Southern California, where 34 of the 50 branches are located.
Citicorp Savings was predominantly in Northern California.
    "This marks our first major expansion in California,
particularly in the south," said Citicorp Savings President
Edward Valencia, in a statement.
    Thrift industry sources said they do not see a major
near-term impact on the Southern California thrift market, but
do expect Citicorp to be a more aggressive competitor than
Sears was in that market.
    "We do believe they will be a better competitor than
Sears," said James Stutz, Executive Vice President of Home
Federal Savings and Loan Association <HFD>, based in San Diego.
    Banking industry sources said the move is viewed as
groundwork, to establish Citicorp throughout the California
market, well before the 1991 law change that will allow it to
operate as a bank in the state. They said Citicorp is likely to
convert the branches to banks at that time.

Star Technologies Inc said that a
settlement of a 1985 shareholder lawsuit has produced a 1.3 mln
dlr charge, which the company recorded in its fourth quarter
earnings.
    The company said it will pay the settlement with company
stock, subject to court approval.
    To reflect the settlement, therefore, the company said it
has revised its fiscal fourth quarter, ended March 31, earnings
by 1.3 mln dlrs, or nine cts per share on a primary basis.
    As such, the company said it is recording a net loss of
580,000 dlrs, or four cts a share, versus the net income of
740,000 dlrs previously reported.
    For the year to date ended March 31, net income was reduced
to 1.4 mln dlrs, from the 2.7 mln dlrs previously reported on
May 28.
    The class action suit, filed in a federal district court,
charged the company with various violations of federal
securities laws with regards to the company's initial public
offering in December, 1984 and certain subsequent filings.

More leading U.S. manufacturers plan to
increase the proportion of their U.S.-based production
vis-a-vis their overseas output over the next two years,
according to a Boston University School of Management survey.
    The Manufacturing Roundtable 1987 study showed 32 pct of
manufacturers plan to shift output to their domestic plants
from their overseas ones, or simply increase the production in
their U.S. plants.
    That was up from 19 pct expecting to make that shift in
1986, and only 12 pct in 1984.
    The Boston University survey canvassed 207 firms.

changes in their U.S./overseas operations, while 23.7 pct said
they would boost the ratio of overseas output, the poll said.

favored plans toward increased domestic production. But he

move towards greater production in the United States.

individual investors should remain calm. "It is advisable to

Government and monetary authorities today
staged a concerted effort to calm spreading panic on Japanese
stock exchanges but market analysts said there were limits to
their ability to succeed.
    "The ability of the Big Four (Japanese securities houses)
and the Finance Ministry is limited," said Barclays de Zoete
Wedd economist Peter Morgan.
    Finance Ministry officials asked the big four securities
companies this afternoon to help calm panic selling on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange, ministry officials said.
    Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone was quoted by Kyodo News
Service as saying he was watching the stock market situation.
    But he rejected comparisons with the 1929 stock market
collapse and subsequent recession.
    Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the Tokyo stock
market should not be gravely affected by downturns in New York
and London because there are clear signs of a Japanese economic
recovery and exchange rate stability.
    Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita also tried to calm
the panic, saying in a statement that world stock markets were
excessively concerned about the economic future.
    Traditionally, the four big houses  -- Nomura Securities Co
Ltd, Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd, Daiwa Securities Co Ltd, and
Nikko Securities Co Ltd -- have influenced the market because
of their sheer size and overwhelming market share.
    This strength has in the past made it possible for the
brokerages to calm down markets under guidance from the Finance
Ministry, analysts said.
    But the analysts questioned whether the brokerages, which
have already suffered heavy losses from falling bond markets
over the past year, would have the strength this time to turn
things around.
    "The question is, are the Japanese brokerages strong enough
to force investors to buy," said Johsen Takahashi, research
director at the Mitsubishi Research Institute.
    "If we consider that they have suffered serious losses in
the bond markets and in their U.S. Investments, it is debatable
whether they they could support buying," he said.
    "We can support things to some extent, but we can't
completely suppress selling," said one Japanese broker.
    Some analysts said the high percentage of shares cross-held
by financial institutions and other corporations could have a
stabilising effect on the market.
    Some 80 pct of shares are held by corporate shareholders,
said Keikichi Honda, general manager of the Bank of Tokyo Ltd's
economic research division. "This is a tightly woven textile. In
its own way it is stronger than Wall Street."
    But other analysts expressed doubt about this argument.
    "If a high percent of shares is cross held, everything
happens at the edges and the relative moves can be larger," said
Kleinwort Benson Ltd financial analyst Simon Smithson. "Selling
will drive prices down an enormous distance because of no
liquidity."
    "You don't need big volume to get big declines in the market
-- you just need a huge imbalance between sellers and buyers,"
said Barclay's Morgan.
    Shares held by what are termed "stable shareholders," or
banks and other companies with which a firm does business,
might also find their way onto the market if the outlook gets
bad enough, some analsyst said.
    "Closely held shares could become unclosely held," said
Morgan. But he said such a prospect is unlikely right now
because companies, with their improved earnings prospects, do
not need to sell shares for cash flow reasons.

Rises in West German and international
interest rates are a cause for concern and the Bundesbank has
no interest in higher capital market rates, Bundesbank

Poehl told an investment conference.

in higher capital market rates," he said.
    Shortly after Poehl spoke, the Bundesbank announced a
tender for a securities repurchase pact at a fixed rate of 3.80
pct.
    Previous tenders over the last month by interest rate have
seen the allocation rate on these facilities rise to 3.85 pct

    The Bundesbank's reduction of the key allocation rate to
3.80 from 3.85 pct was heralded Monday by repeated injections
of money market liquidity at between 3.70 and 3.80 pct.
    These moves to cap interest rates followed a meeting
between Poehl, Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and U.S.
Treasury Secretary James Baker Monday in Frankfurt.
    Officials said afterwards the three men had reaffirmed
their commitment to the Louvre accord on currency stability.
    Over the weekend, criticism by Baker of the tightening in
West German monetary policy had prompted a sharp fall of the
dollar on speculation that Louvre cooperation had ended.
    But the dollar rallied on news of Monday's meeting in
nervous trading to trade above 1.79 marks Tuesday.
    Poehl said that the recent rise in interest rates was not
due to central bank policy, but to markets' expectations, and
currency developments.
    Commenting on the inflationary expectations, Poehl said "You
have to get to the root of the problem, you have to pursue a
policy which reveals that there are no grounds for such fears."
 The inflationary fears were unjustified and exaggerated, he
said.
    Poehl rebuffed recent U.S. Criticism of West Germany,
saying the Bundesbank had made a substantial contribution to
international cooperation in interest and monetary policy.
    The Bundesbank has tolerated an overshooting of its money
supply target, arousing criticism from other quarters, he said.
    "Today we still have lower interest rates than at the end of
1986... Quite the contrary of other countries, where interest
rates have risen substantially more," Poehl said.
    This had to be taken into account when considering recent
rises in repurchase pact allocation rates, which were due to
rising international money market rates that had spilled over
into the German market, he said.
    Poehl expressed surprise that financial markets had so far
ignored improvements in the U.S. Deficits.
    "The adjustment process in the U.S. Trade balance is
definitely underway," he said, noting that this was not so
noticeable in absolute figures.
    The spectacular improvement in the budget deficit had also
attracted little attention, he said.

U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
Lawson said the Government was going ahead with this month's
flotation of British Petroleum Co Plc <BP.L> shares despite the
collapse on international stock markets.
    "We are going ahead because the whole issue has been
underwritten - we had it underwritten because there is always a
risk of this sort of thing happening," Lawson said in a BBC
radio interview.
    Lawson's remarks came as renewed selling on the London
stock market took BP shares down a further 33p to 283, well
below the 330p price set for the around seven billion stg
issue.
    Lawson said the U.K. Economy is fundamentally sound and
added that stock markets had reflected that recently.
    "I profoundly believe in the market system as the best way
for securing economic prosperity (but) that does not mean to
say the markets are infallible."
    "My advice to small investors...Is to remain calm. There is
absolutely no reason not to do so," Lawson said.

The Japanese economy is firmly on the
recovery path, supported by robust domestic demand, the Bank of
Japan said in a regular monthly report.
    The report said industrial production is strengthening as
manufacturing companies have almost completed adjustments of
their plant and equipment investment while non-manufacturing
firms have continued to be positive in their capital spending.
    Strong domestic demand, such as consumer spending and
housing investment, will more than offset declining exports,
the central bank report said. It also noted the continued rise
in domestic wholesale prices and money supply.

Plunging Tokyo stock prices will prevent
the Bank of Japan from raising its discount rate and could even
force it to ease monetary policy if the collapse continues,
government and private economists said.
    A rise in interest rates now would only serve to spark
further selling of shares that could ultimately have a major
deflationary impact on the real economy, they said.
    Although Bank of Japan officials have consistently
maintained that they had no plans to raise the 2.5 pct discount
rate, many in the markets have thought otherwise. 
    Fears of a rise in the discount rate were fanned by the
central bank's apparent decision last week to countenance
higher rates on commercial bills, dealers said.
    But today's stock market collapse -- prices fell nearly 15
pct -- means that the Bank of Japan would be hard pressed to
raise the discount rate now, despite its concerns about a
renewed outbreak of inflation, dealers and economists said.
    Japanese government bond prices rose sharply today as the
markets concluded that the stock market's collapse precluded
the central bank from carrying out the widely-rumoured discount
rate increase.
    A senior government economist suggested that both the U.S.
And Japan needed to ease monetary policy now to prevent a
further drop in New York and Tokyo stock prices. "They need to
support the stock and security markets," he said.
    But Bank of Japan officials said they saw no need to change
policy for the moment, although one admitted that the central
bank may have to rethink its strategy if Tokyo stock prices
continue to plunge during the rest of the week.
    Both government and Bank of Japan economists agreed the
economy is better placed now to cope with the deflationary
impact of plunging stock prices than it was a few months ago.
    With the economy recovering strongly, the steep drop in
stock prices is not likely to put a major dent in consumer and
business confidence, one government economist said.
    "There will be some impact on the real economy, but it won't
be that big," said another.
    Individuals are not heavily invested in stocks on their
own, although they do participate through trust funds and other
investment vehicles. And while many manufacturing firms turned
to financial market investments for profits during last year's
economic downturn, the recent rebound has allowed them to
refocus their attention on their core businesses, he said.
    Paradoxically, it is the pick-up in the economy that is
partly to blame for the stock market collapse as companies have
shifted funds away from financial investments to increase
inventories and step up capital spending, one government
economist said.
    In deciding what response to make to the steep stock price
drop, the Bank of Japan must first determine whether prices
will continue to fall further and then decide if they pose a
greater economic danger than the threat of higher inflation,
one central bank official said. "That will at least take a
couple of days, if not weeks," he said.

    Trading on the Hong Kong market has been called off until
Monday because of the steep slide on Wall Street amid panic
selling on all the world's stock exchanges.

    The Stock Exchange said although the Stock Exchange
Automated Quotation (SEAQ) system was working perfectly, "fast

    A "fast market" indicator is displayed at the bottom of the
SEAQ screen when the huge volume of activity is delaying prices
from entering the system, making screen prices lag behind the
prevailing market.
    Such conditions are reviewed every 30 minutes and at 1000

Former Finance Minister Noboru Takeshita,
chosen on Monday to be Japan's next prime minister, will face a
tough test in managing Japan's economy from the very start of
his two-year term, economists and businessmen said.
    Takeshita told a news conference on Tuesday that he would
do his best to continue the domestic reforms and external
policies of Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone.
    However, leading Japanese businessmen called on Takeshita
to outdo Nakasone by showing stronger leadership.
    "Takeshita should not merely follow the Nakasone policies
but should cope with mounting economic issues with a new vision
and policies," Takashi Ishihara, chairman of the Japan Committee
for Economic Development, said in a statement.
    Economists generally agreed that there will be no major
changes in Japan's economic policies under a new leader.
    However, expectations are high among major industries for
new initiatives by Takeshita for immediate and effective
measures to solve economic problems such as trade friction with
the U.S., Administrative and tax reforms, and soaring land
prices.
    Eishiro Saito, chairman of the Federation of Economic
Organisations (Keidanren), urged Takeshita to succeed in
unifying the ruling Liberal Democratic Party as soon as
possible to tackle difficult tasks.
    Regarding foreign economic polices, Yoshitoki Chino,
chairman of the Japan Securities Dealers Association, said
Takeshita should come up with economic measures well before
economic issues develop into problems.
    Behind those calls on Takeshita for prompt action are
doubts about his capability in handling international issues
due to his lack of experience in diplomacy, economists said.
     Economists said foreign countries should be patient with
Takeshita, who is widely known as an ultra-cautious politician.
    Takeshita has repeatedly said, "There should be consensus
before taking action."
    Takeshita has so far failed to unveil specific measures to
reduce Japan's huge trade surplus, economists said.
    He has said Japan will continue to stimulate the economy
and to open the market wider to foreign products.

    Referring to news reports, White House spokesman Marlin

Chemical Bank and Marine Midland Banks
Inc said they are cutting their prime lending rate to 9-1/4 pct
from 9-3/4 pct, reversing an increase that they announced just
last week.
    The reduction is effective immediately.
    No other major U.S. bank had followed the lead of Chemical
and Marine Midland, preferring to keep their prime rates at
9-1/4 pct while they waited to see what course money market
rates would take.
    Following Monday's record fall in Wall Street stock prices,
money market rates fell sharply on Tuesday as investors
ploughed proceeds into short-term instruments and the Federal
Reserve said it is prepared to provide liquidity to support the
economy and the financial system.
    Eurodollar deposit rates in London fell by as much as 9/16
percentage point, Treasury bill rates fell by as much as half a
point (after falling between 59 and 84 basis points on Monday),
and the Fed funds rate dropped to 7-1/4 pct from Monday's
average of 7.61 pct. Speculation even surfaced of a discount
rate cut to calm the markets, dealers said.

Shearson Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc
said the recent decline in equities has had a dislocating
effect on the market but no impact on the company's financial
condition.
    The company reported a drop in third quarter profits to 51
mln dlrs from 65 mln dlrs on increased revenues of 1.3 billion
dlrs compared to 1.1 billion a year earlier.
    "While the decline in equities in recent weeks has had a
dislocating effect on the market in general," Chairman Peter A.
Cohen said, "it has not had an impact on our financial
condition."
   
    Cohen said Shearson's third quarter earnings reflected the
diversity of its revenues and "progress in several core
businesses resulting in higher commission, investment banking
and investment advisory revenues. These improvements were
offset by a decline in revenues from market making and
principle transactions and an increase in expenses from year
ago levels," it said.

A voluntary compliance system for
monitoring U.S. coffee imports under quotas is viewed
skeptically by many in the coffee industry, said analysts and
trade sources.
    "Many sectors of the trade, including large roasters and 
importers, are adamant against voluntary compliance because of
the past, which was subject to tremendous irregularities as it
became a matter of the trade monitoring each other," one
analyst said.
    On Monday, a National Coffee Association newsletter said
the Office of U.S. Trade Representative will implement a
voluntary compliance system temporarily because legislation to
monitor imports is tied up in the Congressional trade bill.
    Under the arrangement, milar to one in 1980, coffee
importers would voluntarily present needed documents to the
U.S. government until Congress approves the monitoring
authority, but if coffee arrives without valid certification,
it will still be allowed entry.
    While many believe producers will not seek to add to the
overburdened stock situation in the U.S., others believe some
will ship outside of the quota requirements in lieu of
monitoring controls, trade sources said.
    "Last time, there was a lot of false information submitted
to customs which resulted in a lot of indictments and fines," a
U.S. Customs spokesman said.
    "Customs can do a good job when given the tools, but when
its hands are tied, it doesn't have the authority to demand
Form O (documents tracking merchandise from source to
destination)," he said.
    Many see it as a true test of whether producers and
importers will abide by the quota system.
    "It is a key to seeing whether there are any teeth in the
quota agreement," said one major U.S. roaster.
     "Last time we had a gentleman's agreement, the trade did
not act as a gentleman," said another analyst adding, "without
the need to submit documents, the ball will be in the
producers' hands."
    Some feel that importers will take advantage of the
voluntary compliance due to development of a two-tier market,
in which non-member countries buy coffee at a big discount.
Many fear that dealers will buy coffee destined for non-member
countries at discounts and then bring it into the U.S. falsely
labelled.
    According to customs officials, several green coffee
importers confessed in 1985 that they had imported coffee
fraudulently after buying it for non-member destinations,
forging landing certificates and then relabelling it as navy
beans.
    "If there's that much of a discrepancy between prices for
one country and another, producers may be teted to get rid of
their stocks of coffee by selling to non-member nations and by
circumventing the quota provisions," said Paine Webber analyst
Bernie Savaiko.
    Still, others believe that producers will not be hard
pressed to aggravate the overburdened coffee stock situation in
the U.S. in the near term.
    "It would be naive to suggest that any agreement would not
have some share of connivance, but I think the voluntary system
seemed to suffice and, coupled with the fact that we have so
much coffee, I don't think that it poses that much of a
threat," one trader said.

The White House said the federal
budget deficit for fiscal 1988 will total 163 billion dlrs if
Congress and the administration fail to agree on a legislative
package of deficit reduction measures prior to a Nov. 20
deadline.
    In a report issued under the requirements of new balanced
budget legislation approved by Congress in September, the White
House budget office predicted the government would take in 903
billion dlrs in revenues and spend 1.066 trillion during fiscal
1988, which began Oct. 1.
    Under the terms of the new law, the government's failure to
agree on a deficit reduction package by Nov. 20 would trigger
across-the-board spending cuts of 23 billion dlrs.
    The White House report said this would reduce those defense
spending programs covered by the legislation by 10.5 pct and
would cut domestic programs by 8.5 pct.
    This magnitude of reductions would shear 11.5 billion dlrs
from defense and 11.5 billion dlrs from domestic programs.
    The Congressional budget Office last week estimated the
1988 budget deficit at 179.3 billion dlrs.

Oilmeal demand remained strong in the
United States in July and August and six pct up on levels seen
in the same months last year, with most of the rise coming in
soymeal, the Hamburg based publication Oil World said.
    Total U.S domestic usage of the nine major oilmeals rose to
a record 19 mln tonnes in October 1986/August 1987, up 4.2 pct
on the same year-ago period, with the increase in soymeal at
seven pct, it said.
    Soviet soymeal demand rose by 310,000 tonnes in July and
330,000 tonnes in August over the respective year-ago months
following a huge increase in soymeal imports.
    Oil World presumed some imports were not used immediately
but went into stocks. With imports again large in September, it
estimated Soviet soymeal stocks sharply up at 800,000 tonnes by
October 1 from around 130,000 at the same time last year.
    EC oilmeal demand rose 100,000 tonnes in August from a year
earlier, with soymeal up 45,000 tonnes. Crushings of rapeseed,
sunseed and soybeans will probably rise from last year due to
bumper EC crops. It estimated the EC rapeseed crop at a record
5.9 mln tonnes, up from 3.7 mln last year. Rapeseed disposals
were reported at 2.1 mln tonnes by September 20 against 1.4 mln
at that time last year.

Corrections Corp of America said
it has been selected to negotiate a contract with the Texas

total capital investment of about 27 mln dlrs to be financed
with debt and equity.
    Based on its proposal, the company said, the facilities
would generate annual revenues of about 11 mln dlrs.
    According to Texas law, Corrections said, any private

Crazy Eddie Inc said its board of
directors amended the company's shareholder rights plan in
moves it said were designed to preserve stockholder protection
and provide flexibility to the plan.
    Yesterday, Crazy Eddie agreed not to oppose a slate of
candidates to its board proposed by the Committee to Restore
Stockholder Value, a shareholder group led by the
<Oppenheimer-Palmieri Fund L.P.> and Entertainment Marketing
Inc <EM>, that has been seeking to oust current management.
    Crazy Eddie said the new amendments limit future amendments
to the plan, modify the definition of "continuing directors"
and permit amendment or termination of the plan with the
consent of the company's shareholders if there are no
continuing directors in office or the approval of at least
three such directors cannot be obtained.
    The company also said it approved a certificate of
designation with respect to its 4.5 mln shares of authorized,
but previously undesignated and unissued shares of preferred
stock and adopted an employee stock ownership plan.
    Crazy Eddie also that it requested that the shareholder
group make a commitment not to take the company private until
Crazy Eddie has had a chance to recover from current financial
difficulties, a committment that the group rejected.
    Crazy Eddie said it will hold its annual shareholders
meeting on November 6.

An unexpectedly heavy 4.4 billion stg
surge in U.K. September sterling bank lending is unlikely to
nudge the Bank of England towards tightening monetary policy as
long as sterling remains in its present robust state,
economists said.
    An acute crisis of confidence in equity markets over the
past two days will in any case subdue personal consumer credit
demand which has largely been behind growth in lending.
    "In the normal course of events the markets would have been
extremely worried about that figure," noted Peter Spencer, U.K.
Economist with Credit Suisse First Boston.
    After an initial dip in reaction to the bank lending data,
which compared won stg August rise, U.K.
Government bonds (gilts) soared as investors continued to flee
from plummetting equities into the relative security of
government securities.
    Equity markets dropped sharply on the news, touching a
day's low of 1,766.7 on the FTSE 100 index after the data,
before staging a recovery. Sterling held its buoyant tone
throughout.
    U.K. Money market rates, in a similarly calm response,
resumed the slightly easier trend of earlier in the morning
after little more than a token blip as the figures came out.
    Noting that such a huge rise in credit extended by banks
would under other circumstances have prompted market fears of a
rise in clearing bank base rates from the current 10 pct, "With
the financial markets doing what they're doing, that's the last
thing the Bank of England would want to do," Spencer said.
    "The monetary situation is clearly very bad but as long as
sterling is firm, the authorities are unlikely to put rates up,"
said Kevin Boakes, chief U.K. Economist at Greenwell Montagu
Gilt Edged. Boakes pointed to a rise in the narrow money
measure M0 to 5.2 pct year-on-year from August's 4.5 pct
growth, which he said must cause some concern at the Treasury.
    But "The fact that overall broad money growth has slowed
down is a rather encouraging sign," noted Paul Temperton, U.K.
Economist with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. He pointed to a
fall in the year-on-year growth rate of the M3 broad money
aggregate to 19.5 pct in September from August's 22 pct.
    It was concern about credit growth which prompted the Bank
of England to engineer a one point rise in U.K. Bank base rates
to 10 pct in early August, caution endorsed subsequently by
news of a massive 4.9 billion stg July rise in bank lending.
    Temperton noted that a particular focus of bank worry in
that period had been the behaviour of U.K. Asset markets.
    Housing and equities were the key two asset markets in
influencing consumer behaviour, he said.
    In the light of the precipitous falls on U.K. Equity
markets in the past few days, "There will almost certainly be a
straightforward impact on consumer spending and on retail
sales," Temperton said.
    "Almost certainly we can look forward to slower growth in
consumer borrowing if the equity shakeout continues," he added.
    "I think the stock market has decided that the bank lending
figure is a thing of the past...We are talking about a very
serious panic and a flight to quality," Spencer said.
    A U.K. Treasury official said that it was important to look
at all the monetary information, not just the bank lending,
adding that monetary aggregates were growing much more slowly
than bank lending.
    Senior banking sources noted that the surge in bank lending
was evidence of the continuing recent trend of fairly heavy
personal sector borrowing.
    Figures from the Banking Information Service showed
personal sector lending by U.K. Clearing banks rose by 1.66
billion stg in September after a 978 mln stg August rise. Much
of the rise reflected quarterly interest payments.

Tribune Co said a pre-tax charge of 16.7
mln dlrs or 11 cts a share in employee severance costs at the
New York Daily News led to a 73 pct decline in the company's
1987 third-quarter earnings.
    Tribune reported net income of 33,085,000 dlrs or 42 cts a
share, down from 123,450,000 dlrs or 1.53 dlrs in the 1986
third quarter.
    The company also said its 1986 third-quarter results were
boosted by a one-time pre-tax gain of 145 mln dlrs or 1.11 dlrs
a share from sale of its cable television systems.
    After adjusting for these extraordinary items, Tribune
President Stanton Cook said 1987 year-end should be strong.
    "Overall, we expect Tribune company's earnings before
non-recurring factors to show solid improvement for 1987," Cook
said.
    A 14 pct increase in newsprint prices since the 1986 third
quarter depressed newspaper publishing operating profits, the
company said. They were up only slightly at 46.1 mln dlrs after

Toyota Motor Co expects its U.S. vehicle

    Jim Perkins, group vice president for sales and marketing
for Toyota's U.S. sales subsidiary, told reporters Toyota's
expected decline will come principally in the truck segment
where the company faces intense competition from U.S. domestic
manufacturers such as Ford Motor Co <F>.
    Toyota, he said, also expects to stress sales in the low
and middle segments of the car market to remain competitive.
    Asked if Toyota's U.S. profits could show a substantial
decline with its lower trucks sales in the next two years, he
responded "conceivably it could," but added, "Our plan is not
to chase this thing to where it makes no economic sense."
    Perkins also predicted that the 1988 U.S. vehicle market
could fall below 15 mln sales from above 15 mln expected this
year. He expects some smaller Japanese automakers could be
forced to withdraw from the U.S. market or to seek partnerships
with one another in the face of intense competition.
     The Toyota executive said the collapse of U.S. stock
prices and any further weakening of the dollar would likely
have "a very quick impact on the Japanese (car) companies."
    "In our company, when the stock market goes down, we see it
very soon in the New York metropolitan car market. New York is
the best indicator of what's going to happen in the rest of of
the country. I can tell you from the next 15 days (of car
sales) in the New York market what it will be in the rest of
the country in the next six months," Perkins said.
     The Toyota executive said the panic selloff in the New
York Stock Exchange hurts the car market because "it does
create a shock wave of doubt in the minds of consumers."
     He said Toyota would wait at least 30 to 60 days to assess
the impact of the the stock market drop on the wider economy
before making any changes in its basic business plan for the
U.S. market.
    Toyota, he said, expects its 1988 U.S. sales will total at
least 600,000 cars and 275,000 trucks compared with about
630,000 cars and 300,000 trucks expected for 1987, and 644,000
cars and 388,000 trucks sold in 1986.
    He said Toyota hopes it will be able to import 610,000 cars
from Japan in 1988, the same as its 1987 allocation under
Tokyo's voluntary export restraint scheme.
    But he said it was uncertain if Toyota would keep its
current allocation becuase of pressures on Japan's Ministry of
International Trade and Industry to roll back Japanese car
export quotas from the current 2.3 mln annualized rate.

Donald Regan, President Reagan's
former chief of staff, said the government should loosen the
money supply, try to keep interest rates down and try to reduce
the federal budget and trade deficits to avoid a recession.
    "I think what we have to face now is trying to preserve our
economy," the one-time chairman of Merrill Lynch and Co Inc
<MER> said in an interview on the ABC television network.
    "We've got to loosen money, we've got to keep interest rates
down. We can't afford to let them go up. That means we're going
to have to work on our twin deficits, both the budget deficit
and the trade deficit," Regan said.
     "I certainly wouldn't tighten money at this particular
moment," Regan said when asked about the prospects for a
recession following Monday's price drop on Wall Street.
    "I think that if they were to do that, they'd create the
same conditions that we did in '29...They choked off the money
supply and what happened? We went into a major recession. I
think that's the one thing we've got to avoid right now."
    Regan also called on the government to impose restrictions
on program trading. "I think that that's exacerbated,
exaggerated this decline, and I think it's something that they
must stop," he said.

The Canadian unit of General Motors Corp
and the union representing its 40,000 workers remain far apart
over local issues in contract talks two days from a threatened
strike, a union spokesman said.
    The deepest divisions appeared to be between General Motors
of Canada Ltd and the Canadian Auto Workers local representing
17,000 workers at an assembly plant in Oshawa, Ontario, union
spokesman Wendy Cuthbertson said.
    "Local 222 is miles apart," said Cuthbertson. The local
assembles full-size pick-up trucks, the Buick Regal and the
Pontiac 6000.
    Local issues there included shift schedules, transfers and
working conditions, union president Bob White said.
    The union has threatened to strike at 1000 hrs EDT (1400
gmt) on Thursday unless it has reached a tentative settlement
with the automaker by then.
    Bargaining was scheduled to continue late into the night
Tuesday in an effort to avert a walkout, said Cuthbertson.
    On Monday, the union accepted an economic offer from GM
Canada that largely matched the pay-and-benefit pattern reached
earlier at Chrysler and Ford in Canada.

    Seidman said he believes the economy will remain strong as
long as interest rates remain stable.
    He said the Federal Reserve Board's announcement that it
stood ready to provide liquidity to the financial system was an
effort to reassure markets.
    "In 1929, they did not provide it (liquidity) and now they
are reassuring people that that will not happen again. I fully
support it," he said.
    He said that the stock market decline was not an argument
against allowing banks to underwrite securities because the
stock market is expected to fluctuate.

Monday's international
share crash was exaggerated and did not reflect economic
fundamentals, Wolfgang Roeller, president of the West German
banking association BDB said in a statement.
    "A comparison with the (Wall Street crash of) 1929 is
totally inappropriate," Roeller, also chief executive of
Dresdner Bank AG, said.
    The world economy was growing and dangers of inflation were
being held in check. The recent International Monetary Fund and
World meetings confirmed the positive forecasts for global
economic development.
    Therefore, there were no rational reasons for a sharp
tightening of monetary policy nor for a continued rise in
interest rates, Roeller said.
    "This applies in particular to West Germany," he said.
    As a result, Roeller expected the markets to calm. They
would not ignore long-term economic factors.
    International cooperation on currencies established by the
Louvre accord and strengthened by Monday's meeting between U.S.
Treasury Secretary James Baker, West German Finance Minister
Gerhard Stoltenberg and Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl,
would stand the test, he added.

Britain's highest court has decided the
International Tin Council (ITC) can appeal over the use of ITC
documents in court actions.
    On November 2 the House of Lords will decide if and to what
extent ITC documents, whether circulated or not, are admissible
as court evidence. Lawyers working in the legal tangle left
from the October 1985 collapse of the tin market said this
hearing is likely to last a few days.
    On Wednesday the Court of Appeal will link the outstanding
ITC cases that have so far reached it and a single set of
hearings could begin in early January, they added.
    The House of Lords ruling on the use of ITC documents will
be referred back to the action by two Shearson Lehman companies
against the London Metal Exchange although the underlying case
is not expected to be resumed until mid-1988.
    The Court of Appeal hearings include action between brokers
and cases by brokers and banks against the ITC and the member
governments of the tin council.
    Action taken by brokers seeking both the winding up of the
ITC or and placing it into receivership will also be covered by

H.F. Ahmanson and Co, parent of Home
Savings of America, said its third quarter earnings declined as
a result of its decision in the second quarter to curtail sales
of loans and mortgage-backed securities.
    As a result, after-tax gains on sales of loans and
mortgage-backed securities accounted for 28 pct of its third
quarter net, compared to 82 pct in last year's third quarter.
    The company reported third quarter income of 40.3 mln dlrs,
or 41 cts per share, down from 78.9 mln dlrs, or 80 cts per
share, a year ago.
   
    The company said third qurter loan sales totaled 366 mln
dlrs, inlcuding 290 mln dlrs of adjustable rate mortgage
instruments, generating after-tax gains of 11.2 mln dlrs. This
compares with year ago loan sales of 2.29 billion dlrs,
generating after-tax gains of 65.1 mln dlrs.
    Third quarter loan originations totaled a record 3.48
billion dlrs, up 29 pct frrm 2.69 billion dlrs a year ago,
reflecting record loan fundings and the reduced loan sales.
    Ahmanson said monthly adjustable rate loans accounted for
85.8 pct of the real estate loans and mortgage-backed
securities, up from 77.6 pct a year ago.

    In an effort to reduce the volatility in the market today,
the NYSE temporarily suspended trading on the New York Futures

    The NYSE said the reason for the suspension was that they

Texaco Inc chairman Alfred DeCrane said
the company anticipates that the Texas State Supreme Court will
agree to hear its 10.3 billion dlr legal battle with Pennzoil
Co <PZL> over ownership of Getty Oil.
    "We expect that the Texas Supreme Court will hear our case,
will heed the voices of impartial third parties and will
ultimately reverse this unjust decision and thus provide the
simple basic justice that Texaco has asked for all along,"
DeCrane said in a speech at a meeting of the International
Association of Drilling Contractors.
    DeCrane said he expected the Texas State Supreme Court to
overturn a State Appeals Court ruling that found Texaco
unlawfully interfered with Pennzoil's 1984 plan to acquire
Getty Oil.
    "This case has become much more than a quarrel between two
companies," DeCrane said. "It presents a far broader threat to
our economic system and to justice in America as we know it
today."
   
    Settlement talks between the two oil companies to resolve
the billion dlr lawsuit reportedly stalled earlier this year
when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed a friend
of the court brief in support of Texaco.
    The agency claimed Pennzoil violated SEC rule 10B-13 which
prohibits the purchase of shares privately at the same time a
tender offer is outstanding.
    DeCrane also said concerns expressed by 19 state attorneys
general in the legal proceedings also favored Texaco's
position.
    "The bottom line is that the SEC had intervened to insure
that its rule are interpreted properly in the interest of
millions of private stockholders around the country who might
some day find themselves the victim of this same kind of
manipulation," DeCrane told the oilmen.
    He warned that if the state appeals court judgment was
upheld in Pennzoil's favor, it would "send out of state
businesses fleeing from Texas in droves."
    Texaco filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S.
bankruptcy code last April after a state appeals court upheld
Pennzoil's 10.3 billion dlr judgment.
   
    Texaco's appeal of the decision to the Texas State Supreme
Court has been pending for several weeks and the court is
expected to decide soon whether it will agree to review the
lower court ruling.
    If the Texas State Supreme Court does not hear the case,
Texaco has said it will take its case to the U.S. Supreme
Court.

Manufacturers Hanover Corp said it
earned 129.1 mln dlrs for the third quarter, up from 105.8 mln
a year earlier.
    Net income per common share rose to 2.73 dlrs from 2.29
dlrs.
    Manufacturers Hanover said it raised common shareholders'
equity at the end of the third quarter from the second quarter
by 347 mln dlrs, to 2.09 billion dlrs. Included in the increase
was 267 mln dlrs from the sale last month of 6.9 mln new shares
of the corporation's common stock, and 76 mln dlrs from
retained earnings.
   
    Primary capital grew to 6.2 billion dlrs, or 7.92 pct of
total assets, up from 5.3 billion dlrs, or 7.07 pct, a year
earlier.
    Provisions for possible loans losses in the third quarter
was 111.9 mln dlrs, down from 139.5 mln a year ago. The reserve
for loan losses stood at 4.78 pct of total loans at the end of
September, up from 1.72 pct a year earlier.
    "We have placed top priority on the restoration of
shareholders' equity in the shortest time frame possible," said
John McGillicuddy, chairman and chief executive.
    "The first step was selling the full amount of new common
equity we anticipate needing in this replenishment process,"
McGillicuddy added. "The remainder will come from higher core
earnings, the sale of undervalued, non-strategic assets and the
recognition of tax benefits."
    Taken together, he said, these moves, as well as tighter
control over asset levels, will raise the corporation's common
equity-to-assets ratio to the four-pct range by the end of
1988. The ratio was 2.77 pct on September 30.
    For the nine months, Manufacturers reported a net loss of
1.16 billion dlrs, down from a gain of 301.8 mln a year ago.
    On a per-share basis, the loss was 28.33 dlrs, down from a
gain of 6.42 dlrs.
    The nine-month results reflect the impact of a previously
announced decision last quarter to boost the corporation's
loan-loss reserves by 1.7 billion dlrs. Without the addition,
net income would have been 263.3 mln dlrs, or 5.41 a share.
    Net interest revenue on a taxable equivalent basis in the
third quarter was 494.2 mln dlrs, down from 546.4 mln.
    Non-interest expenses in the latest quarter rose to 571.0
mln dlrs from 541.8 mln. Total capital at September 30 rose to
9.5 billion dlrs from 8.9 billion.

    It said county commissions ratified the contract which
calls for investment of 45 mln dlrs to refurbish the plant and
restore it to its original capacity of 920,000 tons of solid
waste per year.
   
    Montenay said the agreement allows Dade County to maintain
its disposal fee at 27 dlrs per ton, by far the lowest of all
counties involved in resource recovery in Florida.
    The company said it will receive 22 dlrs per ton of refuse

county and retain revenues from the sale of ash, minerals and

Many Florida investors are old enough to
have seen it all before -- they lived through the Crash of '29
and Monday's stock market debacle was just another day for
some.
    "I don't sell," declared one elderly investor, who said he
had more than one mln dlrs in stocks. "Whatever goes down is
bound to come back up."
    The uniqueness of south Florida investors was easy to see
in brokerage offices around Miami, where the average age of the
crowds watching the Big Board quotations flash by on Tuesday
was retirement and beyond.
   
    "I don't know of any demographic studies, but we certainly
have the highest number of elderly active investors," said
Marshall Moore, a vice president of AmeriFirst Securities
Corporation in Miami.
    He worries that Monday's record loss of more than 500
points on the New York Stock Exchange will scare many people,
particularly those on fixed incomes, out of the market forever.
    "They will not be in stocks any longer," he said. "When you
start getting heart palpitations and sweaty palms you have to
get out and stay out except for maybe utilities and some
income-oriented issues."
   
    Across the state on the Gulf coast where there are heavy
concentrations of retired persons, Robert Lee of Investment
Management and Research Incorporated said there were "a lot of
serious losses out there."
    Retirees account for 90 per cent of his firm's business and
could take comfort in the fact that its professional managers
took their money out of the market last month. "But for those
who were buying in on the recent  upswing, this is devastating,"
he said.
   
    Miami Beach broker George Fox, most of whose clients are
over 60, worries that many are not taking the situation
seriously enough. Those who depend on their market earnings
should be a lot more concerned, he said. "I am scared because I
think this could become very serious."
    One 93-year-old investor said the market was bound to fall
sharply, "I just didn't think it would happen so soon." She
remembered '29 and said she remained stingy to this day as a
result. "I still find it hard to spend money."

Ford Motor Co Chairman Donald Petersen
still expects slightly more than 15 mln U.S.-made cars and
trucks will be sold domestically in 1987, he told reporters.
    This is down from the 16.1 mln U.S. built vehicles sold
domestically last year, he added.
    Despite the sell-off in world stock markets, Petersen said,
the underlying fundamentals in the private sector of the U.S.
economy remain strong so calendar 1988 vehicle sales should
equal the 1987 total.
   
    Petersen said he could not explain nor predict stock market
activity.
    But he called for government officials to seriously address
long-term problems such as the trade and budget deficits,
stating the dollar is still too strong relative to other major
currencies.
    For example, he said, the dollar should be about 120 yen
currently instead of its present level just below 144 yen.
   
    Petersen said Ford plans to spend substantially more in the
next five years than the 15.9 billion dlrs spent in the last
five on new products and upgrading of its manufacturing
operations.
    In 1986, Ford spent 3.4 billion dlrs to upgrade vehicle
manufacturing plants, he noted.
    He also said growth in free world car and truck sales will
be 1.8 pct per year over the next 10 years.
    Worldwide over-capacity, which was about 2.7 mln units in
1985, could expand to nine mln units by 1990, with more than
five mln of those units in North America, Petersen said.

    The company said the petition also requests the approval of
a comprehensive services agreement between Resorts and <Trump
Hotel Corp>, which is controlled by Donald J. Trump.
    Under the agreement, Trump Hotel agrees to provide a
comprehensive range of services including marketing,
management, and construction and development to Resorts, the
company said.
    The company said the agreement also provides for the
non-exclusive license to Resorts to use the Trump name and
other trademarkes and service marks in connection with the
operations and marketing of Resorts properties.
    The terms of the agreement call for Trump Hotel to receive
an annual services fee of 1-3/4 pct of Resorts adjusted gross
revenue and 15 pct of its adjusted net income, the company
said. Additionally, Trump Hotel will receive a fee equal to
three pct of the post July 21, 1987 construction costs of the
Taj Mahal, the company said.
    The company said the proposed consolidation and the service
agreement were both unanimously approved by a committee of

Texaco Inc chairman Alfred DeCrane said
the massive stock market correction could affect any out of
court settlement of the company's 10.3 billion dlr legal
dispute with Pennzoil Co <PZL>.
    However, DeCrane refused to say whether the two companies
were holding any settlement negotiations.
    "Certainly the market shakeout might affect the way this is
handled," DeCrane told reporters following a speech at a
meeting of the International Association of Drilling
Contractors.
    "In this environment, cash looks very important."
    DeCrane declined to say whether Texaco and Pennzoil had
held any recent settlement talks, citing a confidentiality
agreement between the two companies.
    "A few months ago Texaco offered 100 mln dlrs cash, no
strings attached just to take this appeal to the Texas Supreme
Court," DeCrane said. He was referring to a non-settlement
proposal that would have eliminated the threat of Pennzoil
filing liens, or ownership rights, against Texaco property
before the company filed for bankruptcy protection in April.
    "I think that (the offer) looks pretty good now to a
Pennzoil shareholder whose stock is trading around 30 or 40."
    Settlement talks between the two companies reportedly broke
down earlier this year after Pennzoil insisted it would not
settle for less than four billion dlrs.
    Since then, Texaco has asked the Texas State Supreme Court
to review the 10.3 billion dlr judgment against it.
    DeCrane also said it was not clear if the stock market drop
could spur further consolidation in the oil patch.
    "We know the value is there. The market fluctuation has not
changed the value of the underlying assets," DeCrane said

Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas
lease sale number 97 in the Beaufort Sea, tentatively
schedualed for January 1988 has been postponed, the U.S.
Department of Interior said.
    Alan Powers, chief of the Minerals Maanagement Service for
the department, said the delay is to have more time to study
the effects of drilling noise on whale migrations.
    Powers said the state has asked for additional noise data
for the sale area off Alaska's North Slope. A new date has not
been set, but it will likely be no sooner than next March,
Powers said.
    Some 3,930 blocks encompassing about 21 mln acres are
involved in the proposed sale. The area is between three and
160 miles off the northern coast of Alaska in the Artic Ocean
between the Canadian border and 162 degrees west longitude.

In a joint statement, Merrill Lynch and

operating officer Daniel tully said that despite the
unprecedented stock market decline, they are confident that an
upturn lies ahead.
    "In the view of our market experts, yesterday's
unprecedented stock market decline was an over-reaction to
fears of higher interest rates, more inflation and a lower
dollar. Indeed, after examining many factors, there is reason
to believe than an upturn lies ahead," the statement said.
    The Merrill Lynch executives also said in the statement
that the fact that bonds rallied, commodities weakened and the
dollar remained relatively firm suggests that the central banks
may now act to provide the system with additional liquidity.
    "While further carry-over selling from yesterday and
worries about a stock decline in Japan may put further pressure
on the market in the near-term, we believe that this central
bank cooperation would provide the fuel for a recovery in stock
prices and a revival of confidence relecting fundamental

The Bank of New York Corp <BK> said it
reaffirmed the terms of its offer for Irving Bank Corp despite
the drop in the Bank of New York's share price to 30-1/8, a
Bank of New York spokesman said.
    "The offer still stands, we have not changed our offer," a
Bank of New York spokesman said.
    Irving would not comment on how the drop in the market
affects its position on the bid or whether it would buy back
any of its own shares.
    Earlier this month, Irving rejected the bid as inadequate
and said it wanted to retain its independence.
    In late September, Bank of New York offered 80 dlrs per
share in cash for 47.4 pct of Irving. For the remaining 52.6
pct, it offered an exchange of 1.9 shares of its shares for one
Irving share.
    At that time, the stock purchase portion was worth close to
80 dlrs per share, but now that portion is worth 53 dlrs per
share for a net price of 68 dlrs, one analyst said.
    According to the prospectus offer, shareholders may tender
for all cash or all shares on a first come, first serve basis.
    Analysts were mixed about how the stock price drop would
affect the acquisition.
    "If it gets to the Irving shareholders, they would approve
it, but Irving hopes the offer won't go to the shareholders,"
said Mark Alpert, banking analyst with Bear Stearns Cos Inc.
    "And the market is saying the deal won't go through,"
Alpert said.
    "The transaction looks highly unlikely to be completed at
present. If Irving wouldn't go with the offer at 80 dlrs a
share, then they won't go at a lower price," another analyst
said.
    The analyst also doubted that Bank of New York could afford
to retain its original offer.
    However, industry sources were more uncertain about
prospects for the deal.
    "With Irving's price so low, Bank of New York's offer will
look good to Irving shareholders," said Michael Flores, a
consultant at Bank Earnings International, a consulting firm.
    The drop of Irving's share to 44 dlrs per share, which is
about a 26 dlr drop from the beginning of last week, increases
the chance that Bank of New York will succeed, Flores said.
    Analysts said that the drop in bank stock prices is likely
to depress the level of mergers and acquisition in the banking
industry.
    "Bank takeovers are less likely because banks can't use
their own stock to make acquisitions because their share price
is too depressed," Alpert said.
    Since only banks can buy another bank, the only other
possible acquirors would be a foreign bank, Alpert said.
    "In the market drop the stock of acquirors got clobbered
more than the acquirees," another analyst said.

New York Stock Exchange chairman John
Phelan said the NYSE will continue to request that member firms
refrain from using its order-delivery systems for program
trading until the record trading volume slows down.
    He said the firms are free to use other systems to do
arbitrage between stock-index futures and their underlying
stocks. "We are going to continue to get volatility for some
time to come," Phelan told a news conference.
    He said program trading adds liquidity to the market but
"at the extreme that adds to the volatility." He said further
analysis of the issue is needed.
    Phelan said a significant number of corporations had begun
buying back their own stock in a move that helped blue chips
gain back some of Monday's losses.
    Asked how the record decline on Monday and the
unprecedented trading volume affected the financial health of
member firms, Phelan said, "As far as we can tell, member firms
are in good shape."
    He said he expects to appear at a Congression hearing in
Washington later this week that will examine the question of
program trading.
   
    Phelan said NYSE officials were in conference with other
financial leaders and White House chief of staff Howard Baker
for much of the day, adding that "the whole system has been
very supportive."
    He said three or four of the NYSE's specialist firms
required and received help with capital. He said these firms
were no longer having capital problems but did not discuss
specific figures. Asked why some stocks were delayed on opening
while others traded, he said the exchange did not want to keep
the vast majority of the 1500 listed companies from trading.

President Reagan said he had ordered
the administration to begin talks with congressional leaders on
a budget deficit reduction plan.
    Reagan said in a statement following a meeting with his top
economic advisers that he was prepared to order across the
board spending cuts to comply with a Federal balanced budget
law, but preferred to negotiate with Congress.
    He said he would consider anything the congressional
leadership proposed, but a spokesman said he remains opposed to
raising taxes as a way to reduce the deficit.
    "I think it is preferable, if possible that the executive
and legislative branches reach a budget deficit reduction
package. Accordingly, I am directing that discussions be
undertaken with the bipartisan leadership of the Congress for
that purpose," Reagan said.
    Asked whether he would consider raising taxes, Reagan said
"I am willing to look at whatever proposal they might have."
    As Reagan boarded the helicopter to visit his wife Nancy at
Bethesda Naval Hospital, he was questioned as to whether that
meant he was softening on his tax stance. Reagan replied "if you
heard that it must have been the helicopter."
    White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater later told reporters
that Reagan was not changing his opposition to tax increases.
Fitzwater said the administration would accept automatic cuts
under the Gramm Rudman balanced budget law rather than raise
taxes.
    Earlier on Tuesday congressional leaders called for an
economic summit with the White House to address the nation's
budget and trade deficits that some analysts say were partly to
blame for the stock market drop.
    Reagan said he would be willing to participate personally
in any negotiations with Congress.
    The White House earlier seemed to reject the idea of
negotiating with Congress on the budget deficit.
    Fitzwater said this morning that the White House continued
to oppose a budget summit with Congress on the grounds that it
would be used by Democrats as a platform to press for a tax
increase.
    But Reagan announced his willingness to negotiate with
Congress after meeting for about an hour with White House Chief
of Staff Howard Baker, Treasury Secretary James Baker, Federal
Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan and chief economic
adviser Beryl Sprinkel.

Pacific Stock Exchange Chairman
Maurice Mann said the exchange may have reached record volume
again today, following yesterday's record 17.6 mln shares.
    it looks like at least the same volume as yesterday, Mann
said at a news conference following the close.
    The exchange closed one-half hour early for the second
straight day. Mann said the exchange will determine daily
whether or not to close early over the next several days.
    Mann said the only major operational problem today occurred
when the exchange had to stop trading 30 over-the-counter
options, 17 of which trading were restored later in the day.
    He said the options had to be halted because price
information on the underlying stocks was not being disseminated
on the floor quickly enough.
    "You cannot trade an option, unless you know how much its
worth," he said.
    Mann said the exchange's computer system was working better
than had been expected under the pressure of the heavy trading
volume.
    "This system was not designed to do what it did today and
yesterday," he said.
    He said technical adjustments to the system since yesterday
improved today's operations. He would not elaborate.
    Mann said the decision to close the exchange early was not
due to concerns over the vulnerability of being open one half
hour after New York closed. Rather, he said, it was to allow
trades to be tallied in conformance with other exchanges.
    In Los Angeles, traders said although trading was hectic,
they were able to keep up with orders better than yesterday.
    "We could handle the orders we got. Things seem to be
smoothing out," said Richard Goforth, a partner with Crowell
Weedon and Co who trades on the Los Angeles exchange floor.
    Goforth, added, however, traders expected to be there into
the evening sorting out the paperwork on their trades.
    Jefferies and Co Director of Trading James Melton said the
firm has been extremely busy making markets in halted stocks
and in after hours trading. He said Jefferies has been trading
about 15 hours a day, beginning at 0300 pdt.
    Melton said Jefferies made markets in such blue chip stocks
as International Business Machines <IBM>, Allegis Corp <AEG>
and Merck and Co <MRK> while they were halted on the exchanges.
    Melton declined to give volumes of off-market trading the
company has been doing, but said, "its just very, very busy...
when the stocks are halted our markets are very active." He
said he expects the heavy volume to continue through the week.
    While sellers still predominated, Melton added, "people
were bottom fishing a little bit in the blue chips...but its
very nervous."

First RepublicBank Corp, the largest bank
holding company in Texas, reported a loss of 6.3 mln dlrs for
the third quarter and said that its non-performing loans rose
sharply because of a further deterioration in Texas's real
estate market.
    There was no comparable figure for the third quarter of
1986 because the company was formed in June 1987 through the
merger of RepublicBank Corp and Interfirst Corp.
    Non-performing loans were 3.1 billion dlrs at the end of
September, or 12.4 pct of total assets, mpared with 9.5 pct
at the end of the second quarter.
    Loans secured by real estate accounted for about 90 pct of
the 706 mln dlr increase in non-performing loans in the third
quarter, First Republicbank said.
    It said the poor shape of the office and retail housing
markets in Dallas, Houston and Austin will continue to hold
back earnings.
    "As indicated earlier in 1987 by First RepublicBank, the
company will continue to assess future common stock dividend
payments relative to earnings performance," Gerald
Fronterhouse, chairman and chief executive officier, said in a
statement.
    First RepublicBank said its third-quarter loan loss
provision of 106 mln dlrs and net charge-offs of 87 mln dlrs
left its total allowance for credit losses at 1.14 billion
dlrs, or 4.6 pct of the loan portfolio.
    The company's primary capital amounted to 7.9 pct of assets
at the end of September.
    The 6.3 mln dlr loss was sustained despite a 29 mln dlr cut
in overhead, achieved partly by staff attrition. The size of
the combined staffs of the two banks has been cut by 12 pct so
far this year, and Fronterhouse said the bank is ahead of the
schedule it set for achieving savings through the merger.

CIP Inc, wholly-owned by Canadian
Pacific Ltd, is considering building a pulp mill in Texas which
would use kenaf fibre instead of wood, CIP president Cecil
Slenniken said in an interview.
     The kenaf plant is a member of the hibiscus family and was
artificially developed several years ago. The plant, which has
been grown in Southern Texas, reaches a height of 10 feet in
three months and is said to produce better quality newsprint
than wood pulp, a CIP official said.
     Slenniken said the company has commissioned studies for a
200,000 tonne capacity pulp mill which would use the fibre but
would need partners to begin the project.
    "We are not yet ready to commit the hundreds of millions of
dollars it would take for such a project," Slenniken said.
     He said CIP has been using the pulp on a trial basis to
make newsprint containing 90 pct kenaf fibre and 10 pct
softwood fibre at its Trois-Rivieres, Quebec plant.
    CIP, Canada's second largest newsprint producer, recently
launched a 366 mln Canadian dlr newsprint mill at Gold River,
British Columbia which is due begin producing 230,000 metric
tonnes per year by fall of 1989.

Former Treasury Secretary William Simon
sharply criticised President Reagan for irresponsible fiscal
policies that contributed to this week's stock price collapse.
    "(Reagan) fell for that siren song that you can cut taxes
without cutting spending and that we would 'grow our way out of
this,' and everything would be wonderful," Simon said, in an
apparent reference to the massive U.S. budget deficit.
    "Every time we hear that nonsense we ought to howl with
pain as we were howling yesterday and are howling today," he
said in an interview taped this afternoon for the MacNeil
Lehrer Newshour which will air at 1930 EDT (2330 GMT).
    Simon, who held his post under presidents Nixon and Ford,
said Reagan's tax cuts are positive for saving and investment.
    And he blamed Congress for causing the U.S.'s fiscal
problems by putting self-interest ahead of national interest.
    "It's not only the president. It's Congress ... under
Republicans and Democrats alike," he said. "They're a bunch of
hypocrites who have one credo -- that credo is 'more.'"

The Commodity Futures Trading
Commission said futures markets collected clearing margins
called following feverish futures trading on Monday.
    "The Commission remains in frequent contact with the
futures markets which trade stock index futures and options,
each of which has confirmed the collection of clearing margins
called for as a consequence of futures trading on Monday,
October 19, 1987," the CFTC said in a statement.
    Four U.S. exchanges briefly halted stock index futures
trading Tuesday, and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) urged
members to refrain from using program trading.
    Acting CFTC Chairman Kalo Hineman said CFTC continued to
"closely monitor the financial integrity of firms with
positions in the stock index futures and options markets."
    A futures industry official said there was some concern
among industry leaders that stock index futures would be blamed
for the stock market's nosedive on Monday.
    "This is an equity market problem," the official said. "Our
(U.S.) budget deficit, (and) what's going on in the Gulf appear
to be much more responsible because they shape what's happening
in futures markets."
    Some lawmakers focused criticism on index arbitrage
trading.
    Republican Senator John Heinz said he recommended to the
White House that daily trading limits be applied to stock index
futures and that index futures margins be raised.

Southland stock during various times in 1987 and the issuance

    Southland did not elaborate on the SEC order of
investigation, and company officials could not be reached for

    The SEC has a long-standing policy against confirming or

The nation's exchanges and brokerage
houses said their computers systems have been strained by the
avalanche of trading triggered by the past week's stock market
collapse.
    And while the financial instry's hi-tech resources have
been able to handle the crisis, the sudden surge in trading
volume will likely force the exchanges and securities firms to
revamp their computer systems and communications networks
several years earlier than they had planned, industry officials
said.
    "We had already started certain processes to increase the
New York Stock Exchange's capacity," said Jim Squyres, a
spokesman for the Securities Industry Automation Corp, which
runs the central computer network for the New York and American
Stock Exchanges.
    "We will have to seriously consider speeding that up," he
said. After three straight days of record volume, however, many
exchanges were pushing their systems to untested limits. And
while the exchanges said their computers were handling the
crush, brokers and traders complained about lost trades and
delayed price quotes.
    The most serious problems arose on Monday, when a record
fall of 508 points in the dow and volume of more than 600 mln
shares on the New york stock exchange stunned the entire
industry.
    The American Stock Exchange's order-routing system crashed
just 10 minutes before trading closed. The Pacific Stock
Exchange suspended business a half-hour early so it could catch
up with a massive backlog of trades.
    And the price-quote feed supplied by the NYSE was cut off
several times during the day, leaving some traders with quotes
that were often 45 minutes behind the actual market.
     Although the computers whirred away late into the night,
the exchanges opened on time Tuesday and problems were fewer,
even though NYSE volume swelled to 610 mln shares. Combined
volume of the NYSE, American and over-the-counter exchanges
topped 900 mln shares.
    "I think we're equipped for this kind of trading," said
Paul Stevens, executive vice president of operations for the
American Stock Exchange.
    "The problem is less the computers, which are handling the
volume, than the strain on people," he said.
   
     "The computers might turn out to be the heroes of this
whole thing," added DuWayne Peterson, executive vice president
of technology at Merrill Lynch and Co Inc.
    In fact, officials said the biggest constraint on trading
was caused by some of the oldest machines on exchange floors,
the card printers that issue the buy and sell orders.
    But even as computer executives spoke with awe about their
systems' ability to hold up under unprecedented pressure, they
started to plan for the future.

     "We had to do a lot of innovative things to handle this
volume," said Squyres of the Securities Industry Automation

TLX Partners, a group led by Asher
Edelman, does not see any problems with its 65 dlr per share
bid for Telex Corp, a Shearson Lehman official advising the
group said.
    Several other takeover proposals have crumbled following
declines in financial markets, leading to speculation that
Edelman might also drop his offer. Telex fell 11 to 34-1/4.
    Earlier today, Carl Icahn dropped his bid to take Trans
World Airlines Inc <TWA> private and Dart Group Corp <DARTA.O>
said it abandoned plans to acquire Dayton Hudson Corp <DH>.
    Both cited market conditions.
    "Nothing fundamental has changed with the company. The
stock price has changed, but the company hasn't changed so
there's no reason for us to change," said Daniel Good, head of
Shearson Lehman merchant banking.
    "Things are proceeding as planned, and we fully expect that
at the time we have to pay for the shares the financing will be
in place," Good said.
    Shearson has agreed to provide bridge financing of up to 
600 mln dlrs for the Edelman group.

Canada will propose at the new round of
international trade talks that most trade-distorting farm
subsidies be phased out over a five year period, Trade Minister
Pat Carney said.
    "Agricultural subsidies and trade barriers have created a
vicious circle which continues to cause problems of
overproduction and low commodity prices," Carney told the House
of Commons.
    Carney was outlining the government's new position on the
farm trade problem that was tabled on Tuesday in Geneva in the
multilateral talks under the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade).
    While few details were released, Carney said the government
would also be pressing for an improvement in market access and
new measures to ensure countries do not erect artificial
barriers.
    "Under the Canadian proposal, all countries would have to
ensure that domestic policies and programs to address the
specific needs of their farm sectors do not distort trade," a
government background paper said.
    "Furthermore, in assessing the trade impact of programs,
credit could be given to countries which effectively control
the output of farm products," the papers said.

Standard and Poor's Corp said it may
downgrade the 100 mln dlrs of B-plus 13-5/8 pct senior
subordinated debentures due 1997 of Bally Health and Tennis
Corp, a unit of Bally Manufacturing Corp.
    S and P cited the parent's proposals to sell Bally Health
for more than 500 mln dlrs to an investor group. It noted the
transaction includes the assumption of Bally Health's debt.
    Although the investor group's plans are not known, the
acquisition will probably be debt financed and markedly
increase Bally Health's financial risk. S and P said the sale
of the unit would increase the parent's financial position.
    In a related action, Standard and Poor's affirmed the debt
ratings of Bally Manufacturing and related entities. Affirmed
were BB first mortgage bonds, BB-minus second mortgage bonds
and B-plus subordinated debt.
    S and P said pro-form debt leverage for Bally
Manufacturing, adjusted to capitalize operating leases, drops
to a still high 68 pct from an aggressive 75.5 pct at June 30.
Adjusted for asset sales, the parent company's return on
capital, 11.6 pct in 1986, should remain subpar, S and P said.

The Bank of Japan reassured a nervous money

conducting a 200 billion yen commercial bill purchase
operation, money traders said.
    The central bank injected funds through three-month
repurchase agreements which mature on January 11 and bear
interest of 3.9375 pct, identical to this morning's rates on
three-month commercial bills.
    The operation was done partly to roll over 300 billion yen
in commercial bills maturing this morning. Money market sources
project a 260 billion yen surplus today.
    In the bond market, the Bank of Japan offered to buy around
50 billion yen of 10-year government bonds, encouraging an

market needed them, especially after Tuesday's plunge in Tokyo

Wall Street's biggest one-day drop since
1914 has revived a bitter debate about whether modern
investment techniques turn shifts in investor psychology into
colossal moves in share prices.
    "The market has gotten away from the players," said Dudley
Eppel, vice president-equity trading at Donaldson Lufkin and
Jenrette Securities Corp. He says stock index futures and
options have distorted the investment process.
    But Wall Street professionals who work with index futures
and options insist the blame is misplaced.
    Fischer Black, head of the trading and arbitrage division
at Goldman, Sachs and Co, says so-called program trading
strategies involving opposite positions in futures on stock
indices and the underlying stocks deserve almost no blame for
today's decline. "People have changed their minds about the
future of the economy," he said. Another strategy, known as
portfolio insurance, may have exagerated the decline to a small
degree, said Black.
    Eli Wachtel of Bear, Stearns and Co was emphatic. "I do not
believe the drop was precipitated by portfolio insurance or
expanded by program trading."
    "The only thing that will stop it in the end is the value
investor who comes in and says 'IBM still sells computers', and
buys for traditional reasons" said Jeffrey Miller of Miller
Tabak Hirsch and Co.
    IBM <IBM> fell 31 to 104 as the Dow Jones Industrial
Average dropped more than 500 points.
    Several years ago Miller's firm was one of the first to
pursue program trading strategies, seeking to lock in an
automatic profit by taking advantage of discrepancies in the
prices of the futures and the underlying stocks. But he said
his firm has not been involved in that since late last year.
    Miller said some investors who were burned in the recent
market declines may have miscalculated the effects of portfolio
insurance. He estimated 70 to 80 billion dlrs in invested funds
prior to the decline were hedged with futures.
    The way portfolio insurance is used, Miller said, investors
at the time they protect their portfolios commit themselves to
a future course of action such as buying a put option. While
negative news such as trade deficits and budget deficits build
for months, the put options tend to be crowded into a narrow
span of time, because they are executed as the market starts to
fall.
    Miller said at present people can only guess how much
portfolio insurance is in use. He suggested some system of
disclosure could put other investors on guard that the seeds
were being planted that might add to a future decline.
    But in any case Miller argued that index futures and
options do not initiate market trends.
    People like Eppel of Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette were
steadfast in their criticism. "If I had my way there wouldn't
be any index futures," he said. "They propelled the market up
when nothing was going on and now we're paying the price."
    Another irate trader, referring to IBM's 31 point drop,
complained "what announcement did IBM make over the weekend
that made its stock drop 31 points?" IBM was as high as 175-7/8
earlier this year.
    Some economists agreed that the stock market could be
sending signals about the economy.  Allen Sinai, chief
economist for Shearson Lehman Brothers, told

Dwindling global crude oil reserves and
the lack of any major new discoveries in recent years will send
the world into an energy crisis by 1990, the former Atlantic
Richfield Co chairman Robert O. Anderson said.
    "It's going to come sooner than anyone thinks," Anderson
told reporters after addressing a Houston business lunch. "I
believe we're going to see a change in the world oil markets in
two to three years because oil is becoming harder to find."
    Anderson, who retired from Arco last year to form Hondo Oil
and Gas Co, said world oil consumption is approaching 60 mln
barrels a day but a current excess capacity cushion of about
4.5 mln barrels a day will rapidly disappear.
    "If you looked around the world, you could not scrape up
one mln barrels a day in shut-in production outside the Middle
East," he said. "We're soon going to be right back where we
were in 1973 and 1979."
    Anderson predicted that world oil prices would end 1987 at
about 24 dlrs a barrel and continue a gradual climb.
    "There's no way prices can stay flat because there isn't
enough supply," he said. "There have been no major oil
discoveries for the past 15 to 20 years."
    Alaska's Prudhoe Bay oil reserves, the last major world
discovery, has already produced about five billion barrels of
oil or more than half of its estimated reserves, he said.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration
has allowed ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc to resume testing its
ribavirin experimental AIDS drug, according to ICN.
    "Our safety concerns are not of sufficient magnitude to
withhold approval of further clinical studies designed to
assess the safety and efficacy of ribavirin," the FDA told ICN
Chairman Milan Panic in an October 16 letter made public by
ICN.
    An FDA spokesman confirmed the authenticity of the letter.
    ICN's tests of the drug on humans were blocked last spring
after the FDA decided there was insufficient evidence of its
effectiveness against two common AIDS-related conditions.
    The tests had been intended to determine whether ribavirin
was effective against AIDS-Related Complex (ARC) and
Lymphadenopathy Syndrome or LAS.
    FDA Commissioner Frank Young disclosed in May, however,
that the agency was investigating "suspicious" test results
submitted by ICN on the antiviral drug. Young said he had
personally scolded ICN officials for making exaggerated claims
about the drug. In addition, a House subcommittee said it was
probing ICN for possible trading or financial irregularities.
    Today, the FDA said it was letting ICN test ribavirin for
safety and effectiveness in 32 patients with ARC and LAS.

The Pacific Stock Exchange closed
half an hour early under a pile of unfilled orders on heavy,
but not record, volume of over 11 mln shares, Exchange
officials said.
    As traders remained on the floors in San Francisco and Los
Angeles, madly trying to balance their accounts long after the
close, Exchange Chairman Maurice Menn told a news conference
trading will, nevertheless, begin on time tomorrow,
at 0630 Pacific Daylight Time.
    Menn told reporters the price of a seat on the exchange
dropped to 86,000 dlrs today from 100,100 dlrs a week ago.
    Menn said the day also saw 134,000 options contracts
traded, compared to a record 202,000 contracts last friday.
    Traders both in Los Angeles and San Francisco said volume
was curbed purely by their inability to fill orders and the
chaos created by the exchange tape falling hours behind, making
it nearly impossible to get accurate price readings.
    "If we would have been able to execute the orders we got,
there would have been 20 mln shares traded," said Richard
Goforth, a partner with Crowell Weedon and Co, who trades on
the Los Angles floor of the Pacific Exchange.
    Traders in San Francisco said there were unconfirmed
reports that one brokerage house alone turned away orders for
50,000 shares they were unable to fill in late trading.
    The traders and exchange officials said action on the
Pacific Exchange did not deviate from that in New York, with
some early buying giving way to panic selling through the
close, which left the Dow Jones Industrial Average down a
record 508 points.
    "We pretty much mirrored what was going on in New York...
they couldn't fill their orders and we knew we couldn't fill
them either," said Goforth.
    While traders said they are bracing themselves for a lower
opening tomorrow, Mann attributed today's dive to panicking
young traders and to monetary policy and said the market should
still recover.
    "It depends on what the politicians do...There's no reason
it cannot go back. This is an abnormality and there is no
justification for this. People are nervous," he said.
    Mann noted he had never seen traders in San Francisco leave
on the floor so long after the close.
    In Los Angeles, one office manager commented early in the
day it was unusual to see traders on their feet.
    "Usually, they're sitting down studying the market, but its
moving so fast they don't have a chance," he said.
    In San Francisco, about 50 people on the sidewalk outside
the jammed lobby of Charles Schwab and Co, strained to see the
discount brokerage house's large ticker display.
    "I can't believe it," mumbled one onlooker.

AMCA International said it expects to

quarter result.
    The company earned 4.9 mln dlrs in the third quarter
against a year earlier loss of 56.2 mln. However, after the
payment of preferred dividends it lost two cents per share from
a loss of 1.79 dlrs per share last year.
    In the 1986 fourth quarter, the company had an operating
loss of 4.9 mln dlrs, or 98 cents per share. It said its
positive outlook was based on expected debt bill reduction and
an improved backlog of orders.
    The company also said its board approved a decision to sell
its Manitoba Rolling Mills. It did not elaborate.

New York Stock Exchange chairman John
Phelan said the stock market underwent a significant correction
today but he did not characterize it as a crash. He also said
the NYSE will open tomorrow on time.
    "The market underwent a significant fall and a significant
devaluation of assets of which we are all concerned," he said.
    Speaking to reporters, Phelan listed several reasons why
the market fell today. He said stocks have been going up for
five years without a correction. He also blamed inflation
fears, rising interest rates, a lower dollar and problems with
Iran. "All came together in a very nervous market" he said.
    "It's the nearest thing to a meltdown that I ever want to
see," Phelan said. Phelan said what he meant by meltdown was a
snowballing effect where selling fed on itself.
    Phelan said the NYSE is going through its standard
procedures before trading begins tomorrow. Those procedures
include checking with member firms on their liquidity, margin
positions, and backlog. "We know of no firm that has a
significant problem, but that could change at any moment," he
said.
    Asked for advice for the average investor, Phelan said, "We
do not know where the market will end up."
    The Dow Jones Industrial average declined a record 508
points to 1738.74. Volume was a record setting 605 mln shares,
almost double the previous record.
    Phelan, in response to a question on declines in foreign
markets, said he believes there is no loss of confidence in the
global economy. He added that the underlying fundamentals of
the U.S. economy are still strong, and that corporate earnings
also continue to be firm.
    Phelan explained today's record descent as being the result
of a confluence of factors, including the globalization of
markets and the proliferation of new securities instruments.
    Those two factors alone have made the market more volatile,
he said.
    Phelan also said a major factor in the decline was the fact
that there has been no major correction in the five-year bull
market. He also pointed to rising tension in the Mideast Gulf.
    The New York Stock Exchange was in constant contact with
the Securities and Exchange Commission about a possible halt in
all trading on the exchange, Phelan said. "The consensus was
that it is better to let the market try to work itself out," he
said.
    In addition, Phelan said that with the global nature of
trading there is no guarantee that halting trading on the New
York Stock Exchange would have served any purpose. Phelan said
he was in contact with the Treasury department, White House and
the Federal Reserve, but that the contact was made as a matter
of routine.

President Reagan is concerned about
the record drop in stock prices but remains convinced on the
basis of administration talks with financial experts that the
economy remains sound, the White House said.
    White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said in a written
statement that Reagan "watched today with concern" the decline on
Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average plunged
more than 500 points.
    The statement said Reagan had directed administration
officials to consult with leading financial experts, including
the chairmen of the Federal Reserve, the Securities and
Exchance Commission, and the New York Stock Exchange.
    "These consultations confirm our view that the underlying
economy remains sound," Fitzwater said.
    The White House statement, issued about 45 minutes after
the stock market closed, appeared designed to calm investors
worried about U.S. economic propects.
    "We are in the longest peacetime expansion in history.
Employment is at the highest level ever. Manufacturing output
is up. The trade deficit, when adjusted for changes in
currencies, is steadily improving. And, as the chairman of the
Federal Reserve Board has recently stated, there is no evidence
of a resurgence of inflation in the United States," Fitzwater
said.
   
    He said Reagan was keeping close watch on the markets in
the United States and in countries, where waves of selling
developed on Monday.
    "We will continue to closely monitor these developments,"
Fitzwater said.
    However, his three-paragraph statement gave no hint of
what, if any, action Reagan might take if the stock market
plunge continues.
    The percentage drop of 22.6 percent on Monday was the
second largest ever, exceeded only by the 24.4 percent drop on
Dec. 12, 1914.
   
    It easily eclipsed the fall of 12.8 percent on Oct. 28,
1929 which helped spark the Great Depression.
    Reagan and his top advisers discussed the market crisis,
which came on the same day American naval forces retaliated for
last Friday's alleged Iranian missile attack on a U.S. flagged
Kuwaiti tanker in the Gulf, at a White House issues luncheon.
    Presidential aides told reporters after the luncheon an
official statement was likely to be issued when the markets
closed.

Standard and Poor's Corp said it
affirmed at 100 mln dlrs of subordinated debt at B-plus and
certificates of deposit at BB/B.
    S and P cited the firm's restructuring which resulted in a
380 mln dlr third quarter loss. The loss was primarily due to
the amortization of 330 mln dlrs of goodwill, the agency said.
It added that amortization does not affect tangible net worth
and is considered a reflection of economic reality.
    Goodwill remains a high part of total equity and capital
levels remain weak. The below-average core profitability should
be enhanced by the firm's business focus, S and P said.

American Telephone and Telegraph Co
said it supported the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC)
plan to establish price ceilings for ATT long-distance services
as a replacement for current regulation.
    The company was responding to an FCC proposal of August 4
that price caps replace the current rate-of-return regulation,
which has been in place for the past 20 years.
   
    ATT said vigorous competition in the long-distance industry
has made obsolete rate-of-return, which stipulates that a
company can earn no more than a fixed rate -- currently 12.2
pct -- on its investment.
    The company termed the price cap a "transitional step," and

J.P. Morgan and Co Inc said
third-quarter net income rose 3.6 pct to 219.2 mln dlrs, from
211.5 mln a year earlier, partly because of reduced loan-loss
provisions and a lower income tax bill.
    For the first nine months of the year, however, Morgan
posted a loss of 140.8 mln dlrs, compared with a profit of
682.4 mln in the same period of 1986, because it set aside 875
mln dlrs in reserves in the second quarter against shaky
third-world loans.
    The provision for loan losses in the quarter was 20 mln
dlrs, down from 70 mln a year earlier.
    Morgan's tax bill was 52.4 mln dlrs in the quarter, down
from 85.3 mln a year earlier, mainly because of benefits
associated with the second-quarter loan-loss provision.
    Net interest earnings fell to 474.3 mln dlrs from 526.5 mln
as net yield narrowed to 2.71 pct from 3.13 pct and 1.3 billion
dlrs of Brazilian loans remained on non-accrual.

    However, "if we don't have local agreements settled by
Thursday, there will be a strike," he said.
    The local issues still unresolved involved health care,
skilled trades and job classifications, White said.

would be avoided.
    "Even though there are some tough issues to be resolved

agreements at Ford <F> and Chrysler <C> in Canada, which
include inflation-indexed payments for future retirees and
fixed annual payments for current retirees.
