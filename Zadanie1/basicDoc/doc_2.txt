The release of U.K. February trade data
showing that the current account surplus was a provisional 376
mln stg, up from a 73 mln surplus in January, has boosted hopes
of an early cut in interest rates, analysts said.
    Market forecasts had been for a worse outcome, with
expectations of a deficit in visible trade averaging about 750
mln stg, against the official figure of 224 mln stg, sharply
narrower than January's 527 mln deficit.
    "The figures are unreservedly good," Chase Manhattan
Securities economist Andrew Wroblewski said.
    Sterling rebounded on the trade figures, reversing a weaker
morning trend, to stand at 72.1 pct of its trade weighted index
against a basket of currencies at midday, unchanged from
yesterday's close but 0.3 points above the 1100 GMT level.
    The market had feared that a deteriorating non-oil trade
pattern would undermine international support for sterling,
which has been the motor behind the recent fall in U.K.
Interest rates. Money market sources said the market had begun
to doubt that a widely expected drop in bank base lending rates
to 9.5 pct from the present 10.0 pct was really on the cards.
    But sentiment now looks to have turned about again.
    There now looks to be no danger that the Chancellor of the
Exchequer Nigel Lawson's forecast of a 1987 current account
deficit of 2.5 billion stg will be exceeded, said Wroblewski.
    Seasonally adjusted figures showed that imports rose in
February to 7.16 billion stg from 6.73 billion in January.
    Exports rose to a record 6.93 billion from 6.20 billion.
    However, Chris Tinker, U.K. Analyst at brokers Phillips and
Drew said that the faster rise in exports than imports would
prove partly aberrational in coming months. He forecast the
Chancellor's Budget tax cuts would increase consumer expediture
on imported goods.
    However, Ian Harwood, economist at Warburg Securities, said
his firm was sharply revising its 1987 current account deficit
forecast in the light of the latest data, cutting one billion
stg off the expected full year total to about 1.75 billion stg.
    He said news of strong growth in exports of non-oil goods
confirmed recent bullish surveys among members of the
Confederation of British Industry.
    The growth in imports appears to be flattening, even if
January's bad weather had curbed consumer spending on overseas
goods and import-intensive stock building among manufactureres,
Harwood said.
    U.K. Government bonds, or gilts, surged by more than 1/2
point on the better-than-expected news, as earlier worries
about the figures evaporated.
    Sterling peaked at a high of 1.6075 dlrs, before settling
to a steady 1.6050 dlrs about 1300 GMT, nearly a cent higher
than the European low of 1.5960.
    However, analysts noted that the turnabout in market
sentiment still looks highly vulnerable to political news.
    Morning weakness in sterling and the gilt market was
largely attributed to a newspaper opinion poll showing that the
Conservative government's support was slipping.
    The Marplan poll, published in "Today," showed Conservative
support had fallen to 36 pct, from 38 pct last month, while the
Alliance of Liberals and Social Democrats had rallied to 31
pct, from 21 pct, to run neck and neck with the Labour Party,
whose own support fell from 38 pct.
    The poll was taken after the Budget, which was greeted
enthusiastically by financial markets but seems to have left
the voters indifferent, political observers said.
    Another regular poll is due tomorrow, and eonomists warn
that today's improved sentiment could be dented if support for
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher slips again.
    This upsetting of the markets' political perceptions, which
are all but discounting a Conservative victory in the upcoming
general election, made them more sensitive to the trade data,
Harwood said. "The news did come as a very, very substantial
relief," he said.
    However, on the interest rate front, economists caution
that Lawson might be wary of leaving sterling vulnerable by
encouraging another base rate fall. They noted Lawson had
already got an inflation-reducing cut in mortgage rates in
response to lower base rates, so domestic political reasons for
lower rates have been curtailed.

The price of gold bullion is likely
to rise in the second half of the year on increased private
investor demand, West German analysts said.
    Gold could rise as high as 500 dlrs per ounce later this
year, said Peter Witte, director of Westdeutsche Landesbank
Girozentrale's trading division, after a presentation by the
U.S. Mint to promote its gold and silver Eagle series coins.
    "A lot will depend on oil prices and developments on stock
exchanges," Witte said, adding he saw gold positioned for
further rises once it breaks out above 450 dlrs.
    Gold was fixed this morning in London at 411.30 dlrs.
    Despite current strong interest in gold mine stocks, many
investors still want to buy physical gold, Witte said.
    Interest in gold mine stocks may also wane if stock
exchange rallies under way in many countries start to waver.
    Hermann Strohmeyer, vice president of Commerzbank AG's
foreign exchange trading and treasury department, said gold is
poised to rise to 460 to 470 dlrs an ounce in the second half
of this year.
    The price is unlikely to fall much below 380 or 390 dlrs an
ounce, and probably will continue in a range between 380 and
430 dlrs in the first half of this year, he said.

said it anticipates profit for fiscal 1987 ending June 30 will
be lower than fiscal 1986 earnings of 410,000 dlrs, despite an
expected revenue increase of 37 pct to more than 3.5 mln dlrs.
    After an extraordinary expense associated with the
December, 1986 withdrawal of a planned common share offering,
"we expect to be modestly profitable for the year, but below the
410,000 dlrs earned in fiscal 1986," the company said.
    Carolian previously reported fiscal six month profit of
12,933 dlrs, excluding an extraordinary loss of 17,210 dlrs,
compared to earnings of 69,829 dlrs in the prior year.
    The company said it anticipated fiscal 1987 earnings to be
lower due to withdrawal of its share offering, computer
equipment shipment delays and costs associated with sales staff
expansion.
    A strengthening Canadian dollar against U.S. currency will
also adversely affect revenues and earnings, since 85 pct of

Treasury Assistant Secretary David
Mulford reaffirmed U.S. backing for the Paris Agreement among
six industrial nations to cooperate closely to foster exchange
rate stability around current levels.
    In testimony prepared for delivery before a Senate banking
subcommittee, Mulford said there was broad recognition in Paris
that "further substantial exchange rate shifts could damage
growth and adjustment prospects."
    But he also said while there are clear understandings among
the countries regarding cooperation, "We have refrained from
establishing a system of target zones or ranges."
    Mulford also said the six nations have not spelled out the
way in which they intend to deal with possible market
developments.
    He said governments must retain flexibility in dealing with
exchange market pressures and efforts to establish rigid
exchange rate objectives "or to specify too precisely the goals
of intervention" would hurt official attempts to react to
market pressures, he said.
    Accordingly, Mulford said setting specific currency
objectives and intervention to achieve those objectives would
be counterproductive.
    Commenting on the trade deficit, Mulford reiterated the
Treasury position that the current account deficit will decline
from 148 billion dlrs last year to around 130 billion dlrs this
year, due to the exchange rate adjustments of the past 18
months.
    But he added trade imbalances would also be corrected by
commitments from West Germany and Japan to stimulate their
economies and by U.S. efforts to cut the budget deficit and
enhance U.S. competitiveness.
    He also said some newly industrialized countries should let
their currencies appreciate.

Aluminium scrap recovery and usage and
output of secondary metal will continue to rise, said Shearson
Lehman Brothers in a review of the secondary aluminium market
which details cost and demand factors.
    Although primary smelting costs have declined generally in
recent years, the still substantial energy cost savings offered
by secondary smelters will continue to make re-melted material
increasingly attractive.
    It takes around 15,000 kilowatt hours (kwh) of electricity
to produce one tonne of primary aluminium compared with around
550 kwh for one tonne of secondary metal, Shearson said.
    On the demand side, developments in automobiles and
packaging bode well for secondary aluminium consumption.
    Automobile production, although expected to fall this year,
is still on an upward trend and will continue to be so for the
foreseeable future and, in addition, use of aluminium castings
is gaining wider acceptance in the automobile industry,
particularly in the U.S.
    In packaging, Shearson does not expect aluminium to
dominate the beverage can market in any of the other major
economies to the extent it does in the U.S., But says there is
evidence recycling is on the increase in other countries.
    In addition to the cost savings involved, technology
advances now enable alloys of higher purity to be produced by
the secondary aluminium industry, Shearson said.
    There is not likely to be a problem of availability as the
U.S. Has a huge scrap reservoir and this is also true of
several European countries, albeit on a smaller scale.

The French government will present to
parliament a major bill within two months to overhaul the Paris
stock market, economics and finance minister Edouard Balladur
said.
    Balladur told an Economist conference that on the product
side, a series of new contracts, including share options and
forward contracts in European Currency Units (ECUs), would be
introduced shortly for trading on the Paris bourse.
    The scope of the new bill, however, was to transform the
organisation of equity trading, allowing participants both to
perform a banking role and to trade in equities, he said.
    "Currently, the French market is based on the Napoleonic
principle of separation of equity trading and banking. This
principle has become a dividing, and therefore a weakening,
factor for the market," Balladur said.
    He said under the planned new rules, stock brokers,
currently very specialised and undercapitalised, would be free
to link up with powerful financial institutions after a
five-year transition period.
    Stock brokerages would be subject to legislation similar to
that in the U.K. And U.S., He said, adding the Paris market
would actively attempt to attract foreign securities houses.
    Balladur said the French securities market had enjoyed
strong growth in the past 10 years, with new share and bond
issues totalling 430 billion French francs in 1986, compared
with 53 billion in 1976.
    New share issues alone totalled 63 billion francs in 1986,
up 230 pct from the 1985 level of 19 billion francs, he said.
    Total market capitalisation stood at 3,200 billion francs
at end-1986, compared with 400 billion 10 years earlier, while
stock and bond trades were valued at 2,200 billion francs last
year against 56 billion in 1976, he said.
    Balladur, who also had private talks with U.K. Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher and Chancellor of the Exchequer
Nigel Lawson, said his government was also preparing a bill to
liberalise the French insurance sector.
    Under the proposed rules, an independent regulatory
insurance commission will be set up. The commission will be
endowed with powers similar to those of a body set up earlier
to monitor the banking sector, Balladur said.
    He said the new bill would also aim to adapt insurance
regulation to take account of the ever-closer integration of
all areas of finance.

Increased activity by Switzerland's
banks pushed net capital exports to a provisional 11.7 billion

    The National Bank's currency reserves rose by 1.8 billion
francs, against a 2.8 billion rise in 1985. However, taking
into accounts effects of the shift in exchange rates, reserves
actually fell in value by 1.9 billion.

francs, from 5.1 billion in 1985, while capital exports by
domestic non-banks fell to 5.0 billion from 9.1 billion.

The Senate voted to condemn the

    The non-binding Senate resolution, a sense of Senate

    "The administration should communicate to the European
Community the message that the United States will view the
establishment of such a tax as inconsistent with the European
Community's obligations under the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade that will result in the adoption of strong and
immediate countermeasures," the resolution stated.
    The resolution said the European Community Commission has
proposed establishing a consumption tax on vegetable and fish
oils and fats in conjunction with the setting of farm prices
for the 1987/1988 EC marketing year.

the current price of soyoil and "have a restrictive effect" on
U.S. exports of soybeans and vegetable oils to the EC.
    It would be "blatantly inconsistent" with obligations of the
EC under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, GATT, the

Bank of Boston Corp expects first
quarter earnings will range between 90 cts and one dlr a share,
up from 79 cts a share last year, Chairman William Brown said.
    He told shareholders the company has a 190 mln dlr exposure
in loans to Brazil if that country defaults on its debt
payments. If a default does occur, it would first quarter
earnings by about five cts a share, which would bring the
bank's in the lower level of the estimated range, he added.
    Brown noted the 1986 first quarter net included a 17 cts
gain from loan restructurings which will not appear this year.
    Brown said the bank's other nonperforming assets, not
including its Brazilian exposure, could rise to over 700 mln
dlrs at the end of this quarter compared with 669 mln dlrs a
year earlier and 614 mln dlrs at the end of 1986.
    He said the increase includes all of its Equadorian loans
which he expects will be ultimately repaid after the company
recovers from an earthquake earlier this year.
    Brown said the increase also includes some Mexican and
Venezuelan loans as those nations are also facing credit
problems.
    Brown said the Bank of Boston remains "cautiously optimitic
about the full year even if our Brazilian exposure were to be
on nonaccural all year." In 1986, the bank earned 3.69 dlrs a
share, or 232.8 mln dlrs on net interest revenues of 1.08
billion dlrs.
    President Ira Stepanian told the shareholders's meeting the
bank's total loans to Argentina, Brazil and Mexico totaled 875
mln dlrs at the end of 1986, 37 pct of its primary capital.
Brazil loans total 300 mln dlrs, of which about two-thirds are
affected by its suspension of interest payments on its medium

The Bank of France intervened to buy
small amounts of dollars and sell yen in Paris today to
stabilise the exchange rates agreed at last month's meeting of
Finance Ministers of the Group of Five and Canada, foreign
exchange dealers said.
    But they said recent central bank intervention in the
foreign exchange markets appeared to be a limited reaction to
temporary pressures rather than a major defence operation.
    A Bank of France spokesman declined all comment but sources
close to the central bank said it had also intervened
yesterday.
    Dealers said the earlier intervention was in concert with
the Bundesbank and Bank of Japan.
    The sources said the French central bank could have been in
the market again today in two-way operations, not necessarily
on its own account, but to counter short-term pressures arising
from the end of the Japanese financial year on March 31.
    One major French bank said it bought between five and 15
mln dlrs for the central bank and sold yen at 149.28 to the
dollar.
    Another bank said it had been asked by the Bank of France
to say it was in the market, a departure from the central
bank's usual insistence on confidentiality.
    But other banks said they had seen no sign of intervention,
which they said appeared to be on a very limited scale.
    "Even if 10 banks were buying five to 15 mln dlrs, you would
still be talking of a small overall amount," said one dealer.
    Recent intervention by the Bank of Japan appeared mainly to
have been required to meet year-end window dressing demand for
yen. "This is a specific short term phenomenon rather than a
wider trend," the dealer said.
    Operators have been extremely cautious about testing the
dollar's trading ranges against the West German mark and
Japanese yen.
    These ranges were set in February's stabilisation agreement
reached here by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker and the
Finance Ministers of Japan, Germany, France, Britain and
Canada.
    But speculative pressures started to build again this week
after Baker was quoted on British television at the weekend as
repeating earlier statements that Washington had no target for
the dollar.
    Baker yesterday moved to defuse speculation he was talking
the dollar down, telling a Cable News Network interviewer and a
Senate committee he stood by the Paris agreement. Foreign
exchange markets had been misreading his comments, he said.

<Norcen Energy Resources Ltd>,
41 pct owned by <Hees International Corp>, said earnings and
cash flow will improve in 1987, even if oil and gas prices
remain at 1986 levels.
    The improvement will result from production increases,
lower taxes and royalties, reduced financing costs and from
operating efficiencies and downsizing put into place during
1986, the company said in the annual report.
    Norcen previously reported 1986 earnings, excluding a 20.1
mln dlr writeoff, declined by 58 pct to 50.0 mln dlrs from
119.7 mln dlrs in in 1985.
    Norcen's 1986 cash flow fell 10 pct to 204.9 mln dlrs from
228.9 mln dlrs in the prior year.
    It said the sharp decline in oil prices during 1986 was the
most significant factor for Norcen's reduced performance.
    "While financial results are far from the previous year's
record levels, it is clear that Norcen has withstood declining
prices and remains financially and operationally strong," Norcen
said. It did not give a specific 1987 profit forecast.
    The company said it is well positioned to capitalize on
profitable opportunities in its core business areas, and will
continue to invest to increase revenue and asset values.

Ford Motor Co neared General Motors
Corp last year in executive bonuses, while it topped the larger
automaker in profit sharing payments to workers.
    Ford, which outstripped GM in earnings last year, said its
1986 incentive bonuses totaled 167 mln dlrs, slightly behind
General Motors' 169.1 mln.
    General Motors, however, did not make any profit-sharing

    General Motors, which saw its earnings drop to 2.94 billion

sufficient to generate a payout under the profit-sharing

The Bundesbank's options for West
Germany monetary policy are limited for the foreseeable future
by the delicate stage of wage negotiations between unions and
employers, economists and money market dealers said.
    Call money fell in quite active trading today, dropping to
3.40/50 pct from 3.55/65 pct yesterday, and below the 3.50 pct
treasury bill rate as a difficult month-end approached.
    But dealers and economists said the Bundesbank was unlikely
to encourage lower rates in the foreseeable future largely for
fear of upsetting the current wage round.
    One money market dealer for a major foreign bank said, "I
don't think the Bundesbank wants rates to go up whatever
happens. But it also does not want them to fall. Above all it
wants to wait to see how the unions wage round goes."
    In West Germany, unions and employers prepare the ground
for triennial wage negotiations based on detailed assessments
of growth and inflation, economists said.
    Ute Geipel, economist with Citibank AG, said if the
Bundesbank became more accommodating in monetary policy,
raising fears in some quarters of a return in inflation in the
medium term, unions would be obliged to curtail wage demands.
    As a result the Bundesbank was concerned to make no move
that would interfere in the negotiating process, Geipel said.
    In the current round, the country's most powerful union,
the IG Metall representing metalworkers and engineers, is
demanding a shortening of the working week to 35 hours from the
present 38-1/2 and an accompanying five pct increase in wages.
    The engineering employers' association, Gesamtmetall, is
offering to bring in a 38-hour-week from July 1, 1988, and give
a two stage wage increase -- a 2.7 pct rise from April 1 this
year and another 1.5 pct from July 1, 1988.
    The agreement forged by IG Metall -- Europe's largest
union, with 2.5 mln members -- and the employers would set the
benchmark for settlements in other industries such as the
public sector, banks and federal post office. Negotiations
began in December and unions are hopeful they may conclude by
early April, ahead of the traditional holiday period in June.
    Though many economists said the unions' current warning
strikes and rhetoric were part of the negotiating strategy and
would not lead to a repeat of 1984's damaging seven-week
strikes, others said unions would not compromise greatly on
their positions and there could still be conflict.
    This could extend the length of time in which the
Bundesbank would keep its activity low-key, economists said.
    The money market head said the unions' humiliation by the
protracted financial problems of the Neue Heimat cooperative
housing venture would contribute to union obstinacy.
    "The unions haven't forgotten that and they will put this
squarely onto the account in the negotiations," he said.
    In addition, the newly-elected chairman of the IG Metall
union, Franz Steinkuehler, was more radical and determined than
his predecessor Hans Meyer and may be set for a longer battle
to achieve the best possible settlement for his membership.
    More than 16,000 engineering workers at 45 firms, mainly in
south Germany, held warning strikes lasting up to two hours
yesterday. Firms hit included Zahnradfabrik Passau GmbH and
aerospace group Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm GmbH.
    Today, 28,000 employees from 110 companies came out in
warning strikes, a statement from IG Metall said.
    Money market dealers said that overnight call money rates
would rise in the near future in any case and did not depend on
a politically-inhibited Bundesbank.
    About eight billion marks were coming into the market
tomorrow from salary payments by the federal government.
    As a result, some banks fell back on the Bundesbank's offer
to mop up liquidity via the sale of three-day treasury bills,
anticipating still lower rates before the month-end.
    But a pension payment date by banks on behalf of customers
was due on Monday, other dealers noted. If banks were short of
liquidity until the bills matured on Tuesday, rates could soar,
perhaps to the 5.50 pct Lombard ceiling.
    Banks were well stocked up with funds, having an average
52.1 billion marks in Bundesbank minimum reserves in the first
24 days of March, well above the 50.7 billion requirement.

Less than two months after First
Interstate Bancorp withdrew its bold attempt to buy BankAmerica
Corp, Chairman Joseph Pinola is still looking for a good buy,
but he is also looking at ways to avoid being bought.
    In a wide-ranging interview, Pinola said he's looking for
ways to improve profitability and capital between now and 1991,
"so as to resist any potential look at us...to maintain our
independence, if possible."
    In 1991 federal regulatory changes will allow the major
East Coast banks to buy banks in California.
    First Interstate, the fourth largest California bank, and
the nineth largest nationwide, owns 24 banks in 12 western
states and has franchise operations in four additional states.
    Bank industry sources say it is an attractive target for
large U.S. or foreign banks, looking to quickly move into the 
lucrative California market and the West Coast region.
    While declining specifics on his corporate strategy, when
asked if acquisitions will be part of the plan, Pinola replied,
"That's undoubtedly a fair statement...it would be almost naive
not to think that."
    Pinola characterized his acquisition strategy as
"opportunistic".
    He said he will look for banks in management trouble that
he can get at a bargain, then add management to restore
profitability, or for banks in states where First Interstate
already operates, then cut costs by combining resources.
    The exception, he said, would be Texas, where he said most
of the banks are already well managed, but might be purchased
at a discount because of the depressed regional economy.
    Pinola declined comment on what circumstances might move
him to rekindle his bid for BankAmerica, saying only, "We
continue to monitor and look at a lot of things and a lot of
people continue to monitor and look at us."
    Banking analysts, however, consider another First
Interstate bid at BankAmerica a long shot, not likely to happen
any time soon.
    Pinola called his decision last month to withdraw his 3.25
billion dlr bid at the nation's second largest bank, "a very,
very difficult decision."
    With that decision made, however, he acknowledged First
Interstate may now have a difficult time keeping its number
four position in the California banking community.
    "The competition in this state is tough," he said, noting
CityBank's recent purchase of 50 financial service branches
from Sears Roebuck company. "CityBank is moving rapidly to move
us down to fifth and Wells Fargo down to fourth," he said.
    Outside California, Pinola acknowledged that Security
Pacific Corp, with its recent acquisitions in Arizona,
Washington and Oregon, is quickly becoming a regional
competitor in areas where First Interstate has long dominated.
    "Security is, has been and continues to be a highly
profitable and obviously well managed company," he said.
    He added, however, First Interstate, at the moment, has the
advantages of having owned and managed regional banks longer
and has the recognition advantage of having given its regional
banks a common name.
    Pinola said while its coastal state banks are in good
financial condition, First Interstate continues to sustain
serious loan losses in its Rocky Mountain states, where energy,
real estate and agriculture dominate the economy.
    Asked if he thought loan losses in those areas had peaked,
he said, "I don't think it has bottomed out, because I think
most of the problems are real estate-related and the real
estate problems are going to be with us for several years."
    Pinola said another failing economic sector, agriculture in
the Midwest, has slowed expansion of First Interstate's
franchise operation.
    First Interstate has 42 franchise banks that offer First
Interstate financial services in ten states.
    While a year ago he was considering taking his franchise
operation east of the Mississippi River, Pinola said because
most of the franchise banks are now in the West, expansion into
the Midwest must come first.
    Calling the franchise system, "moderately profitable,"
Pinola said, "It is going to take a rejuvenation of the
agriculture sector for us to commence franchising at the speed
we were generating before the last year or two."
    On the banking industry in general, Pinola said he thinks
1987 will be another bad year for loan losses, with only banks
with minimal holdings in real estate able to improve profits.

A key U.S. House member said he
opposed a Reagan administration plan to shift the cost of
surveillance of futures exchanges to the private sector.
    "I just think user fees are the wrong way to attack a
problem of this sort," said Rep. Ed Jones (D-Tenn.), chairman
of the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Conservation, Credit
and Rural Development.
    The White House budget office has asked the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission, CFTC, to draw up a plan for
transferring the three-mln dlr cost of monitoring futures
trading to either exchanges, futures commission merchants or
users of the markets.
    CFTC Commissioner William Seale said the proposal was a
move in the wrong direction. "I would prefer to see
(surveillance) paid for through the appropriations process
rather than through taxation of market participants," he said.
    CFTC Chairman Susan Phillips told the panel the commission
was preparing the proposal, due to be completed April 15, at
the request of the Office of Management and Budget.

Private investors eagerly snapped up
shares of Consolidated Rail Corp, the biggest initial stock
offering in U.S. history, but some analysts warned they could
be in a for a bumpy ride at least in the near term.
    Analyst James Voytko of PaineWebber Group Inc believes some
investors who bought at the offering price of 28 dlrs will be
tempted to sell. The shares climbed 3-3/8 to 31-3/8 by midday.
Voytko said profit-taking pressure could become severe at the
35 dlr level. Others say Conrail, a combination of previously
bankrupt railroads, has good long term potential.
    "Conrail is in the best position to weather the current
tremendous price competition in the transportation industry in
general," said Drew Robertson, analyst at Atlantic Systems Inc,
a research firm.
    "It will survive and do damn well," said another analyst
who declined to be identified. He noted that Conrail's freight
trains serve heavy industry including steel and autos in major
U.S. cities in the northeast U.S. and midwest.
    Robertson noted that Conrail's traffic is less dependent on
coal than other railroads based in the east. He expects Conrail
to earn 2.85 dlrs per share in 1987.
    Voytko of PaineWebber sees another problem six months down
the road when more than 10 mln Conrail shares will be
distributed to current and former employees. He believes many
of these indivdiuals will be inclined to sell the stock.
    Robertson says it's hard to determine the psychology of the
average employe, but even if a lot of stock is sold, it would
would not hit the market as one big block. He doubts it would
create a big downward push on the price.
    "It's hard to call," said the analyst who requested
anonymity. In some cases employe loyalty may motivate
individuals to keep their shares, he said.
    Steven Lewins, analyst for Citicorp Investment Management,
believes the key to Conrail's long term outlook is how it is
able to invest surplus cash. He expects Conrail to earn 3.00
dlrs per share this year, flat in comparison with 1986, but by
1991 the picture could change dramatically if money not needed
for rail operations is invested wisely.
    By 1991, earnings could reach 4.30 dlrs per share, Lewins
said, factoring in reinvestment of free cash flow at
conservative rates.
    He believes motor freight will be one area of
diversification Conrail will explore.
    Elizabeth Dole, U.S. Secretary of Transportation, whose
department was responsible for the sale of Conrail, noted that
Conrail is required to reinvest in its rail system and cannot
defer necessary maintenance.
    For the historic offering of Conrail shares, Dole visited
the New York Stock Exchange and was photographed on the floor
wearing a locomotive engineer's cap, which she presented to
Stanley Crane, Conrail chairman and chief executive.
    The U.S. government is expected to receive about 1.88
billion dlrs for Conrail after factoring in underwriting fees
and other adjustments.
    The possibility of a recession at some time in the next
five years is another issue troubling some investors.
    Lewins says revenue-ton-miles, which he believes will climb
from 68.7 mln miles last year to 69.5 mln this year and 70.5
mln in 1988, will grow to 71.5 mln in 1991, but in a recession
year, perhaps 1989, the figure could dip to 64.2 mln.
    On the revenue side, he believes revenue per ton-mile will
be 4.7 cts in 1991, little changed from present levels and
exactly the same as in 1981.
    "Their basic business isn't going anywhere," he says,
explaining why emphasizes investment of cash flow.
    Voytko thinks Conrail can remain profitable in a recession
year. He points out his firm, PaineWebber, is not forecasting a
recession in any specific year, but as an example a 1990
recession of modest degree could knock earnings down to 2.20
dlrs per share. He estimated 3.00 dlrs per share this year and
3.35 dlrs next year. His 1988 figure reflects mostly a lowering
of the tax rate to 34 pct from 40 pct this year.
    Voytko believes the Conrail shares merit purchase at the 26
dlr level.
    Goldman, Sachs and Co was lead manager for the offering. A
total of 148 firms took part in the U.S. syndicate.

General Motors Corp's truck and bus plants at Pontiac, Mich,

    General Motors' truck and bus group failed to reach an
agreement on local issues with UAW Local 594 by the union's
deadline of noon today, causing a strike by 9,000 hourly
workers at the facility, the company said.
    General Motors said it was "eager" to continue meeting with
union officials on the dispute. It was not immediately clear
whether contract talks were continuing at the facility.
    General Motors spokesman Frank Cronin said the three plants
at Pontiac stopped working "as of noon today."
    He said talks will resume Friday at 1000 EST in Pontiac.
"We're hoping (the strike) will be of very brief duration,"
Cronin said.
    Bus-manufacturing operations at one of the three
plants--the Pontiac Central facility--are being sold to
Greyhound Corp <G>, although GM will retain the facility.
    Cronin said about 400 workers on the bus line will be laid
off "whenever we fulfill production commitments" on the buses,
"possibly in May."
    The Pontiac Central plant also makes medium- and heavy-duty
trucks. Assembly of the medium trucks is scheduled to move to

A proposal by the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission, CFTC, to raise federal limits on futures
speculative positions for certain agricultural commodity
contracts would not reverse a decline in liquidity in those
markets that started in 1981, two CFTC commissioners said.
    Commissioners William Seale and Kalo Hineman told a House
Agriculture subcommittee a recent proposal that would have the
effect of raising deferred month speculative position limits on
several agricultural commodity contracts would not
substantially increase liquidity in those months.
    "I seriously doubt that increasing speculative limits will
create a great deal of liquidity in the back months," Seale
told the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Conservation, Credit
and Rural Development.
    Analysts have attributed much of the liquidity squeeze to a
1981 tax law change, which by changing the treatment of
so-called straddles limited the ability of futures commission
merchants to roll positions forward for tax purposes.
    CFTC Chairman Susan Phillips said only that the commission
would take into account Congress' recommendation that federal
speculative limits be raised.
    The Chicago Board of Trade and the MidAmerica Commodity
Exchange have expressed concern that the CFTC plan would
decrease spot month limits for certain of their contracts.

Federal Reserve Board Governor
Robert Heller said the banking system could be strengthened by
permitting formation of financial services holding companies
involved in areas like banking, insurance, real estate and
securities.
    In a speech prepared for delivery in New York to the Bank
and Financial Analysts' Association, Heller said, "I believe
that increased diversification along geographic and product
lines is the key to strengthening the American banking system."
    He said he supported the idea of financial services holding
companies advocated by the Association of Bank Holding
Companies in which regulation of various bank, thrift,
insurance, investment, securities and real estate subsidiaries
would be handled on functional lines.
    "Limits would be placed on the extension of credit by the
bank to the associated institutions, and all transactions would
have to be on an arms-length basis," Heller said.
    Measures would be necessary to avoid abuse of the banks'
special position by such holding companies or subsidiaries.
    Heller said he "would require the holding company to serve
as a 'source of strength' to the bank by making a commitment to
maintain the bank's capital.
    "In other words, the bank would not be allowed to fail as
long as the holding company has a positive net worth."
    Heller also said commercial enterprises should be permitted
to own a financial services holding company, again with the
provision that capital would flow to the financial enterprise
if necessary.
    Heller said the effects of these actions "would be banks
that are at least as strong as the corporations holding them" in
which customer deposits were assured while any incentive to
"loot the bank" was removed.
    Such diversification would give access to national and
international financial services to corporations across the
United States.
    Heller said that would mean "the steady decline of America's
banks in the world financial league tables would be arrested" by
permitting them to become more competitive.

The chairman of the CFTC, Susan
Phillips, said she does not expect the CFTC to restrict dual
trading or to intervene in the quarterly expiration of stock
index futures and their options.
     "At this time we have no plans to reexamine our policy (on
dual trading)," she told the House Subcommittee on
Conservation, Credit and Rural Development.
    She said it would not be appropriate to ban dual trading
because it would decrease market liquidity.
    Dual trading refers to the ability of futures commission
merchants to trade for their own as well as their clients'
accounts. Exchange rules prohibit a broker from attempting to
benefit from the market impact of a client's order by trading
on his own account before placing the client's order.
    CFTC has required all futures exchanges by July 1 to have
implemented audit trails permitting the reconstruction of all
trades to the nearest minute. The move was designed in part to
discourage abuse of dual trading.
    The board of directors of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
has proposed limiting but not banning dual trading in the
Standard and Poor's 500 stock index future pit.
    Phillips indicated the CFTC would not move beyond requiring
improved audit trails in its effort to allay concerns about
dual trading abuses.
    "It would be inappropriate at this point until we see how
the audit trail will work," she said in response to a question.
    On triple-witching, Phillips said recent experiments by
markets to quell price fluctuations have been quite successful
and that users of securities and derivative instruments were
still learning how to deal with the quarterly phenomenon.
    Triple-witching refers to the simultaneous expiration of
stock index futures, options on those futures and options on
certain individual stocks.
    The CFTC chairman noted the commission has heightened
surveillance of markets on triple-witching day.
    "We aren't sure any other regulatory changes are needed at
this point," Phillips said.

The Reagan administration said the
national crisis in liability insurance eased during the past
year as the insurance industry's profits more than doubled to
11.5 billion dlrs, but some problems still persist.
    An administration working group, in an update of its report
a year ago, found that insurance premiums generally have
stabilized, but at high levels, as the crisis has abated.
    After severe financial difficulties in 1984 and 1985, the
insurance industry's rate of return last year recovered to the
same level as the performace of U.S. corporations in general,
the group said in a 98-page study.
    While the crisis has eased, the study found that liability
insurance will likely remain expensive and continue to be
difficult to obtain for some lines of coverage and for some
sectors of the American economy.
    Some types of insurance, especially associated with
environmental liability, remain unavailable for many companies
at any price, it said.
    The increased availability and the price stability for
insurance the past year has been accompanied by higher
deductibles, lower coverage limits and additional policy
restrictions, the study said.
    The administration last year unveiled a wide range of
recommendations aimed at dealing with the crisis, including 
limits on punitive damages and awards for pain, suffering and
mental anguish at 100,000 dlrs.
    Attorney General Edwin Meese told a news conference today
that the administration still supports state efforts to place
limits on damage awards and to enact other reforms of the tort
laws.
    Assistant Attorney General Richard Willard denied charges
by consumer groups that the insurance crisis was caused by
industry collusion to raise rates in violation of the antitrust
laws. Willard, the head of the working group, said excessive
jury damage awards was the main reason for the insurance
liability problem.

Former Secretary of the Treasury
Robert Anderson, whom Dwight Eisenhower once said deserved to
be president, pleaded guilty to income tax evason charges and
illegally running an offshore bank.
    Anderson, declaring that he was "deeply regretful," admitted
to evading tax on 127,500 dlrs in undeclared income.   Much of
the money was paid to him for lobbying for controversial South
Korean evangelist Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church.
    The 77-year-old Anderson was President Eisenhower's
treasury secretary from 1957 to 1961 and a prominent
businessman afterwards. In his memoirs, Eisenhower said
Anderson deserved to be president.
    Standing before Federal Court Judge Edmund Palmieri,
Anderson, who faces up to 10 years in jail, said he had
recently undergone two operations and treatment for alcoholism.
    The judge set May 7 for sentencing and U.S. Attorney
Rudolph Giuliani declared the government would ask that
Anderson be sent to jail.
    According to the indictment, Anderson was a prinicipal  of
the Commercial Exchange Bank and Trust Ltd of Anguilla in the
British West Indies for two years ending in 1985.
    During that time, government prosecutors said the bank
conducted operations in New York city but failed to register
with state and federal banking authorities. Depositors have
lost at least 4 mln dlrs.
    Anderson pleaded gulity only for the tax year 1984 but
admitted other tax transgressions for the previous year and
faces civil fines for both years.
    Among other things, he said he received 80,000 dlrs in 1983
from a shell corporation for lobbying for the Unification
Church. The money was given to him as a no-interest loan
repayable in 1990 but the government said it should have been
reported as income.

Several U.S. House members urged

its proposed rules governing the sale of foreign futures and

      "I'm from the state of Illinois, and we don't want to see
Chicago's futures markets become the automobile or textile
industry of the 1980s," Rep. Lane Evans (D-Ill.) told a hearing
of the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Conservation, Credit
and Rural Development.
      U.S. exchanges have complained that the proposed
regulations would give sellers of foreign futures an edge over
domestic futures sellers because they would be subject to less
rigorous requirements, especially in the area of capital.
      Phillips said the commission has no way of requiring
foreign markets to implement the same regulatory safeguards as
in the U.S., but that the proposed rules would ensure marketing
of foreign futures and options conform to U.S. requirements.
     "If people want to enter into these (foreign) markets,
they know they will not have the same regulations," she said.
      Phillips said the commission would consider changes in
its proposal to require segregation of customer accounts and
clarify the treatment of contracts not traded on foreign

British Petroleum Co Plc does not
intend to raise the price of its planned 70 dlr per share offer
for the publicly held 45 pct of Standard Oil Co, BP Managing
Director David Simon said.
    "We don't seen this as any progressive bidding game," he
told reporters at a news conference. BP now owns 55 pct of
Standard's stock.
    Simon said BP had carefully considered the amount of its
planned bid and he quoted an oil analyst, whom he would not
identify, as saying BP's careful evaluation means the company
is not going to raise its offer.
    "I think that (an increase) would be totally wrong. I think
the price is very fair and it is much to early to speculate
about ligigation," he said. "Let's wait and see how the offer
runs."
    Another official declined to speculate under what
circumstances BP might raise its bid.
    The BP official said the 70 dlrs a share offer is 7.2 times
Standard's 1986 cash flow and 56 pct above an independent
evaluation of the company's assets, including the value of its
oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas reserves.
    He said the price Royal Dutch/Shell Group <RD> <SC> paid
for publicly held Shell Oil Co shares in 1985 was 5.1 times
cash flow.
    The BP official also said the 70 dlr bid is a 40 pct
premium over Standard's stock price over the past year.
    BP Group Treasurer Rodney Chase said more than half to as
much as two-third's of the 7.4 billion dlrs BP needs for its
offer will come from existing sources. The rest will be
financed by new debt.
    BP will draw in cash from its operating companies around
the world and is also arranging a five billion dlr line of
credit, he explained.
    The company's debt to equity ratio will rise 11 or 12
percentage points from the current 33 pct if the offer is
completed, Chase said. But the ratio will be back below 40 pct
within 12 months, he added.
    Chase also said 50 to 60 pct of Standard Oil's publicly
held shares are held by financial institutions.
    Simon said Standard's board was informed of the offer on
March nine and has been considering it since that time.
    He said BP does not expect any regulatory problems that
would delay completion of the acquisition. "We have informed
Washington of our intentions and we've already been an integral
part of ownership of U.S. oil reserves," he pointed out.
    Simon said there is a good chance that current world oil
prices of about 18 dlrs a barrel could be maintained, and that
the more stable market is due mostly to changes in policy in
Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members to control oil production.
    "We think there are signals that current conditions are
more favorable than they have been for sometime," Simon said.
    "We have hopes for greater stability, but we do not see
prices going much higher," he added.

British Petroleum Plc's plan to pay
7.4 billion dlrs for less than half of Standard Oil Co has
signalled higher values in the U.S. oil patch, analysts said.
    "I think that BP's bid is a very strong affirmation and
clear signal that they have confidence in the U.S., and they
think the barrel of oil in the ground is going to go higher,"
said Sanford Margoshes of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
    BP earlier today said its U.S. unit planned to tender at 70
dlrs per share for the 45 pct of Standard it does not already
own.
    "It's a 7.4 billion dlr price that (shows) OPEC has won the
war and oil prices are not going to crack," said Prescott, Ball
and Turben analyst Bruce Lazier.
    "Behind that is a huge implication for the rest of the
energy issues out there in the stock market, particularly those
that are acquisition targets," Lazier said.
    One of those mentioned by Lazier was USX Corp, an
energy-steel concern which had been courted by investor Carl
Icahn and drew the attention of Australian Robert Holmes a
Court last year. Rumors continue to swirl around its stock.
    Margoshes said he does not foresee major U.S. oil firms
falling into takeover situations for several years, with the
exception of possibly Amerada Hess Corp <AHC>. He said most of
the majors found partners in the last round of matchmaking
which ended two years ago, and others restructured to the point
that they have become unattractive.
    U.S. oil stocks rallied in response to the offer. Exxon
Corp <XON> rose 1-1/8 to 88-1/2. Chevron Corp <CHV> jumped
1-1/8 to 58-7/8, and Texaco <TX> climbed 1/4 to 37-3/4. Unocal
Corp <UCL> rose 1-3/4, while Occidental Petroleum Corp <OXY>
climbed 1-1/8 to 34-3/4. Amoco Corp <AN> rose 1-3/8 to 83-3/4.
    Standard Oil's stock was up 6-1/4 in heavy trading to
71-1/8. Earlier in the session it had been at a high of 72-1/4.
Wall Street has speculated British Petroleum may boost its
offer by several dlrs per share, but the company maintained it
would not raise the 70 dlr bid.
    British Petroleum stock rose 2-1/4 to 59-5/8.
    Analysts said the fact British Petroleum made such a bid in
the first place indicates that the British oil giant has
changed its outlook for the oil industry.
    Analysts said last year British Petroleum held one of the
more bearish positions on oil prices.
    "They said the real price of oil would stay at 15 dlrs (a
barrel) for several years, and I think they beat a hasty
retreat from that point of view," Margoshes said.
    "They are more appropriately today looking more
optimistically. I believe they are looking at 18 dlrs
(long-term)...also in their heart of hearts they believe that
will be exceeded," Margoshes said.
    The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate was
trading today around 18.60 dlrs per barrel.
    Analysts said British Petroleum might have been able to buy
up the rest of Standard Oil for about 50 dlrs per share when
oil prices were falling last year.
    They said Standard Oil's brightest asset is its slightly
more than 50 pct ownership of the Alaskan Prudhoe Bay oil
field. Analysts also said the company has other interests in
the Alaskan North Slope.
    Analysts said the Standard investment is extremely
attractive to BP because the U.S. is the largest oil market and
has hard-to-replace reserves.
    "I think it just fits in with their long-range plans to
increase their position in the U.S. market," Dean Witter
analyst Eugene Nowak said.
    Analysts said it also raises BP's visibility ahead of the
British government's announced disposal of 31.7 pct of BP
stock. The U.K. government said it would dispose of the holding
sometime in the year beginning April one.
    After acquiring all of Standard, most of BP's reserves
would be in the U.S., but only about six pct of its stock is
held in the U.S.
    "The only way they can sell all that stock is to move it
into the United States. No other market can handle all that
stock," said L.F. rothschild analyst Rosario Ilacqua.
    In 1986, Standard Oil had net losses of 345 mln dlrs on
revenues of 10.02 billion dlrs, compared to a profit the year
earlier of 308 mln dlrs on revenues of 13.82 billion dlrs.

The U.S. General Accounting Office
said generic commodities certificates cost the U.S. government
in total Commodity Credit Corp outlays 107 mln to 653 mln dlrs
more than cash payments through February, 1987.
    However, GAO Senior Associate Director Brian Crowley, in
testimony prepared for delivery to the Senate Agriculture
Committee, said short-term commodity storage cost savings
related to the use of payment-in-kind certificates could be
from about 169 mln 253 mln dlrs.
    U.S. Agriculture Undersecretary Daniel Amstutz said the
issuance of 8.5 billion dlrs of certificates in fiscal years
1986-88 could cost as much as 550 mln dlrs more than cash
outlays.
    In his prepared remarks to the Senate panel, Amstutz
stressed that USDA was "very pleased with the success of using
commodity certificates" and looked forward to their continued
use.
    He said the cost of using certificates must be weighed
against immediate benefits, including greater market liquidity,
improved market price competitiveness, higher farm income,
improved debt situation and decreased carrying charges,
especially pertaining to 1985 crop loans.
    Crowley said future government storage costs would be
reduced only if in the long run certificates led to a decrease
in CCC-owned inventory.
    "We believe that such a reduction, if it occurs, will not
be large," Crowley said.
    Crowley also said that because certificate amounts are not
included in the federal budget's outlay totals at the time of
issuance, they could "lessen the usefulness of the budget."
    Crowley conceded that certificates help farmers avoid
storage costs, give them marketing flexibility and enhance
farmers' incomes.
    He also said certificates have benefited the grain industry
by giving it easier access to CCC-owned grain at market prices.

Bank of England Governor Robin
Leigh-Pemberton said the Paris pact agreed between six leading
industrialised nations set no nominal exchange rate targets.
    Leigh-Pemberton said in oral evidence to a select committee
that "we did not swap numbers - we reached an understanding" on
how to cooperate towards stabilizing currencies at around their
current levels.
    He said the accord had brought Britain into a form of joint
currency float - but one which let it still purse an
independent monetary policy. "I would concede that, since the
Louvre Accord, we are acting as if we are in something,"
Leigh-Pemberton said.
    "The Louvre and Plaza accords show there is a very effective
role for the (Group of) seven central banks to operate together"
towards stabilising exchange rates," Leigh-Pemberton said.
    He did not mention this week's intervention by central
banks to support the dollar, after markets decided to test the
accord.
     Leigh-Pemberton said that "the effectiveness of this
(cooperation) is actually larger than many of us had thought in
the pre-Plaza days" before September 1985.
    He did not indicate what exchange rate levels were broadly
sought by the six nations, and noted that "we are more effective
in our agreement if we can leave the markets guessing."
    He did not indicate what exchange rate levels were broadly
sought by the six nations, and noted that "we are more effective
in our agreement if we can leave the markets guessing."
    Leigh-Pemberton said that, in principle, the Bank of
England favoured full EMS membership for sterling, provided
such a move did not endanger U.K. Anti-inflation monetary
policy. Asked whether he wanted to see U.K. Interest rates
lower, he said "the two half point cuts (this month in banks'
base lending rates) have been appropriate up until now."
    Leigh-Pemberton said he preferred a "cautious step-by-step
approach" to reducing short term interest rates, not least
because "we have a potential problem with inflation."
    Underlying U.K. Inflation was currently around 4.0 pct, "one
of the highest" among industrialised nations, he added.
    Leigh-Pemberton said the Bank of England had not wanted
base rates to fall before the unveiling of the 1987/88 budget
on March 17, but he said pressure from financial markets for
such a move had proved irresistible. Base rates are now at 10
pct.
    Regarding sterling's relationship with oil, Leigh-Pemberton
said that the pound could be seen being undervalued overall.
    He said the current oil price of some 18 dlrs a barrel
might suggest a level of 74 on the Bank of England's sterling
index, when compared with the index's level before oil prices
dropped from around the 30 dlr level. The index, base 1975,
closed here today at 72.1, unchanged from the previous close.

N.T. and S.A., Seafirst Corp and Seattle-First National Bank.
    The actions affect 5.5 billion dlrs of debt.
    Moody's said the downgrade reflected its concern over
prospects for material improvement in the holding company's
operating profitability in the medium term.
    Cut were BankAmerica's senior debt to Ba-1 from Baa-3,
subordinated debt to Ba-3 from Ba-1, preferred stock to B-1
from Ba-3 and commercial paper to Not-Prime from Prime-3.
    BankAmerica is the second-largest bank holding company in
the U.S.
    Moody's reduced the subsidiary BankAmerica Overseas
Finance's senior debt to Ba-1 from Baa-3 and subordinated debt
to Ba-3 from Ba-1. That debt is guaranteed by the parent.
    The rating agency also cited the holding company's
continuing high level of problem assets, including significant
exposure to Latin American debtor countries, that will continue
to pressure profitability.
    However, Moody's noted that BankAmerica Corp remains liquid
and owns considerable marketable assets.
    Moody's said it affirmed the ratings of the Bank of America
unit because of that bank's franchise value, significant core
deposit base and an expectation of regulatory support if
further stresses develop.

Debt securities of major U.S. banks
came under light selling pressure in secondary trading on the
heels of Standard and Poor's Corp's downgrade of six money
center banks late yesterday, analysts and traders said.
    But they described market response as muted because the S
and P action came as no surprise. Besides, many participants
had already shied away from bank issues following Brazil's
suspension of interest payments last month, traders added.
    "The downgrades were expected for some time. In fact, you
can argue that S and P is lagging the market," commented one
trader.
    On February 20, Brazil said it would suspend interest
payments on about 68 billion dlrs owed to foreign commercial
banks. No date was established for the renewal of payments.
    In its action, Standard and Poor's cited the exposure to
major Latin American debtor countries of Chase Manhattan Corp
<CMB>, Chemical New York Corp <CHL>, Irving Bank Corp <V> and
Manufacturers Hanover Corp <MHC>.
    The rating agency also downgraded Mellon Financial Corp
<MEL> and Security Pacific  Corp <SPC>, but said this reflected
higher non-performing assets and weaker operating results
rather than the international debt problem.
    "The S and P downgrades were a non-event," a trader said.
"Anyone who was caught unaware was not on top of the situation
anyway."
    Said another trader, "People talked about this before and
after S and P's announcement. There was not much reaction among
bank issues today, though prices are still below par."
    Still, market watchers said the action further undermined
sentiment for bank paper.
    Because of Brazil's suspension of interest payments, U.S.
bank paper has underperformed such other sectors as utilities,
telephones and industrials, analysts pointed out.
    Even though Standard and Poor's affirmed the debt ratings
of Citicorp <CCI>, Bankers Trust New York <BT>, Bank of Boston
Corp <BKB> and J.P. Morgan and Co Inc <JPM>, few buyers can be
found for securities issued by those banks, traders said.
    "Let's face it. Investors believe these banks are also
exposed to Latin and other debtor countries. And investors buy
on perceptions," said one broker.
    About the only bright spots in an otherwise dull banking
sector of the secondary corporate market are U.S. regional
banks and Japanese banks because investors perceive them as
less exposed to the debtor nations, analysts pointed out.

Royal Bank of Canada Chairman Allan
Taylor said Ottawa and the provinces risk weakening the
country's financial system if they do not agree on a harmonized
regulatory regime for financial institutions.
    Taylor also said it was vital that the federal government 
retain its existing powers under Ottawa's major new proposals
to revamp the country's financial system.
    "Unless great care is taken now, in the detailed drafting
and implementation of regulatory change, we could actually end
up weakening our financial system," Taylor told a business
luncheon.
    "Also, we must avoid costly and inefficient duplication of
regulation and supervision between federal and provincial
authorities," Taylor continued.
    Earlier this week Federal Minister of State for Finance,
Tom Hockin, said progress was being made with his provincial
counterparts on the proposals that involve removing the
traditional barriers separating the banking, securities and 
insurance sectors.
    The governments are attempting to resolve a jurisdictional
dispute over who regulates what under the new system. The
provinces have traditionally had authority in the securities
field while Ottawa oversaw the banking sector.
    But the Chairman of Canada's largest bank stressed that 
Ottawa should retain its regulatory powers to "preserve an
efficient, competitive, national financial system."
    On the free trade talks under way with the U.S., Taylor
said Canadian negotiators must insure banks have as much access
to the American market as U.S. institutions are granted here.
    He told a new conference later he was "reasonably
confident" the Canadian side was making reciprocity in
financial services an issue at the negotiating table.

French Agricultural Minister
Francois Guillaume warned that France would flatly reject
proposed reforms of the European Community, EC, cereals, sugar
and oilseeds sectors, which he said would disrupt these
markets.
    The EC Commission's proposals to shorten the intervention
period and lower monthly premiums for cereals and increase the
financial burden on the sugar producers will also result in
lower real prices for producers, he told farmers here.
    "I give you my word that France, while it will not reject
technical adjustments or serious discussion, will simply reply
in the negative to these bad reforms," Guillaume told the annual
conference of the country's major farm union, FNSEA 
(Federation Nationale des Syndicats Dexploitants Agricoles).
    Community agricultural ministers are due to meet again
Monday to try and agree a package of reforms to curb spiralling
EC output and fix farm prices for 1987/88.
    Relations between the government and farmers have become
strained in France in recent months.
    There have been sporadic but frequent demonstrations by
farmers protesting over sharp falls in meat and pork prices and
further cutbacks in Community milk output.
    But Guillaume's warning that he would reject reorganisation
of the EC cereal and sugar markets -- France being a major
producer of both crops -- won him warm applause from the
FNSEA's farmers.
    His pledge to fight the EC proposals and push for the
complete dismantling of the system of cross border taxes
designed to smooth out currency differences known as Monetary
Compensatory Amounts, MCA's, however, are unlikely to avoid
further protests by producers.
    Farm leader Raymond Lacombe said the union planned to go
ahead with a series of major protests both in France and abroad
against the EC Commission's proposals to overhaul the farm
sector.
    "The Minister's proposals back up our determination to
organise union action in the coming weeks," he told reporters,
adding that this could also act in Guillaume's favour on a
ministerial level.
    Guillaume was head of the FNSEA for many years before being
appointed farm minister last spring.
    Lacombe refused to say whether the farmers felt that
Guillaume was doing a good job as farm minister.
    There have been certain advances on cutting production
costs, reducing fiscal costs and awarding drought aid, but
there are still areas where more could be done such as on
farmers' indebtedness, he said.
    Guillaume told the conference the government will make
available 2.4 billion francs (396 mln dlrs) to help producers
reduce milk output and to encourage older farmers to retire.
    The government has already announced financial aid for the
milk sector and it was not clear how much of the package
announced today was new aid, Lacombe said.

billion-dlr package of budget deficit reductions, half through
unspecificed new revenues, to cut the 1988 deficit with a goal
of balancing the budget in 1991 under a new law's target.
    The committee went over a package of deficit reductions
proposed by its chairman, Democrat Lawton Chiles of Florida,
which he said would reach the 108-billion-dlr deficit in 1988
under the Gramm-Rudman budget law -- using President Reagan's
economic estimates.
    Using the Congressional Budget Office estimates, which
Congress usually relies on, would produce a deficit of 134
billion dlrs, Chiles said.
    Under the Chiles plan, deficits would be cut from
anticipated levels by nearly 110 billion dlrs over four years
to produce a 1991 balanced budget--the target of the Gramm
Rudman law.
    For 1988, the Chiles formula would cut the deficit by 37
billion dlrs, half through defence and non defence savings,m
the rest through revenues.
    Defence would be cut nearly 6.9 billion dlrs. Reagan
proposed hiking outlays by some 8 billion dlrs.
    His non defence budget savings, including health, welfare,
agricultural, government services and reduced interest
payments, amount to 11.6 billion dlrs.

A huge five billion dlr credit facility
being syndicated for two subsidiaries of British Petroleum Co
Plc <BP.L> should be well received in the market, given the
relatively generous terms it carries, banking sources said.
    The sources said they believe the committed four year
revolving credit - the largest of its kind in the euromarkets -
carries a facility fee of 1/8 pct and that drawings will be at
1/8 pct over the London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor).
    Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of New York, which is arranging
the financing in conjunction with its London operation, was not
available to commment on the terms.
    BP announced it was arranging the financing earlier today
as part of its planned tender offer for the 45 pct of Standard
Oil Co that it does not own already.
    In addition to the revolving credit, BP also is arranging a
U.S. commercial paper program for an as yet undetermined
amount, which will be supported by the revolver.
    Bankers noted that the terms on the new facility compare
extremely favourably to those on other short-term facilities
for which pricing has turned extremely fine due to competition
for the mandates. It also contrasts with the 1/16 pct fee BP
paid on a recent 1.5 billion dlr refinancing of some existing
debt.
    Earlier today a Morgan Guaranty official, while declining
to reveal the pricing on the facility said that banks would be
"compensated fairly" since this is a special purpose facility
which must be completed quickly, with the signing expected in
about 10 days.
    The facility is only being syndicated among BP's
relationship banks and therefore has large individual
commitments from the banks. Lead managers are being recruited
at the 200 mln dlr level, co-lead managers at 125 mln and
managers at 75 mln.
    However, bankers said that despite the size it is likely
the financing will get done quickly since banks will want to be
seen as supporting the relationship.
    The financing is being arranged in the name of BP
International and BP North America.

Farm-state Senators indicated they
may broaden a Farm Credit System rescue package to include aid
for borrowers from private lenders such as commercial banks, as
well as the farm credit system.
    Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., chairman of the Senate
Agriculture subcommittee responsible for farm credit, said
legislation to rescue the financially-troubled system should
provide help to borrowers from all lenders to agriculture.
    "We must provide some form of interest rate buydown,
principal reduction relief for all eligible farmers and
ranchers regardless of their lending institution," Boren said.
    Boren's statement received bipartisan support from Sen.
James McClure, R-Idaho, who agreed that the aid package should
cover all lenders to agriculture.
    The comments by Senators of both parties, plus endorsements
for the across-the-board approach from the nation's largest
farm organization, the American Farm Bureau Federation, and
from the system itself, appeared to significantly broaden the
focus of the rescue legislation for the farm credit system.
Until now, agriculture officials had focused exclusively on how
to resurrect the failing system.
    Boren said borrowers from private lenders such as
commercial banks and life insurance companies must be included
in the aid package because "it would not be fair to address
only the problems of Farm Credit System borrowers."
    However, Boren and other proponents of an across-the-board
interest rate or principal buydown did not say how much the
broad approcah would cost.

Decision Industries Corp said it
expects to report an operating loss of 19-24 cts a share for
the first quarter ending March 31 mainly due to lower profit
margins and higher sales and marketing costs.

revenues of 45 mln dlrs.
    Decision also said it entered into an agreement to sell its
International Computerized Telemarketing Inc subsidiary to an
investor group headed by the unit's senior management. Terms

The federal Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) proposed new rules that would require
accounting firms that audit public companies to submit to a
periodic outside review of their operations.
    The SEC voted unanimously to seek public comment on the
plan, under which an accounting firm would have to hire another
firm to conduct a so-called "peer review" every three years or
lose the right to audit public companies.
    SEC officials conceded peer review would not end all
audit failures but said they hoped it would eliminate audits by
clearly unqualified firms and individuals.
    "Peer review will not stop all bad audits; we recognize
that," SEC Chief Accountant Clarence Sampson told the five SEC
commissioners.
    "But we hope the rule will go far to eliminate audits
performed by individuals without the necessary skills to
conduct a proper audit," Sampson said.
    The move is largely symbolic, since firms and individuals
responsible for auditing 84 pct of all public companies already
voluntarily undergo peer review every three years, under an
accounting industry self-regulatory plan.
    But the SEC has been under pressure for years from some
federal lawmakers to make the accounting industry more open and
accountable to the public.
    Agency officials estimated that a peer review would cost
the average accounting firm between 1,500 and 2,500 dlrs, or
500 to 750 dlrs a year.
    "I don't think that (cost) is a dispositive issue," SEC
Chairman John Shad said. "It's within a reasonable range of
cost."
    The proposal would exempt foreign auditors of non-U.S.
companies required to file financial reports with the SEC.

Moody's Investors Service Inc said it
may downgrade British Petroleum Co PLC's 3.5 billion dlrs of
debt and Standard Oil Co's 3.8 billion dlrs of debt.
    The agency cited British Petroleum's 7.4 billion dlr tender
offer today for the remaining 45 pct of Standard Oil shares it
does not already own.
    Moody's said that while British Petroleum has greatly
strengthened its capital structure over the past few years,
this acquisition would seriously affect the company's
liquidity, leverage and interest coverage.
    Moody's noted that British Petroleum would use more than
two billion dlrs of excess cash and marketables and about five
billion dlrs of new acquisition debt to fund the transaction.
    In addition, the minority interest and deferred income
taxes attributable to Standard Oil would be excluded from
British Petroleum's capitalization. That would result in a
total debt to capital ratio of nearly 50 pct, Moody's said.
    The rating agency said it would study B.P.'s strategy to
restore financial flexibility after the acquisition. Moody's
said that may include divestiture of various petroleum and
non-petroleum assets and operations of B.P. and Standard.
    But Moody's noted that after the major asset writedown and
divestiture progress achieved by Standard Oil in 1985, fewer
non-petroleum assets are available for sale.
    Under review are the A-1 senior debt of issues guaranteed
by British Petroleum, including Eurobonds of BP Capital B.V.,
debentures of BP North America Finance Corp, Eurodebt of
British Petroleum B.V., BPCA Finance Ltd and BP Canadian
Holdings Ltd, debentures and medium-term notes of BP North
America Inc. Also, the A-1 debt of Standard Oil and Sohio

British Petroleum Co PLC may have to
raise its planned 70 dlrs a share tender offer for the publicly
traded shares of Standard Oil Co <SRD>, analysts said.
    "There's a lot of speculation here that someway or other
they would be forced to come up with another bid," said Rosario
Ilaqua of L.F. Rothschild.
    And despite BP managing director David Simon's denial today
that BP would raise the offer, the analysts said that remained
a distinct possibility.
    Analysts said they base their thinking on Royal Dutch/Shell
Group's <RD> <SC> bid to buy the outstanding stake of Shell Oil
Co in 1984 and 1985. Royal Dutch/Shell eventually raised its
initial 55 dlrs a share offer to 60 dlrs a share, after
lawsuits by minority shareholders.
    "I think they're going to have to go a little higher
eventually, just as Royal Dutch/Shell had to go a little higher
for the Shell Oil minority shares," Bruce Lazier of Prescott
Ball and Turben said. He estimated a price of 75 dlrs a share.
    Royal Dutch/Shell offered 55 dlrs a share for the 30.5 pct
of Shell Oil it did not already own in January of 1984. After
objections from minority shareholders about the price, Royal
Dutch/Shell raised its bid and began a 58 dlrs a share tender
offer in April 1984.
    But shareholders sued and a court blocked completion of the
offer. After months of wrangling over the worth of Shell Oil,
Royal Dutch/Shell agreed to another two dlrs increase.
    It ended up paying 5.67 billion dlrs for the outstanding
Shell Oil stake, a significant premium to its original bid of
about 5.2 billion dlrs.
    The analysts made their comments before Simon's remarks at
a BP press conference in New York this afternoon.
    Sanford Margoshes of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc told
clients this morning that a sweetened offer was possible. The
analyst said the bid could be raised by two dlrs a share.
    Analysts do not expect regulatory hurdles because of the
Royal Dutch/Shell group precedent. But there may be shareholder
lawsuits for the same reason, they said.
    Goldman Sachs and Co, BP's investment advisor, advised the
Shell Oil board in 1984 and 1985.

    Last year, the report noted, the cash flow from operations
dropped to 1.8 billion dlrs from 3.5 billion dlrs in 1985 and
3.2 billion dlrs in 1984 due principally to lower oil prices.
    The report, prepared before British Petroleum Co Plc <BP>

capital spending at 1.6 billion dlrs, down from the 1.7 billion
dlrs projected in January.
    Standard's capital spending totaled 1.77 billion dlrs in
1986.
    The report showed a decline in proven oil reserves to 2.41
billion barrels at the end of 1986 from 2.65 billion barrels a
year earlier as discoveries and other additions dropped to 11.4
mln barrels last year from 23.2 mln in 1985.

from 7.22 trillion at the end of 1985 despite a 30.9 mln cubic
feet downward revision in previous reserve estimates during

cubic feet last year, up from 175.9 billion in 1985, it added.

The former chief currency
dealer of Herstatt Bank, which collapsed in 1974 on foreign
exchange speculation in West Germany's biggest banking crash,
can stand trial for damages, a court ruled.
    The court overturned a claim by Danny Dattel that a case
for damages should not be allowed after such a long interval.
    Herstatt creditors are seeking 12.5 mln marks from Dattel,
whom they accuse of causing losses at the bank of over 500 mln
marks by manipulating forward foreign exchange contracts.
    The crash of the private Herstatt bank with losses of over
one billion marks stunned West Germany's business community,
and led to a tightening of banking regulations.
    The losses were even greater than the 480 mln marks
announced recently by Volkswagen as a result of fraud in
currency transactions.
    Ivan Herstatt, managing director of the bank when it
collapsed, was sentenced to four and a half years in prison in
1984 but appealed. Six other people associated with the bank
were jailed in 1983.
    But Dattel was freed from prosecution after he produced
medical evidence of paranoia caused by Nazi persecution during
his childhood, which might have led him to take his own life.

International Business Machines Corp
said scientists at its Zurich research laboratory have taken a
key step toward developing a method of testing computer chips

    IBM said chip makers will need such advanced testing
methods to aid them in developing the next generation of
semiconductors.
    These chips will be smaller than today's chips but will be
able to store vastly greater amounts of information.
    IBM said its technique uses a laser light for "contactless"
measuring of electrical signals on metal lines similar to the
kind found in computer chip circuitry.
    It said that using commercially available lasers, the
method should permit measurements of circuits with a width of
one micrometer or less.

Farm-state senators indicated they
may broaden a Farm Credit System rescue package to include aid
for borrowers from private lenders such as commercial banks, as
well as the farm credit system.
    Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., chairman of the Senate
Agriculture subcommittee responsible for farm credit, said
legislation to rescue the financially-troubled system should
provide help to borrowers from all lenders to agriculture.
    "We must provide some form of interest rate buydown,
principal reduction relief for all eligible farmers and
ranchers regardless of their lending institution," Boren said.
    Boren's statement received bipartisan support from Sen.
James McClure, R-Idaho, who agreed that the aid package should
cover all lenders to agriculture.
    The comments by Senators of both parties, plus endorsements
for the across-the-board approach from the nation's largest
farm organization, the American Farm Bureau Federation, and
from the system itself, appeared to significantly broaden the
focus of the rescue legislation for the farm credit system.
Until now, agriculture officials had focused exclusively on how
to resurrect the failing system.
    Boren said borrowers from private lenders such as
commercial banks and life insurance companies must be included
in the aid package because "it would not be fair to address
only the problems of Farm Credit System borrowers."
    However, Boren and other proponents of an across-the-board
interest rate or principal buydown did not say how much the
broad approach would cost.
    But Neil Harl, professor of economics at Iowa State
University told the hearing the cost could be in the range of
3.5 billion dlrs annually.
    By trying to draw into the farm credit rescue package all
farm borrowers, Boren and other Senators appeared to be
reacting to pressure from private lenders and their borrowers,
who fear they will be put at a competitive disadvantage by the
government rescue of the farm credit system and its borrowers.
    The farm credit system is the nation's largest lender to
agriculture with 39 pct of all farm real estate loans, but
private lenders account for nearly a quarter of loans on
farmland and 34 pct of farm operating loans, official figures
show.
    The American Bankers Association, in testimony to the
hearing, warned the farm credit rescue should not be structured
to favor the system over other lenders.
    As one way to meet the concern of private lenders, several
Senators, the farm credit system, and farm organizations
endorsed creation of a secondary market on farm real estate
loans, called "aggie mae", which is sought by private lenders.
    "We are also exploring the possibility of including in the
farm credit bill, the establishment of a secondary market for
agricultural loans that would be available to all lenders,"
Sen. Boren said.

Top executives with Tenneco Corp <TGT>
and Sabine Corp <SAB> said they expected world oil prices to
gradually increase over the next two years as U.S. reliance on
imports of oil from the Middle East grows.
     "I believe we have bottomed out and can look forward to a
trend of gradually increasing prices," C.W. Nance, president of
Tenneco Oil Exploration and Production, told a meeting of the
Petroleum Equipment Suppliers Association.
     Nance predicted that by 1990, the Organization of
Producing and Exporting Countries would be producing at the
rate of 80 pct of capacity.
    The gain will come largely through increased imports to the
United States, he said.
    "They will be able to raise the price again but I do not
think they will raise it as much as they did in 1979," Nance
said. He did not say how much of a price hike he expected.
     Andrew Shoup, chairman of Dallas-based Sabine, predicted
that world oil prices would increase from a range of 15 to 20
dlrs a barrel in 1987 to a range of 17 to 22 dlrs a barrel in
1988. Natural gas prices, Shoup said, should similarly climb
from a range of 1.30 to 1.70 dlrs per mcf this year to between
1.50 and 1.90 dlrs per mcf in 1988.
     "Fuel switching could help us as much as five pct in
increased demand," Shoup said, referring to the gas industry's
outlook for 1987. Repeal of the Fuel Use Act, a federal law
prohibiting the use of natural gas in new manufacturing plants
and utilities, could increase demand for gas by as much as 15
pct, he said.
     Tenneco's Nance also said that some U.S. cities may
experience peak day shortages in natural gas supplies next
winter because of the industry's reduced deliverability.
     Tenneco's gas deliverability, for example, dropped by 20
pct during 1986, he said.
     "This does not mean the gas bubble is gone," Nance said.
"We believe gas prices have bottomed out. The real question is
how broad the valley is -- is it one year, two years or three
years before we start to climb out?"
      J.C. Walter of <Walter Oil and Gas Corp>, said the recent
improvement in oil prices was not enough for independent
producers to begin new onshore drilling projects.
     "If crude oil stays below 20 dlrs a barrel and 1.50 dlr
per mcf for natural gas prevails, the prospects for onshore
exploration at deeper depths in the Texas Gulf Coast by
independents in the 1990s are pretty dismal," Walter said.
     He suggested that some independents may instead turn to
exploration in shallow federal offshore leases. Farm-out
agreements, cheap rig rates and less competition have held
finding costs in those areas to five or six dlrs a barrel,
Walter said.

Great American Corp said
preliminary findings by regulatory examiners of its AMBANK
subsidiary will result in a first quarter charge of 14.1 mln
dlrs and a writedown of 1.4 mln dlrs.
    The charge will be made against the allowance for possible
loan losses, and the writedown is of other real estate.
    Great American said the examiners were conducting a regular
examination and a final report is not expected for several
weeks. Management intends to include the charge and writedown
in response to the preliminary findings.
    Great American said regulatory authorities are not
requiring an adjustment of the previously reported financial
results for Great American for 1986.
    However, Great American has revised its previous estimates
of provisions for possible losses and has added 9.9 mln dlrs to
the allowance account as of December 31, 1986. It said it took
the action since the charge-offs will significantly deplete its
allowance for possible loan losses and the economic environment
does not show signs for significant improvement in the near
future.
    It said the additional provision increases the allowance to
26.4 mln dlrs, representing 6.63 pct of the outstanding loan
portfolio and 83.2 pct of non-performing loans at year-end.
    Great American said its revised net loss for the fourth
quarter is 14.1 mln dlrs, or 6.36 dlrs per share, compared to a
net loss of 2.4 mln dlrs or 1.06 dlrs per share the year

Senate Agriculture Committee
Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) said Congress would consider
limiting the use of generic commodity certificates as a means
of cutting government spending.
     "I suspect that as we go into some of the budget debates
we're going to have on the floor, this is going to be part of
it," Leahy said, referring to proposals that the U.S.
Agriculture Department save money by substituting cash outlays
for payment-in-kind, or PIK, certificates in price and income
support programs.
     "I have a feeling that the PIK program, however the cost
is defined, is going to be one of the top number of areas that
people are going to be looking for savings," Leahy told a
hearing of the Senate Agriculture Committee.
     The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the
government could save 1.4 billion dlrs during fiscal years
1988-92 if it curbed the use of generic certificates by banning
so-called "PIK and roll" transactions.
     Several Democratic senators had harsh comments for generic
certificates.
     "We're trying to take care of a bad situation --
surpluses--by depressing the price. I don't see any benefits,"
said Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa). "I don't see any benefit in
driving their prices lower, lower, lower all the time."
     But Sen. Rudy Boschwitz said he supported use of
certificates. "By and large I'm favorably impressed by PIK
certificates. I feel they have been helpful," said Boschwitz.
     As expected, officials from the General Accounting Office
and the U.S. Agriculture Department indicated their estimates
of the cost of PIK certificates compared to cash outlays were
far apart.
     The General Accounting Office, GAO, told the committee
that PIK certificates increased total Commodity Credit Corp
outlays through 1987 by between 107 mln and 653 mln dlrs. GAO
said that increase was offset by commodity storage cost savings
of beween 169 mln and 253 mln dlrs.
     Pressed by the committee, GAO Senior Associate Director
Brian Crowley said government spending probably was about 450
mln dlrs above what it would have been had all program payments
been made in cash, not counting storage savings.
     Crowley also said he thought PIK certificates had lowered
the price of corn and boosted domestic consumption of corn.
     Agriculture Undersecretary Daniel Amstutz told the
committee that the additional costs of using PIK certificates
and storage, handling and transportation costs "balance off
very closely."
     Amstutz said he estimated the net cost of using
certificates was about one pct higher than using only cash to
make program payments.
     William Bailey, USDA deputy administrator for program
planning, said there were "one hundred issues I find either
incorrect (in the GAO report), disagree with or where their
(GAO) facts are inconsistent with what's going on."
     Amstutz said GAO had not given USDA the option of
"providing input" into the preparation of their report "as they
frequently do."
     The USDA undersecretary also conceded that certificates
and marketing loans had the similar effect of "putting more
goods into the market," but that while the department supported
certificates, it would continue to oppose a marketing loan for
wheat and feedgrains because it would cost too much.

Federal Reserve data released today
indicate that there has been no policy change in recent weeks
and that none is likely at next week's Federal Open Market
Committee (FOMC) meeting, economists said.
    "The Fed continues to be accommodative in its provision of
reserves, indicating that there has been no policy shift since
the beginning of this year," said Harold Nathan, economist at
Wells Fargo Bank.
    "These numbers and other things suggest the FOMC will not
change policy," said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co.
    "The Fed is sitting fairly pretty now. There's no real
reason for it to change policy," said Joseph Liro of S.G.
Warburg and Co Inc.
    Liro said the economy is showing moderate growth and does
not require immediate policy easing and the money aggregates
may well end March at the bottom of their target ranges.
    All of the economists agreed that the Fed's major concern
now is recent weakness in the dollar which early this week was
heavily supported by central banks. They said fear of hurting
the dollar will cause the Fed to be cautious in lowering
interest rates further.
    Numbers released by the Fed today were all in line with
expectations and similar to the data for most of this year.
    The Fed said that banks' net free reserves averaged 603 mln
dlrs in the two-week statement period that ended on Wednesday
versus 749 mln dlrs in the previous period.
    In the single week to Wednesday, banks' borrowings at the
discount window, less extended credits, averaged 302 mln dlrs
compared with 228 mln dlrs in the first week of the statement
period. Meanwhile the Federal funds rate average edged up to
6.14 pct from 6.08 pct.
    The Fed's failure to add reserves in the market on Tuesday
and Wednesday surprised some, but economists said the data
released today suggest it had no real need to add reserves.
    The Fed's absence may be explained by the lack of any
pressing need for it to supply reserves and by a desire to
boost borrowings in the second week of the statement period to
meet its borrowings target, said Liro of Warburg.
    Liro said the Fed probably is shooting for a two-week
borrowings average of 300-325 mln dlrs. The borrowings actually
averaged 265 mln dlrs in the latest statement period and that
was up from 191 mln dlrs in the prior period.
    Brusca of Nikko agreed that the Fed probably is aiming for
two-week average discount window borrowings of around 300 mln
dlrs. He said that would correspond to a Federal funds rate of
around 6.10 pct.
    It is nearly impossible for the Fed to hit any borrowings
target since the demand for excess reserves is erratic, said
Wells Fargo's Nathan. He said the Fed is focusing instead on
the funds rate and is trying to keep it roughly within a six to
6-1/4 pct band.
    Upward funds rate pressure and a big reserve-adding need
are anticipated for the statement period that began today.
 More
    Brusca believes the Fed will have to add 3.5 to four
billion dlrs a day in reserves in this statement period. Liro
puts the add need at around 3.9 billion dlrs.
    To partly address this requirement, many expect the Fed to
add permanent reserves with effect next Thursday by offering to
buy all maturities of Treasury bills on Wednesday. A similar
coupon "pass" may be required later.
    There will be a greater demand for funds in this statement
period because it includes the close of the quarter. Further
upward pressure on the Federal funds rate may come from window
dressing demand as the Japanese fiscal year ends on March 31.

Substantial difficulties faced by the
U.S. farm credit system can be solved with a business-like
approach to the problems, a Farm Credit Admimistration official
said.
    Marvin R. Duncan, a member of the administration board,
said the farm credit system faces unprecedented difficulties in
its 70-year history.
    Addressing Chicago business and agricultural economists,
Duncan outlined three basic problems of the farm credit system.
Those include the high cost of its debt, the quality of its
assets, and the management of its credit delivery system.
    He said some of the system's debt carries interest rates as
high as 15.65 pct and will not mature until the year 2007.
    Of its 54.6 mln dlrs in assets, 24.1 pct are non-accrual,
high risk or already forfeited property, which led to losses in
1986 of 1.9 billion dlrs and in 1985 of 2.7 billion dlrs.
    Problems with credit delivery have been somewhat resolved,
he said.
    "The system is still plagued with duplication in layers of
management and decision-making, inadequate tailoring of credit
services to fit the emerging market, a large investment in
bricks and mortar, and a management and directorate more
insular to the marketplace than that of its competitors," he
said.
    He said solutions to the problems should -
 - provide assurances to farmers on borrowers stock and the
stability of the farm credit system.
 - maintain confidence of investors who buy system securities.
 - address the high cost of the system's existing debt.
 - enable the Farm Credit System Capital Corporation to carry
out its role as a workout bank.
    Frank Naylor, chairman of the Farm Credit Administration,
said this week that the system may lose as much as 1.4 billion
dlrs this year, and another board member, Jim Billington, said
Congress should plan to spend at least 800 mln dlrs beginning
late this year to bail out the system.
    Duncan noted that the system has about 70 billion dlrs in
assets, serves about 800,000 individual borrowers and 3,000
cooperatives, and has 62.5 billion dlrs in securities
outstanding.
    "With a business-like solution to its problems, it can
continue that role for generations into the future," he said.

Japan today announced another mammoth
monthly trade surplus that economists said would be sure to
intensify already mounting pressure on the country for action.
    "The world has every reason to be furious with Japan for not
moving more quickly," Jardine Fleming (Securities) Ltd economist
Eric Rasmussen said.
    The Finance Ministry said today that the trade surplus
soared to 8.14 billion dlrs in February from 5.7 billion in
January and 4.77 billion a year ago.
    The current account surplus, which includes trade in
services as well as goods, climbed to 7.38 billion dlrs last
month from 4.95 billion in January and 3.89 billion a year ago.
    After being adjusted for seasonal fluctuations, the figures
look a bit better, but not much. On that basis, the trade
surplus declined slightly in February to 9.16 billion dlrs from
a record 9.58 billion in January.
    "In the medium term we expect this modest improvement to
continue but the pace of progress may be too slow to ward off
further protectionism or further yen strength," said William
Stirling, economist at Merrill Lynch Japan Inc.
    A strong yen would make Japanese goods more expensive on
world markets while making imports into the country cheaper.
    "On a seasonally adjusted basis, we appear to be making some
progress on getting exports down," Jardine's Rasmussen said.
    But imports do not seem to be picking up much because the
Japanese economy remains sluggish, he said.
    Finance Ministry officials blamed last month's slower
import growth on a decline in oil imports as refiners worked
off stocks they had built up in January.
    The officials took comfort from a decline in the volume of
exports last month, after an unexpected year-on-year increase
in January.
    This means the effects of the two-year rise of the yen
against the U.S. Dollar are finally beginning to have an impact
on exports, they said.
    But economists warned that may not be soon enough for
Japan's trading partners.

The German auction system of shares
trading, retaining the business floor, can develop in parallel
to off-floor computer trading introduced in London in the "Big
Bang," Frankfurt stock exchange president Michael Hauck said.
    Hauck told a conference that it was unclear if the
Frankfurt floor would become superfluous. The Frankfurt
exchange did 55 pct of all German securities trading and was
investing 86 mln marks in renovating its building. A
screen-delivered in-house quotation system would soon be in
place too.
    The nature of the auction system limited how far trading
hours could be extended from the present two-hour session.
    Other practical problems inhibited the German ability to
follow London's moves. Official brokers, who set the prices,
were under the control of the Finance Ministry. This meant
transfer of securities control to an independent body, if
desired, would need legislative changes, Hauck said.
    "Shorting" stocks in Germany was also prohibited by the rules
for pension and insurance funds. They could thus not be lent
out for the kind of speculative positions taken by London
market makers.
    But Hauck said the system in London could be criticised for
being too distant from those it should serve.

World Bank President Barber Conable
called on Japan to boost investment in developing nations, for
its own sake as well as that of the world economy.
    "Japan has the means to make a major contribution to
development in the Third World," he told about 500 Japanese
businessmen and academics. "I would be pleased with additional
support."
    With 25 pct of the world's total banking assets, Japan
could do more to help assist indebted Third World countries
develop roads, bridges and other infrastructure, he said.
    Conable said additional commercial bank investment would
also be to Japan's advantage.
    It would profit from rechannelling its huge trade surplus
into Third World economies -- notably those in South America,
China and India -- that are likely to expand faster than those
in the developed world, he said.
    Japan is now the second largest shareholder in the Bank's
concessionary lending affiliate, the International Development
Association (IDA). It has also agreed recently to expand its
contribution to another affiliate, the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), Conable noted.
    Conable said the World Bank was expanding its structural
adjustment loans, designed to encourage developing countries to
open their economies more to free competition and trade.
    "Adjustment loans could rise to 30 pct (of total World Bank
loans) in the near future, though maybe not this year," Conable

The finance ministry appears ready to
allow Japanese financial institutions to use overseas financial
futures markets, a ministry official said.
    He declined to say when, but banking sources expect
approval as early as April. Banks, securities houses and
insurance companies are expected to become eligible to deal in
deposit, interest rate, bond and stock index futures.
    Ministry officials said they are wary of giving permission
to individuals or corporations because of their relative
inexperience.
    Broking for Japanese residents by financial institutions
would be prohibited as securities exchange laws bar banks from
doing this, the banking sources said.
    Overseas subsidiaries and branches of Japanese banks and
securities houses have already been allowed to use the overseas
futures markets on their own accounts.
    The Finance Ministry Ordinance based on Foreign Exchange
Administration Law will have to be revised to allow local
institutions to join the overseas markets, a ministry official
said.

Commercial Union Assurance <CUAC.L>, a
composite insurance company in the U.K., Said it is arranging a
financing facility totalling 750 mln European Currency Units
(ECUs) which will now include a medium term note program.
    Barry Cameron-Smail, Commercial Union's treasurer, said the
new financing will not increase its debt outstanding but rather
act as an umbrella for all its financing needs.
     Commercial Union has had a Euro-commercial paper program
since the autumn of 1985 and a guilder commercial paper program
since January 1986.
    Cameron-Smail said Commercial Union decided on having the
financing denominated in ECUs because it is more stable than
most major currencies, and because it would give greater
flexibility in its financings as it expands operations abroad.
    Although banks are anxious to develop a market for medium
term notes, only a few companies such as Electrolux AB and
Pepsico Inc have gone so far as to arrange one. Commercial
Union is the first U.K. Company to set up such a program.
    Cameron-Smail said the company seeks to help the
development of such a market as it would provide a new funding
base for its medium term assets.
     Cameron-Smail said that aside from traditional lines of
business, Commercial Union would like to move into other areas
where it may not be able to fund the assets itself. "This (the
medium term note program) will be the platform for developing
those assets," he said.
    He said Commercial Union will work closely with dealers for
the note program to find the right pricing level to satisfy
investor demands. The program will be investor driven, he
noted, adding that the company wants the notes placed with end
investors and not traded in the secondary market.
    Commercial Union will be able to issue medium term notes in
U.S. Dollars or sterling, with the dollar notes listed in
Luxembourg, while the sterling notes will be listed in London.
    Bankers expect that the maturities will be concentrated in
the one to five year area.
    The dealers for the program are Barclays de Zoete Wedd,
Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd, Goldman Sachs International,
Swiss Bank Corporation International Ltd and S.G. Warburg and
Co Ltd.

Westinghouse Electric Corp said
earnings per share growth will exceed sales growth and will be
in the double digit range through 1989.
    In 1986, the company earned 4.42 dlrs a share on revenues
of 10.7 billion dlrs.
    Speaking at a meeting for securities analysts, Douglas
Danforth, Westinghouse's chairman, said the company's sales
growth target is about 8.5 pct a year for 1988 and 1989, "given
an economic environment that remains on a moderate growth
course." He also said the company will make acquisitions, but
he did not specify particular targets.
    Paul E. Lego, senior executive vice president told the
analysts "our plans do not call for a multibillion dlr
acquisition, even though our balance sheet can handle one.
Despite this disclaimer, if we identify a major acquisition
that has significnt value-creating for Westinghouse...we will
consider it." He said the company would consider an acquisition
candidate that is in an area compatable with Westinghouse's
primiary businesses.
    Danforth said the corportation was focused in several key
areas including defense electronics, financial services,
broadcasting, electrical products and services for construction
and industrial and utility markets.
    Danforth added that he expects Westinghouse's sales to grow
faster than the markets the corportation serves and "surely
faster than GNP."
    He said earnings per share growth is expected to
consistently exceed the Standard and Poor's 500 index and
return on equity will remain in the 18 to 21 pct range.
    Leo W. Yochum, senior executive vice president for finance,
told the analysts "we will consider buying back stock" but
there are no current plans for such a buyback.
    Yochum said that at the company's current level of earnings
it could comfortably maintain higher debt levels and that
Westinghouse will use its debt capacity to improve shareholder
value.
    Last year, Westinghouse established a 790 mln dlrs
restructuring reserve to be used for plant consolodation,
assett writedowns and other items. Yochum said, the company
spent 306 mln dlrs of that reserve in 1986 and will spend 344
mln dlrs of the reserves in 1987. The balance will be used in
1988. He also said, capital expenditures should be about 400

The U.K. Treasury issued to the Bank of
England 250 mln stg in two tranches of existing index-linked
stocks, for first dealings on Monday, the Bank said.
    The issues are 150 mln stg of 2-1/2 pct index-linked
Treasury stock due 2011 and 100 mln of 2-1/2 pct index-linked
Treasury due 2024. The latter stock is free of tax to residents
abroad (FOTRA).
    The bonds will be available to the U.K. Government bond
market from Monday at certified prices of 113.00 stg pct for
the 2-1/2s of 2011 and 85-24/32 stg pct for the 2-1/2s of 2024.
    Several dealers had expected the Bank of England to
announce further issues of index-linked bonds today in the
light of strength seen in this sector of the market over the
past few days. Some prices advanced by as much as 1-1/2 points
yesterday as the rest of the market eased back further.
    However, one or two traders expressed surprise that the
authorities had issued further bonds of any kind in the light
of the nervous conditions prevailing in the market.
    In such relatively small amounts, the new issues were
unlikely to have a significantly harmful effect on Government
bond prices in general, dealers said.

Galactic Resources
Ltd, earlier reporting a 1986 loss of 25.6 mln U.S. dlrs, said
it adopted a more conservative accounting policy, similar to
other gold producers' accounting for exploration costs.
    As a result, the company retroactively charged all past
exploration and related administration costs incurred on its
properties against expenses in 1986, 1985 and 1984.
    Under the new policy, all future exploration and related
administration costs will be written off to expenses rather
than capitalized as an intangible asset, it said.
    Galactic said the accounting change resulted in a 22.8 mln
U.S. dlr charge against 1986 earnings. It did not immediately
disclose the affect of the change on prior years' results.
    The new accounting policy is not expected to adversely
affect working capital position, future cash flows or the
company's ability to conduct ongoing business operations, it
said.
    Galactic said the charge includes 9.9 mln U.S. dlrs of
costs concerning its Summitville Mine leach pad and 8.9 mln
U.S. dlrs in waste removal costs, dyke construction and other
mine developments.
    Galactic said under the prior accounting policy, the
Summitville mine expenses would have been amortized over the
life of the mine and charged against future earnings.
    The change will also result in lower depreciation and
amortization charges against income of about 52 U.S. dlrs an
ounce of gold produced in future periods, based on total
estimated reserves of 617,000 ounces.
    Galactic said March leaching production at Summitville is
expected to exceed 2,500 ounces, raising gold equivalent
production since the June 5, 1986 start of leaching to 65,000
ounces.

Honeywell Inc said it has
completed the sale of 57.5 pct of its Honeywell Information
Systems <HIS> computer business to <Compagnie des Machines
Bull> of France and <NEC Corp> of Japan for 527 mln dlrs in
cash.
    Honeywell said it will use much of the money to reduce
short-term debt incurred last December when the company
purchased the Sperry Aerospace Group.
    Honeywell said the sale of HIS has created a new dedicated
computer company jointly owned by Bull, NEC and Honeywell.
    The new privately held company, named Honeywell Bull, is
42.5 pct owned by Honeywell Inc, 42.5 pct by Bull and 15 pct by
NEC, the new company said.
    Honeywell added that terms of the agreement with NEC and
Bull allow it to reduce its current 42.5 pct stake in the new
company to 19.9 pct at the end of 1988 by selling just over
half its shares to Bull. Book value at the time will determine
the move's pricing, Honeywell said.
    Honeywell chairman and chief executive officer, Edson
Spencer, said the move is the last major step in Honeywell's
restructuring.
    "As the leading worldwide supplier of of automation and
controls for buildings, industry, aerospace and defense,
Honeywell is now focusing its management, technical and
financial resources on high market share business," Spencer
said.
    Honeywell said it expects to be Honeywell Bull's largest
customer, purchasing computers for its own internal data
processing, for integration into Honeywell buidling and
industrial automation systems and for resale to the U.S.
governement.
    Honeywell said HIS's Federal Systems Division is now a
wholly owned unit of Honeywell Inc, and has been named
Honeywell Federal Systems Inc.
    Honeywell said it accounted for HIS as a discontinued
operation in 1986, and will account for its future interest on
a cost basis, recording any dividends as received.
    Honeywell Bull said it will continue to develop its product
line and build its business in integrated systems for
networking, database management and transaction processing.
    The new company said its board will have nine members,
including the chairman and chief executive officer.
    Bull will have four members, Honeywell two and NEC one, the
new company, which began worldwide operations today, said.
    It added that Jacques Stern, Bull's chairman and chief
executive officer, will serve as Honeywell Bull's chairman of
the board, while Jerome Meyer, formerly executive vice

The Agriculture Department's
widening of Louisiana gulf differentials will affect county
posted prices for number two yellow corn in ten states, a USDA
official said.
    All counties in Iowa will be affected, as will counties
which use the gulf to price corn in Illinois, Indiana,
Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama
and Louisiana, said Ron Burgess, Deputy Director of Commodity
Operations Division for the USDA.
    USDA last night notified the grain industry that effective
immediately, all gulf differentials used to price interior corn
would be widened on a sliding scale basis of four to eight cts,
depending on what the differential is.
    USDA's action was taken to lower excessively high posted
county prices for corn caused by high gulf prices.
    "We've been following this Louisiana gulf situation for a
month, and we don't think it's going to get back in line in any
nearby time," Burgess said.
    Burgess said USDA will probably narrow back the gulf
differentials when and if Gulf prices recede. "If we're off the
mark now because we're too high, wouldn't we be as much off the
mark if we're too low?" he said.
    While forecasting more adjustments if Gulf prices fall,
Burgess said no other changes in USDA's price system are being
planned right now.
    "We don't tinker. We don't make changes lightly, and we
don't make changes often," he said.

    The date on which the new rules will take effect has not

force early next week, after which the buffer stock manager can
begin buying or selling cocoa.
    Since prices are below the "may-buy" level of 1,655 Special

likely to buy cocoa sooon to support the market, they said.
    Delegates and traders said they expected the manager,
Juergen Plambeck, to intervene in the market within three weeks
of the pact coming into force.
    The rules permit him to buy and sell cocoa from origins or
the second hand market on an offer system, not by means of a
posted price as in the previous cocoa accord.
    The cocoa will be priced according to a fixed set of
differentials, ranging from 137 stg for most expensive Ghana
cocoa to zero for Malaysian cocoa.
    Purchases from non-members, such as Malaysia, will be
limited to 15 pct of the total stock and those on any one day
should be limited to 40 pct each in nearby, intermediate and
forward positions.
    The council meeting, which is expected to conclude two
weeks of sessions involving various working groups and the

U.S. cotton farmers are likely to
plant about 10.6 mln acres in the coming season, based on an
average of estimates offered by cotton market analysts gearing
up for the U.S. Agriculture Department's 1987 planting
intentions report next Tuesday.
    The annual report gives cotton traders their first glimpse
of what U.S. production might be in the 1987/88 season, which
begins August 1.
    Trade and commission house forecasts ranged from 10.2 to
10.9 mln acres.
    On March 18 of last year, the USDA reported that cotton
farmers in 1986 intended to plant 9.71 mln acres.
    Four months later, the USDA estimated that 9.67 mln acres
had been planted as of June 1. By January, its estimate of 1986
planted acreage nationwide was 10.06 mln.
    Analysts said their forecasts for even greater acreage in
1987 were spurred in part by belief that this year's good
demand and firm prices will be repeated next year. Analysts
said those factors make cotton a profitable crop.
    "With cotton more attractive price-wise, I think there is
going to be a switch in acreage from soybeans to cotton.
Soybeans are dirt cheap," said Lisbeth Keefe of Cargill
Investor Services, whose comments were echoed by other cotton
market specialists.
    Changes in the U.S. cotton program also could lead to
increased acreage, analysts said.
    They recalled that under the 1986 program, cotton farmers
who used part of their crop as collateral for government loans
were not responsible for the cost of storing that cotton in
government warehouses. But under the 1987 plan, the government
will not pick up the tab for storage.
    Analysts said the change will discourage some farmers from
participating in the program, which could result in more
cotton. "The cotton program stipulates a mandatory set-aside of
25 pct of a farmer's base acreage," noted Judy Weissman of
Shearson Lehman Brothers. But farmers who elect not to
participate in the program are free to plant all the acreage 
they have.
    Some analysts said cotton farmers in the high-yielding
Western states would be most likely to steer clear of the
program. "Western acreage should be up at least 20 pct," said
one commission house analyst, whose estimate was based in part
on forecasts made by the National Cotton Council during its
annual meeting in late January.
    But others disagreed. "I think some Western growers have
decided they should be in the program for security reasons.
There's a lot of comfort in knowing you'll be guaranteed the
government's loan price of 52.25 cents a lb. Anyone outside the
program is subject to the wiles of the market," said Walter
Brown, market analyst for a major California cotton producer.
    Some cotton specialists said their expectations for
increased acreage might not be verified in Tuesday's planting
intentions report. "Anything the USDA is announcing now is
based on information they gathered before their cotton program
was announced (on March 20)," one analyst cautioned. She said
traders will get a better idea of next year's cotton output
when the USDA's planted acreage report is released on July 9.
    Brown took that opinion a step further. "I don't think
planted acreage is important. What counts is the abandonment
rate," the difference between acreage planted and acreage
harvested.
    Brown said the abandonment rate this year was "pretty high"
at 15.5 pct because of weather problems in key producing
states. "More normal would be about six pct," he said.

    Honeywell Bull president Jerome Meyer also told the press

    Honeywell Inc earlier today received 527 mln dlrs in cash
for the sale of 57.5 pct of its computer business to Bull and
NEC. Honeywell will retain a 42.5 pct interest in Honeywell
Bull and Bull will own an equal amount.
    NEC owns 15 pct of the company.
    Meyer, who had been executive vice president of Honeywell
Information Systems, said Honeywell Bull would work closely
with NEC and Bull in both developing new products and marketing
computers to multi-national companies.
    "We haven't been growing as fast as we'd like, but we are
going to turn that around," Meyer said. He said business was

    He said the company was reorganizing its distribution
programs and its staff, reassigning and laying off selected

growing market for companies that provide the type of computers
customers want. "I don't believe in the slump of the market,"
he said.

Latest consumer price data indicate
U.S. inflation will be moderate in 1987 even though it will be
above last year's pace, economists said.
    "Inflation is not such a constructive factor as this time
last year, but it's not building up a large head of steam,"
said Allan Leslie of Discount Corp.
    U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the consumer price
index for all urban consumers, rose a seasonally adjusted 0.4
pct in February after a 0.7 pct January gain. Energy prices,
which fired January's data with a three pct rise, advanced a
more moderate 1.9 pct last month.
    The CPI came within the range of economists' expectations
and had little direct impact on U.S. financial markets.
    Among the key components of the report, transportation
prices rose 0.5 pct in February after a 1.5 pct January gain
reflecting smaller price appreciation for motor fuels and
declines in new car prices and finance charges.
    "There are no pronounced pressures at the retail level,"
said William Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
    Economists said the latest CPI supports existing
expectations for an inflation rate of 3.5 to four pct in 1987.
    The CPI rose 1.1 pct from December 1985 to December 1986.
Without last year's energy price drop, it rose 3.8 pct.
    Economists said that upward pressure on import prices as a
result of the dollar's drop as well as the volatile energy
component warrant attention in case gains in these areas become
factored into the wider economic picture.
    "As long as those price rises do not become entrenched in
cost of living adjustments contained in labor contracts, thus
reducing international competitiveness, then the Federal
Reserve would probably be willing to tolerate four pct
inflation," said Larry Leuzzi of S.G. Warburg and Co Inc.

The federal Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) is expected to announce soon that it will
require an additional review of Genentech Inc's TPA heart drug,
a move that likely will delay the company's plans to
market the drug this spring, government and Wall Street sources
said.
    TPA, a bio-engineered blood-clot dissolving drug which
Genentech hopes to market under the name Activase, will be
reviewed by the FDA's cardiorenal advisory committee during the
panel's May 28-29 meeting, the sources said.
    Neither Genentech nor the FDA would confirm that a second
review of the drug had been set.
    "It's under consideration for the May 28-29 meeting," an FDA
official said. "It's on a draft agenda."
    Similarly, a Genentech spokeswoman said the FDA had not yet
notified it of the second advisory committee review.
    "We know it's a possibility, but as of this minute, we can't
confirm that we are on the agenda," she said.
    The spokeswoman said a second review had "always been a
possibility." But she declined to say how the review would
affect marketing plans before receiving official FDA word.
    The spokeswoman acknowledged that rumors of a second FDA
committee review had buffeted Genentech's stock yesterday on
Wall Street. The stock fell 2.75 dlrs a share to clsoe at 61.75
dlrs.
    TPA stands for tissue plasminogen activator, and would be
used on heart attack victims to clear blockage in a vein or
artery. Though other blood clot dissolvers are on the market,
TPA is said to be more effective and with fewer side effects.

low pressure area over southeast Colorado which could stall the
system.
    If impeded by the low-pressure area, the cold air could hit
Oklahoma and Texas as late as Monday morning. Temperatures
could stay in the mid-20's for up to eight hours, Mohler said.
    Krenzler said less than 10 pct of the Oklahoma wheat crop
has advanced to boot stage. The closer to that stage the more
vulnerable the head of the wheat is to cold weather, he said.
    "We can handle probably an hour or so down to 25 or 26
degrees (fahrenheit)," Krenzler said, "as long as we don't have
a lot of wind."
    "If we do get six hours down below 25 degrees I'd say we
have a good chance of significant damage to the heads," he
said.
    Krenzler said early planted stands in the north-central and
southwestern parts of the state are probably most vulnerable.
Crops in the panhandle of Oklahoma and Texas are less developed
and have some snow cover protection from the cold, he noted.

McLean Industries Inc said its
two shipping subsidiaries -- UNITED States Lines Inc and United
States Lines (S.A.) Inc -- have agreed in principle to dispose
of substantially all their remaining operating shipping assets.
    The units have been operating under protection of Chapter
11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code since last November.
    McLean said U.S. Lines has a letter of intent with CSX
Corp's <CSX> Sea-Land Corp subsidiary to transfer assets of its
Transpacific/Hawaii/Guam Service to Sea-Land.
    McLean said Sea-Land has tentatively agreed to pay 125 mln
dlrs for six vessels, certain port facilities, and various
other equipment used in U.S. Lines' Transpacific service and
theree Lancer class vessels and subsidy rights owned by the two
McLean subsidiaries.
    As previously announced, U.S. Lines (S.A.) will transfer
its South American Service to <Crowley Maritime Corp>'s
American Transport Lines Inc subsidiary in return for a fixed
lease payment for the four Lancer class vessels and a
participation based on American Transport's South American
revenues.
    McLean said the agreement also calls for Crowley to release
U.S. Lines (S.A.) for any damages and unpaid charter hire for
three vessels leased to U.S. Lines (S.A.) by Crowley which have
been returned to Crowley.
    McLean said the minimum lease payments will be seven mln
dlrs and estimated revenue participation during the first four
years at about 16 mln dlrs. In addition, U.S. Lines (S.A.)
subsidiaries in Brazil and Argentina will be sold to American
Transport.
    The company said both agreements in principle have been
approved by directors of the companies involved, but still need
court, regulatory and lender approval.
    McLean said it is requesting the bankruptcy court to
schedule a hearing on its motion to approve the agreements,
adding that the court has granted the company's request to
extend for 90 days the period for the shipping companies to
file a proposed plan of reorganization.
    It said the planned transactions will leave McLean with no
significant shipping assets except 12 New York class vessels,
which are not in operation and are expected to be sold.
    McLean said its shipping units are returning the vessels
operating in foreign commerce to United States ports to permit
the planned transfer to purchasers.
    The company said U.S. Lines will maintain its weekly
service from the U.S. West Coast to Hawaii and Guam until the
vessels are transferred and the transaction is completed.

The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME)
has proposed stringent limits on the portion of futures trading
that can be conducted between "trading rings," or  affiliated
groups of floor brokers, according to a CME spokesman.
    Violators would be subject to fines of as much as 50,000
dlrs, the exchange said in a letter distributed to its members
earlier this week.
    The proposal is one of the reforms the exchange's Board of
Governors suggested to curb practices that have come under fire
for unfairly limiting competition on the floor. Local traders
claim that trading among broker "rings" violates the
open-outcry system prevailing in the futures markets.
    Limits on ring trading would be applied floor-wide under
the proposal. The other reforms, which address dual trading,
would apply only to the Standard and Poor's 500 stock index
futures pit.
    A debate over dual trading, the practice of trading for
one's own account and filling customer orders, has arisen
because many traders believe it can create a climate for
trading abuses, especially in the extremely volatile stock
index futures pit.
    Adoption of the Board of Governors' reforms hinges on an
April 13 vote of CME members on a membership petition, signed
by several hundred members in February, that would bar all dual
trading at the exchange.

The average weekly earnings of U.S.
workers after adjustment for inflation and seasonal changes
rose 0.6 pct in February after being unchanged in January, the
Labor department said.

unchanged.
    Between February this year and February, 1986, real
earnings rose 0.5 pct, the department said.
    The rise in February real earnings resulted from a 0.5 pct
increase in average hourly earnings and a 0.6 pct increase in
average weekly hours. That was partly offset by a 0.4 pct rise
in the consumer price index, which measures inflation, the
department said.

Fueled by an earnings-driven bull
market, food stocks are emerging as the big winners, analysts
say.
    "This is an earnings-driven market, and the investor is
homing in on stocks that have visible and predictable earnings
growth," E.F. Hutton food analyst June Page said.
    The food group, whose stocks have underperformed since the
beginning of the year after about five years of growth, seems
to have turned around, DLJ Securities analyst William Leach
agreed.
    The fundamentals remain favorable and may even be enhanced
by the effects of tax reform for companies such as Sara Lee
Corp <SLE>, Quaker Oats Co <OAT>, and General Mills Inc <GIS>,
Page said. These and other food companies are recommended as
aggressive buys on a selective basis by most brokerage houses
surveyed.
    The current economy provides an environment of stable
inflation, interest rates and energy costs, which gives food
companies the flexibility to expand profit margins over a
period of time, Page said. Lower commodity costs allow for
further price flexibility, she added.
    Another plus is that increases in labor and packaging in
the food industry have been minimal, she noted.
    For 1987, Page said E.F. Hutton sees inflation holding
under four pct, oil prices stabilizing at 17 to 18 dlrs a
barrel and interest rates remaining at current levels.
    As a result of new production facilities featuring
sophisticated technology "companies now have a lower breakeven
point because they have enhanced productivity and lower
overhead costs," she said.
    Unit volume growth has accelerated in the past several
years in the food industry due to product segmentation, that

An error interrupted testing of an Ariane
rocket third stage starter motor on Monday but there should be
little or no delay in the launch program, Arianespace said.
    A joint statement from the European Arianespace consortium
and the motor manufacturer Societe Europeenne de Propulsion
(SEP) said that to avoid any risk, the motor had been
dismantled and could not be used in the next launch.
    It had immediately been replaced by another motor and new
tests had begun today.
    "In these conditions, the flight V19 remains scheduled
before the end of June," the statement said.
    Ariane launches have been suspended since an ignition
failure in the third stage motor last May forced controllers to
blow up a rocket in flight.
    SEP has been carrying out a series of nearly 50
simulated-altitude tests on the redesigned starter at its
tightly guarded plant in the town of Vernon, 80 km northwest of
Paris.
    The Arianespace-SEP statement said that during a test on
March 23, a fault in the preparation of the altitude simulation
chamber meant a component of the motor came under abnormal
pressure.
    Arianespace originally hoped to resume launches by February
this year, but a longer-than-expected test program on the new
starter motor forced postponement of the next launch.
    The total orderbook of outstanding launches for the
13-member European Space Agency's Ariane rockets runs to more
than 40 satellites and is worth more than two billion dlrs.
    The Ariane program is the main rival to the United States'
NASA agency in the lucrative satellite launch market. Its
orders have sharply increased largely as a result of the U.S.
Space shuttle disaster in January 1986.

Bank fuer Gemeinwirtschaft AG
<BKFG.F>, BfG, partial operating profits fell to 182.6 mln
marks in 1986 from 313.7 mln in 1985, new majority shareholder
Aachener und Muenchener Beteiligungs-AG <AMVG.F>, AMB, said.
    But total operating and extraordinary profits, including
earnings from currency and securities trading on the bank's own
account and earnings from the sale of holdings in other firms,
were more than double the previous year's level, AMB said.
    BfG's 1986 accounts were included in a prospectus for AMB's
capital increase, which is to finance the insurance company's
acquisition of 50 pct plus one share of BfG.
    Despite the fall in partial operating profits, BfG paid an
unchanged 20 mln marks into open reserves and transferred an
unchanged 80 mln marks to its trade union holding company,
<Beteiligungsgesellschaft fuer Gemeinwirtschaft AG>, from which
AMB has acquired the majority stake.
    The bank has said its business last year suffered from the
turbulence around the troubled trade-union-owned housing
concern Neue Heimat.
    AMB said the 500 mln mark drop in BfG's business volume to
50.1 billion marks affected the interest surplus.
    The interest surplus, which fell to 897.9 mln marks from
981.1 mln, was also depressed by the 0.1 point fall in the
interest margin to 1.9 pct.
    A rise in the surplus on commission to 208.8 mln marks from
188.1 mln was not enough to compensate for this.
    The rise in total operating profits enabled BfG to step up
risk provisions, with country risks particularly emphasised
because of the continuing difficulties of some countries.
    Disclosed risk provisions, which under West German
accounting rules do not necessarily reflect the full amount,
rose to 736.3 mln marks from 224.0 mln.
    BfG's parent credit volume eased to 32.63 billion marks in
1986 from 33.51 billion. Foreign debtors accounted for 24 pct
of this credit volume, and Latin American debtors accounted for
14.7 pct of total lending to foreigners.
    BfG posted extraordinary earnings from the sale of 25.01
pct of <Volksfuersorge Deutsche Lebensversicherung AG>, 74.9
pct of <BSV Bank fuer Sparanlagen und Vermoegensbildung AG> and
five pct of <Allgemeine Hypothekenbank AG>. The sale was linked
to AMB's acquisition of a majority of BfG.
    These sales show up as 494.2 mln marks from profit transfer
agreements and 326.5 mln from writing back risk provisions.

exchange rates and economic and financial conditions both in

because the dollar had fallen too far, Sumita said he still
thought the pact was a good one in the sense that it had
corrected the overvaluation of the dollar. But the Plaza accord
did not set any target for the dollar's fall, he said.
    The dollar's steep fall stems from the market's belief that

    Poindexter resigned as head of the National Security

disclosed he was aware part of the profits from the arms sales
were diverted to contra rebels in Nicaragua.
    The report in Time quoted unnamed friends of Poindexter's

kept the president adequately informed.
    "Indeed, he is likely to testify that on at least two
occasions in 1986, he told Reagan in general terms that the
contras were being helped as an ancillary or side benefit of
the arms deal with Iran," Time said.

diversion of arms sales profits to the contras.

An investor group trying to acquire
GenCorp Inc said it would move to unseat the board of directors
and take other action if GenCorp refuses to discuss a 2.3
billion dlr takeover bid.
    General Acquisition Co, a partnership of Wagner and Brown
and AFG Industries Inc <AFG>, reiterated in a statement sent to
GenCorp on Friday that it was willing to negotiate its earlier
offer of 100 dlrs a share for the tire, broadcasting, plastics
and aerospace conglomerate.
    Analysts have speculated GenCorp could fetch at least 110
to 120 dlrs per share if broken up.
    GenCorp officials declined to comment on the statement, but
a spokesman reiterated a request to shareholders to wait until
the board renders an opinion before making a decision on the
offer. GenCorp has said a statement would be made on or before
the company's annual meeting on Tuesday.
    General Acquisition said the board could not carry out its
duties to shareholders and make an informed decision until it
has, "... Explored with us the ways in which our offer can be
revised to provide greater value to your shareholders."
    General Acquisition added it was aware the board may be
reviewing alternative transactions, which might provide GenCorp
shareholders with a payment other than cash.
    "If that is the case, you should recognise that our
additional equity capital may very well enable us to offer cash
and securities having greater value than GenCorp could provide
in any similarly structured transaction," it said.
    It added GenCorp's board had an obligation to present any
alternative proposal to shareholders in a way that allowed
competing offers.
    General Acquisition requested it be given a chance to bid
on a competitive and fair basis before any final decision was
made on any other buyout proposal.
    The statement repeated the request GenCorp remove a "poison
pill" preferred share purchase rights to shareholders, making
any takeover more expensive.
    It said it might take legal action, or seek the support of
shareholders in calling a special meeting to replace the board
and consider other proposals.
    GenCorp should not accept any other proposal containing
defensive features, it said.

The Finance Ministry is trying to
eliminate technical obstacles so as to encourage purchases of
Japanese Treasury bills by foreign governments and central
banks, in order to increase overseas holdings of yen assets, a
senior Finance Ministry official said.
    The official declined to give details but securities
sources said they expect the 16 pct withholding tax on T-bills
to be repaid immediately when governments and central banks buy
bills. The current practice of filing tax redemption claims is
time consuming, they said.
    Securities houses here have had difficulty selling
six-month debt-financing paper, called tankoku, to overseas
governments and central banks because of the tax system and the
Bank of Japan's book entry system, which demands the accounts
be kept with the houses rather than by the Bank.
    Tankoku, introduced in February 1986, were designed as a
key short-term instrument to promote internationalization of
the yen. But since the introduction of a complicated book-entry
system for bill purchases in January 1986, foreign governments
and central banks have shied away from buying the bills, the
sources said.
    Foreign governments and central banks are therefore
expected to be allowed to hold their accounts at the Bank of
Japan, the securities sources said.
    Relevant measures are likely to be announced at the next
U.S.-Japan yen-dollar committee meeting on the deregulation of
Tokyo's financial market, expected in May, they said.

BASF AG said
the volatile currency situation last year, particularly the
fall of the dollar, led to sharp drops in turnover denominated
in marks and to price reductions for exports from domestic
production.
    But in a statement accompanying year-end figures, the group
said it expected satisfactory business development over the
next months. "At the moment we do not expect any extraordinary
influences such as there were last year," it said. Orders in
hand and incoming orders were steady at a high level.
    BASF reported 13.6 pct lower 1986 world group pre-tax
profit at 2.63 billion marks compared to 1985.
    The unusual situation on the crude oil market last year
also produced a clear sales slide in the oil and gas sector and
forced price declines for petrochemical products, BASF said.
    The fall in pre-tax profit corresponded to the losses on
stocks in the oil and gas sector at the beginning of 1986. In
the parent company, the positive earnings development
continued, it said, where pre-tax profit rose by 3.2 pct to
1.97 billion marks. The decline in parent company turnover was
balanced out by increased capacity use and price declines in
raw materials. 
    In 1986, world group turnover was off 8.8 pct at 40.47
billion marks compared to 1985, BASF said. Parent turnover fell
8.5 pct to 18.72 billion.
    Turnover increases, with the exceptions of the sectors fine
chemicals and informations systems, had only been achieved in
those areas widened last year through acquisition in 1985.
    Results from these had been taken only partly into the
fourth quarter of that year but fully included in 1986 data.
    So far in the current year, the investment volume of the
parent company and the world group is exceeding that in 1986,
BASF said, without giving concrete figures.

designed to help the industry regroup and shed 20 pct of
capacity by March 31, 1988, Transport Ministry officials said.
    The cartel, comprising 33 yards capable of constructing
ships of more than 10,000 gross tonnes, will limit newbuilding
output to a maximum of three mln compensated gross registered
tonnes in 1987/88, the Shipbuilders Association of Japan said.
    Industry sources said the 33 will seek to renew the cartel
in 1988/89 in the belief demand will remain sluggish.
    Last week's temporary act of parliament also allows
shipbuilders to receive favourable taxation terms plus up to 50
billion yen in compensation for liabilities incurred through
job losses and the sale of excess capacity.
    Up to 30 billion yen has been allocated for purchasing
redundant land and equipment from shipbuilders.

Call money rose to 3.70/80 pct from
3.50/60 pct in moderate business as liquidity drained from the
system on pension payments by insurance firms, dealers said.
    But the market was relatively liquid for the month's end,
when rates usually tighten, dealers said. Call money was still
at or slightly below the 3.80 pct rate set on the most recent
Bundesbank securities repurchase offer last week.
    The insurances would probably draw down some 11 billion
marks for pension payments. But part of this would be offset by
an estimated five to six billion marks flowing in from treasury
bills bought from the Bundesbank on Thursday, dealers said. 
    Rates could ease later in the week as bank customers
deposit part of their pension payments back with the banks
tomorrow and Wednesday, and banks face reserve requirements for
a new month, dealers said.
    On Thursday, banks' actual daily reserve holdings fell to
43.3 billion marks, down substantially from 49.1 billion on
Wednesday. But the daily average holdings for the first 25 days
of the month stood at 51.8 billion marks, well above the
required daily average net reserve holdings of 50.7 billion.    
The Bundesbank has not scheduled a securities repurchase
tender this week, since there is no expiring prior pact. 
dealers said liquidity was adequate without the addition of new
repo funding.
    If tightness does occur the Bundesbank may add short-term
temporary federal government funds to counteract this. The last
such liquidity injection was carried out as call money rates

    The strong recovery of the first six months continued into

Government. It stated that its John Carr unit benefitted from

Vermoegensholding> which owns 37.5 pct of Sachs AG, which in
turn holds 96.5 pct of Fichtel und Sachs. The MEC shares will

    In addition to these firm agreements, Mannesmann is also
talking with the state-owned steel group Salzgitter AG

    Earlier this month Mannesmann disclosed that it might want
a majority stake in Sachs after previously saying it was
seeking to buy only a minority holding in the company, which
has annual turnover of 2.2 billion marks and employs 17,000.
    The acquisition is part of Mannesmann's efforts to

British and Commonwealth Shipping Co Plc
<BCOM.L> said that it would reorganise its commercial and
service operations into a single public grouping with
autonomous management.
    The group has expanded rapidly in the past year through the
672.5 mln stg acquisition of <Exco International Plc> and 90
mln bid for <Steel Brothers Holdings Plc>.
    It noted that its operations were now divided between
financial services, including money broking, investment
management and forfaiting, and more traditional areas such as
aviation, hotels, commodity trading and office equipment.
    It said that each sector had exciting prospects but
required different methods of management and financing.
    B and C planned to form a new public company to hold the
commercial operations and envisaged it operating with a capital
of between 400 mln and 600 mln stg.

introduction of independent investors to subscribe for
additional capital, and believes that the proportion of equity
capital held by outside investors would not exceed 20 pct of

    The statement said that with the continued support of B and
C, together with outside capital, the new grouping would emerge
as a major group in its own right with the ability to take

The Finance Ministry is trying to
eliminate technical obstacles so as to encourage purchases of
Japanese Treasury bills by foreign governments and central
banks, in order to increase overseas holdings of yen assets, a
senior Finance Ministry official said.
    The official declined to give details but securities
sources said they expect the 16 pct withholding tax on T-bills
to be repaid immediately when governments and central banks buy
bills. The current practice of filing tax redemption claims is
time consuming, they said.
    Securities houses here have had difficulty selling
six-month debt-financing paper, called tankoku, to overseas
governments and central banks because of the tax system and the
Bank of Japan's book entry system, which demands the accounts
be kept with the houses rather than by the Bank.
    Tankoku, introduced in February 1986, were designed as a
key short-term instrument to promote internationalization of
the yen. But since the introduction of a complicated book-entry
system for bill purchases in January 1986, foreign governments
and central banks have shied away from buying the bills, the
sources said.
    Foreign governments and central banks are therefore
expected to be allowed to hold their accounts at the Bank of
Japan, the securities sources said.
    Relevant measures are likely to be announced at the next

When the largest German "universal"
banks begin announcing 1986 results this week they should
report the third consecutive record year. But prospects for
1987 and beyond would be distinctly cloudier, bank analysts
said.
    Results should show the trend which began this decade was
unbroken. The proportion of earnings gleaned from commission
business should be higher, while the role played by the more
traditional credit lending business would show further erosion.
    Stock exchange volumes remained high last year, depite only
modest share index rises in the year.
 In addition, major banks last year were very active in new
bourse flotations and primary and secondary bond market
business, banking analysts said.
    Despite last week's quite strong rally, the depressed stock
market and forecasts that it would probably not attract
sustained interest from the global investment community made a
downturn in commission business most likely.
    Pressure on the interest rate margin and the increasing
competition posed not only by foreign banks in Germany but by
foreign stock exchanges, particularly London, would also bring
more guarded prognoses for the future from board members.
    But one banking analyst said, "There's obviously no reason
to paint too dark a picture. In this decade so far, the banks
have posted practically only record profits, with increases of
50 pct and more. This cycle must clearly end sometime."
    One problem more psychological than real was West German
banks' exposure to Latin American debtor nations. Bank
officials have said that a good 70 pct of the exposure has been
written off on balance sheets.
    Some analysts consider that the conservative accounting of
German banks may in some cases have prompted the writedown of
80 or even 100 pct of several exposures there.
    With almost all Latin American exposure denominated in dlrs
and written down two or three years ago, the U.S. Currency's
fall has made further allocations to country risk reserves for
the region virtually unnecessary.
    "German bank earnings have become much more dependent on
developments on the stock exchange than on the debt question," a
second analyst said.
    It is precisely because of bank reporting rules that allow
the build up of "hidden" reserves known only to the Bundesbank,
that few analysts produced precise earnings forecasts as they
did for corporate non-banks.
    But Alastair France, of London brokers Alexanders, Laing &
Cruickshank, said his clculations showed that Deutsche Bank AG
<DBKG.F> would report a very strong 1986, boosted&by
&#127;herMdbs&#127;oa&#127; &#127;Z the FriedrichFlick &#127;nd&#127;st&#127;ieve&#127;waltung KGAA
industrial empire, followed by a fairly strong drop back this
year and flat earnings in 1988.
    This contrasted with Dresdner Bank AG <DRSD.F> and
Commerzbank AG <CBKG.F> whose earnings would drift fractionally
lower this year and then rise modestly in 1988. On the German
DVFA basis, Deutsche should report 59 marks per share in 1986
and 49 marks in both ensuing years, France said.

The Philadelphia Stock Exchange (PHLX),
a leading trader of currency options, plans to extend its
trading hours to serve Australasian and Far Eastern markets,
exchange president Nicholas Giordano said.
    He told reporters the PHLX will open a new session between
1900 and 2300 hours U.S. EST from the beginning of the third
quarter this year.
    The PHLX is also opening an office in Hong Kong to serve
clients in the region and educate financial markets about the
advantages of currency options, Giordano said.
    Giordano was in Sydney to start an Asian-Pacific tour by
exchange executives promoting the hedging benefits of the
exchange-trade currency option market against existing
over-the-counter option trading during the local working day.
    Currency options pioneered by the PHLX in 1982 had become
an accepted means of hedging against foreign exchange risk and
had grown in popularity, he said.
    The PHLX now offered options in eight currencies, including
a new Australian dollar option, and traded an average 42,000
contracts daily with underlying open interest of more than 30
billion U.S. Dlrs.
    Giordano said the exchange had been impressed with the
performance of its Australian dollar contract, which since its
introduction last year had regularly topped the French franc as
the third most popular traded option, with up to 8,000
contracts traded daily.
    Having the Philadelphia exchange open during the
Asia-Pacific market day would open new hedging opportunities,
set a truer level for over-the-counter option trading, increase
arbitraging opportunities and give corporations and treasuries
access to a currency option market of much greater depth and
liquidity with the security of a clearing house, he said.

because the dollar had fallen too far, Sumita said he still
thought the pact was a good one in the sense that it had
corrected the overvaluation of the dollar. But the Plaza accord
did not set any target for the dollar's fall, he said.

    Analysts have speculated that GenCorp, on a break-up basis,
could fetch more than 110 to 120 dlrs per share.
    GenCorp officials had no comment on General Acquisition's
statement but a spokesman reiterated an earlier request to
shareholders to wait until its board renders an opinion before
making a decision on the General Acquisition tender.
    Gencorp said its statement would be made on or before the

    General Acquisition made its statement in a letter sent to

    The partnership said it was willing to negotiate all points

duties to GenCorp shareholders and make a fully informed
decision about its offer until it has "thoroughly explored with
us the ways in which our offer can be revised to provide
greater value to your shareholders."
    General Acquisition said it is aware the board may be
reviewing alternative transactions which might provide GenCorp
shareholders with a payment other than cash.
    "If that is the case, you should recognize that our
additional equity capital may very well enable us to offer cash
and securities having greater value than GenCorp could provide
in any similarly structured transaction," the partnership said.
    General Acquisition also said it believes that GenCorp's
board has an obligation to present any alternative transaction
it may propose to shareholders in a manner that would allow for
competing offers.
    The partnership requested that if any other proposal is
under consideration that it be given the same information
available to GenCorp's managers and advisers in constructing a
proposal.
     General Acquisition said that if GenCorp agrees to accept
another buyout proposal that it also be given an opportunity to
bid on a competitive and fair basis before any final decision
is made.
    General Acquisition repeated its request that GenCorp
remove its "poison pill" or shareholders rights plan.
    General Acquisition said if GenCorp does not allow an
"environment for fair competition," it will take all steps
necessary to create such an enviroment.

shareholders in calling a special meeting to replace the board
and to consider other proposals it might develop.

The government is determined to ride out
the latest sharp rise of the yen without taking panic measures
because it expects the currency's appreciation to prove
temporary, senior officials said.
    "The market has already located a ceiling (for the yen) and
market forces are pushing the dollar back up a bit," one senior
Finance Ministry official said.
    He attributed the dollar's fall in recent days to special
factors, in particular, selling by Japanese investors ahead of
the March 31 end to their fiscal year.
    That selling largely came to an end this morning after
about one hour of trading here, the senior official said. "They
(the investors) became more or less quiet after 10 o'clock
(0100 GMT)," he said.
    After falling to a record low of 144.70 yen this morning,
the dollar edged back up in late trading to end at 146.20.
Dealers attributed the late rise to remarks by Prime Minister
Yasuhiro Nakasone that major nations had agreed to stabilise
the dollar above 150 yen.
    Several officials said they did not see any fundamental
reason for the dollar's recent sharp fall.
    One official even called the market's recent actions
irrational. If anything, the U.S. Decision to slap tariffs on
Japanese electronics goods should support the dollar against
the yen because it will cut Japanese exports to the U.S., He
said.
    As a result, several officials said they saw no reason to
alter the broad thrust of government policy agreed to at last
month's meeting of major nations in Paris.
    "We don't see any substantial reason to change our policy
stance," one senior official said.

its first-quarter results to reach "all-time highs."

said the previous high for a single quarter was 27,179,000 dlrs
for the 1986 fourth quarter.
    Walbro estimated income for the quarter will exceed
first-quarter 1986 income, which was 1,953,000 dlrs, or 66 cts

especially automotive electronic fuel injection components and
carburetors for lawn and garden applications.
    However, it said it is unlikely the company will sustain
the same record pace of sales and income throughout 1987, due
to an expected reduction in throttle body sales.
    "It now appears likely that the company's throttle body
business with General Motors Corp <GM> will peak in the first

Canada's gross domestic product rose 0.1
pct, seasonally adjusted, in January after gaining 1.0 pct in
December but falling 0.1 pct and 0.3 pct in November and
October, Statistics Canada said.
    January's rise, in 1981 prices, was fueled largely by a 0.5
pct gain in the goods producing sector. Output in
services-producing industries declined 0.1 pct from December's
level.
    January's level was 1.29 pct higher than the same month a
year ago.
    The federal agency said it was the second straight gain for
goods producing industries. Most of the growth occurred in
manufacturing and construction.
    Within manufacturing, strong gains were posted in the wood,
machinery, non-metallic mineral and food product groups.
Significant declines were recorded in the output of automobiles
and parts, however.
    In the services sector, increases in finance, insurance and

International Business Machines Corp
<IBM> is widely expected to deeply affect the personal computer
industry this week when it announces a long awaited new
generation of desktop machines.
     The four new computers, expected to be called the Personal
System 2 family, are almost sure to veer away from industrywide
standards for personal computers that were first established by
IBM six years ago.
     The result id the new computers will be harder to copy and
less likely to work with software and attachments designed for
existing standards. Some market researchers are already
predicting slower growth as customers adjust to the change.
    A proprietary IBM pc will cause the pc market's growth to
be flat or even negative in 1988 as vendors and users delay
purchases to gauge the importance of the new machine,'' said
John McCarthy, consultant with Forrester Research Inc.
     IBM is traditionally very close-mouthed about unannounced
products, but so intense is the interest in these machines that
some details have leaked out and consultants, dealers and the
trade press are rife with information, both factual or
supposed.
    The four computers expected to be announced April 2 will
reportedly include one low end, low cost computer, two models
that will resemble IBM's current high-end AT, and, most
importantly, a computer incorporating Intel Corp's <INTC> 80386
microprocessor, the powerhouse chip that is revolutionizing the
personal computer.
    The microprocessor is the brains of a computer and Intel
microprocessors are the ones used in all IBM and IBM-compatible
personal computers, by far the largest segment of the desktop
market.
     The 80386, more commonly called the 386, processes
computer instructions twice as fast as the chips used in
existing IBM computers and 386-based desktop computers are as
powerful as the much larger minicomputers of a few years ago.
     Although IBM will not be the first company to introduce a
386 personal computer - Compaq Corp <CPQ> was - most industry
consultants believe that customers will not rush to embrace the
new generation until they see what the world's largest computer
company is going to do.
    What IBM will apparently do is introduce a computer that
is, at least temporarily, copy-proof. That is a far different
situation than exists with IBM's current family of personal
computers, which are cloned widely.
     With the Personal System, IBM will reportedly build as
many features as possible directly into the computers'
motherboards, including graphics capabilities, a non-standard
bus for add-on equipment and a new version of the operating
system used on all IBM compatible computers.
     The word in (Silicon) Valley is that it will take two mln
dlrs and 18 months before the machines can be copied,'' said
Michael Murphy, publisher of the newsletter California
Technology Stock Letter.
      At the same time as Personal System is unveiled,
Microsoft Corp <MSFT> is expected to unveil a new version of
its MS/DOS operating system, DOS 3.3, that will correct many of
the programming problems encountered on earlier versions of the
software. MS/DOS is used with all IBM personal computers.
      Consultants said that most existing IBM-compatible
software will run on the new computers but software written
specifically for the Personal System will not run on older
models.
     The industry will be looking closely at the delivery dates
for the new computers, particularly the 386, because if IBM
does not start shipping its entry in this important new market
soon, Compaq will continue to gain larger and larger market
share.
    Market researcher Future Computing Inc estimated that
Compaq's Deskpro 386, which started shipping last October, is
generating sales of between 3.5 mln and and four mln dlrs a
month. In the first six months of availability between 21 and
24 mln dlrs worth of Deskpro 386s were sold.
    Said Future Computing analyst Joe Cross, "That's some
indication of the kind of money IBM is leaving on the table."

The International Primary Market Makers
Association, a trade organisation, said its board last week
adopted new rules recommending lead managers of eurodollar bond
issues make a market in that security for 12 months.
    Currently, while there is an implied obligation on the part
of firms to make markets in issues they underwrite, there is no
formal obligation to do so.
    Christopher Sibson, secretary general of IPMA, in
explaining why the recommendation was adopted, said "It is aimed
at the problem of the lead manager who does a deal and
disappears."
    Sibson said the organization cannot force its members to
adhere to the rule. "We're under no illusions about the legal
binding force of these recommendations," he said.
    Lead managers have occasionally abandoned efforts to
support an unprofitable issue just a short while after it has
been offered, leaving investors and smaller firms with no one
to buy it back from them.
    Most recently, when prices of perpetual floating rates
notes (FRNs) suddenly plunged, most market makers abandoned the
securities altogether, leaving investors stuck with about 17
billion dlrs worth of unmarketable securities on their books.
     Sibson noted that the recommendation adopted by the board
only applies  to fixed-rate dollar issues and would not have
helped the floating rate sector out of its current crisis.
    Among other measures, the IPMA also decided that the
criteria for membership should be tightened to exclude some of
the smaller firms.
    Under the new rules, a firm must be the book running lead
manager during the two preceding years of 12 internationally
distributed debt issues denominated in U.S. Dlrs or in one of
eight other major currencies.
    The former requirement called for three lead-managed
issues. Sibson said he expects the tighter entrance
requirements to pare 3he current list of 67 members down by six
to 10 members.
    Smaller firms have criticized IPMA's efforts to restrict
membership to the larger firms, saying it is anti-competitive
and that it reinforces the big firms' already large market
share.
    "Belonging to IPMA carries a certain amount of prestige with
borrowers," said a dealer at a small foreign bank. "The borrower
says to himself, "Well I can travel economy or I can travel
first class,'" he said.
    Sibson defended the new rules saying "We have to steer a
course between representing the interests of the major market
makers and the less desirable goal of representing everybody."
    In any event, he said, the size of the market has expanded
to the point where the former minimum size requirements were
just too small.
    Also, IPMA members will be required to register with the
Association of International Bond Dealers as reporting dealers,
submitting daily information on prices on issues in which they
are market makers. The effective date of the rule has yet to be
determined.
    Dealers said that the rule would enable investors and
secondary market makers to better evaluate the appropriate
market price for their securities. Such a rule would make
investors more confident of trading in the eurobond market and
would increase liquidity, they said.
    Dealers said that the form of the reporting has not yet
been spelled out. But previous discussion of the reporting
requirement considered firms listing the closing price of a
given security as well as the high and low for the day.
     Members also agreed at the IPMA meeting on the
implementation of a new communications system which enables a
lead manager to invite all potential management group members
in to a deal at the same time.

The Financial Times/Stock Exchange index
of Britain's 100 leading shares fell by its largest ever margin
in points terms during a single session, dropping 46.1 to close
at 2,002.5. The index earlier today touched a low of 1,993.7.
    Before today the largest one day points decline was a 35.8

    The index fall was triggered by fears a trade war could
break out with Japan following news the U.S. Increased tariffs
on Japanese imports after the breakdown of a 1986 semiconductor

The U.K. Government bond market closed
showing severe losses ranging to almost 1-1/2 points as sharp
falls for U.S Treasury bonds resulting from pronounced dollar
weakness exacerbated existing uncertainty, dealers said.
    Selling was described as relatively modest, although very
few buyers appeared to take up the slack. Much of the momentum
was derived from the futures market, where a high 33,074 lots
were traded in the long gilt June contract.
    The Treasury 13-1/2 pct stock due 2004/08 closed 1-7/16
point lower at 135-20/32 stg pct while the Treasury 10 pct due
1991 ended at 105-12/32 for a fall of 1-3/16.
    Dealers noted that market confidence had already been at a
low ebb, with much of the recent impressive rise whittled away
last week as investors reacted nervously to opinion polls
showing unexpectedly strong gains for the centrist
Liberal/Social Democratic alliance.
    The market had been sustained in large part during its
recent rally by a virtual conviction that the ruling
Conservative party would first call and then win a general
election early this summer.
    However, advances credited to the alliance last week have
cast doubt on both assumptions.
    "Turnover in the cash market has actually been quite small,"
one dealer said, adding that price movements had been very
volatile at times.
    After losing ground heavily in the Far East in tandem with
the flagging dollar, U.S. Bonds fell further in London trading
but showed some signs of recovery late in the U.S. Morning as
the dollar steadied a little against the yen. The latest period
of weakness for the dollar has accentuated fears that currency
risk might induce Japanese investors in particular to undertake
dramatic reductions in their portfolios of U.S. Treasury
issues.
    Dealers noted that early strength in the index-linked
sector of the market, which had enabled the Government broker
to supply some of both index-linked stock tranches announced on
Friday, had soon fallen prey to the general depression
affecting gilts.
    The Treasury 2-1/2 pct index-linked stock due 2020 closed
just under one point lower at 100-11/32 stg pct.

it would not distribute the CASI system, but would develop its

The U.S. Senate has approved a
measure that would allow an estimated 4,200 agricultural banks
to write off loan losses over 10 years.
    The measure, offered by Sen. Alan Dixon (D-Ill.), was
attached to a bill to recapitalize the Federal Savings and Loan
Insurance Corp that the Senate approved March 27.
    Dixon's amendment would permit agricultural banks -- banks
with assets of 100 mln dlrs or less and at least 25 pct of
total loans in farm loans -- to write down over 10 years
agricultural loan losses incurred between 1984 and 1992.
    Dixon said current law, which requires losses to be
deducted immediately from bank capital, "forces banks to try not
to acknowledge the extent of their problems."
    Sen. Nancy Kassebaum (R-Kan.) said farm banks have been
concerned that write-downs might reduce their capitalization
below the six pct regulatory requirement.
    Last year Congress urged federal regulators to use
forbearance in the assessment of agricultural loans. However,
Kassebaum said "only a miniscule number of banks" have qualified
for the capital forbearance provisions.
    Dixon's measure also would allow agricultural banks to
amortize losses on the reduced value of farmland acquired in
the handling of agricultural loans.

Prime Minister Jacques Chirac said the
budget deficit next year will be reduced by about 15 billion
francs, and the government's planned programme of 50 billion
francs' tax cuts for 1987/88 will be implemented, a statement
from the Prime Minister's office said.
    The forecasts were contained in a letter of guidance to
ministries to prepare for the 1988 budget to be voted by
Parliament in autumn.
    Finance Minister Edouard Balladur plans to cut the 1988
budget deficit to around 115 billion francs from the forecast
1987 deficit of 129 billion, and to 100 billion francs in 1989.
    Chirac's statement said that to achieve the twin aims of
reducing the deficit and granting tax relief "a vigourous effort
to contain spending will have to be made."
    As in his letter to ministries last year, Chirac repeated
the aim to reduce by 1.5 pct the number of civil servants

General Motors Corp has cut 100,000
cars from its second quarter production schedule, according to
Automotive News.
    The trade paper, citing "sources both within GM and on the
outside," said GM plans to build 1,042,708 cars in the quarter,
a nine pct reduction from its earlier estimate. The cut could
lead to further layoffs at GM, it said.
    A GM spokesman said the company does not disclose future 
production schedules.
    Auto analysts said the cut would make sense for GM, which
has high car inventories.
    A 100,000-car reduction in output would only take GM part
of the way toward reducing high inventories, said Ron Glantz,
analyst with Montgomery Securities.
    "They should be cutting a lot more than they are," Shearson
Lehman analyst Michael Lucky said. He estimated that, even if
GM cut an additional 100,000 cars from its second quarter
production, it would still have a 75-day supply of cars.
    Normal inventory level is 50 to 65 days supply. At the end
of March, the automaker had 95 days supply, Lucky said.
    Glantz said that at the end of February GM had 361,000
excess vehicles, including both cars and trucks.
    The production cuts could lead to increased layoffs,
although those would likely be temporary rather than indefinite
layoffs, said Lucky.
    He said the automaker might also use this as an opportunity
to close some plants. Lucky estimates that GM needs to shut two
or three more assembly plants to bring its capacity more in
line with demand.

Floating-rate notes denominated in a
foreign currency, a relatively new wrinkle on Wall Street, will
probably be issued infrequently because the so-called "window
of opportunity" opens and closes quickly, traders say.
    "In just two days we had as many issues. As a result, the
market became glutted," said one trader.
    He said the window depends more on supply than on foreign
exchange or interest rate risk, at least for the moment.
"Obviously, currency risk is important. But there is a limited
number of investors right now for the paper," he said.
    On Thursday, Bear, Stearns and Co sole-managed a 100 mln
New Zealand dlr offering of three-year floating-rate notes
issued by Ford Motor Credit Co, a unit of Ford Motor Co <F>.
    The initial rate for the notes will be set on April 15, and
quarterly after that, at 200 basis points below the 90-day New
Zealand bank bill rate. They are non-callable for life.
    This followed by a week another Bear Stearns-led offering
of the same amount of New Zealand dollar notes for Dow Chemical
Co <DOW>. The initial rate was also to be initially set on
April 15, and quarterly after that, at 340 basis points below
the same 90-day New Zealand rate.
    Because the Dow Chemical notes carried an interest rate
floor of 17 pct, the issue saw strong investor demand,
underwriters said.
    But the Ford Credit notes and Friday's offering of 130 mln
New Zealand dlrs of floating-rate notes due 1990 issued by
General Electric Co's <GE> General Electric Credit Corp via
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc, did not have such a floor.
    "Obviously, the two firms did not want to issue floaters
and face the risk of New Zealand rates falling sharply," an
underwriter away from the syndicates said. He and others noted
that the New Zealand 90-day rate was 27 pct late last week.
    An underwriter familiar with the Dow Chemical deal pointed
out that because of the interest rate and currency swaps Dow
did, the issuer felt comfortable setting a rate floor.
    Domestic offerings of foreign currency denominated date
first surfaced in Fall 1985. By using currency and rate swaps,
companies can sell debt that pays a high interest rate in a
foreign currency like Australian or New Zealand dollars. But
the issuers actually realize savings on borrowing costs.
    "I would say that every company which issued foreign
currency debt saved some basis points when compared to
same-maturity plain vanilla U.S. issues," an analyst said.
    Investors, mainly institutions, were attracted to the early
issues because of the high interest rates. They were willing to
absorb foreign currency risk until mid-1986, when sharp slides
posted by the Australian and New Zealand dollars brought such
issuance to a quick halt.
    It was not until late last year, after the currencies
stabilized, that companies again started issuing debt
denominated in Australian and New Zealand dollars.
    But many investors have still shied away from the debt,
remembering the mid-1986 downturn of the Australian and New
Zealand dollars, analysts noted.
    To attract some of those investors back to the fold,
underwriters like Bear Stearns decided to structure the foreign
currency issues as floating rate debt, sources said.
    This occurred against a backdrop of uncertainty over the
course of U.S. interest rates for the intermediate term, and
predictions by a number of economists that Treasury yields
would rise in the second half of the year, the sources noted.
    A Bear Stearns officer said more than half of the Ford
Credit notes were sold by late Friday afternoon, the second day
of offering. "That is quicker than some recent fixed-rate New
Zealand dollar note issues," he said.
    However, underwriters away from the Bear Stearns syndicate
said the issue may have sold even faster if Prudential-Bache
did not offer the General Electric Credit notes on Friday.
    They pointed out that the Ford notes were rated A-1 by
Moody's Investors and AA-minus by Standard and Poor's, while
the General Electric notes, which had the same interest rate
terms and were also non-callable to maturity, carried
top-flight AAA ratings by both agencies.
    "We have sold 20 to 25 pct of the GE notes. For first-day
sales on a Friday afternoon, I'm happy with the results," an
officer on Prudential-Bache's syndicate desk said.
    Investors pay the U.S. dollar equivalent of the foreign
currency-denominated notes, underwriters said.
    Investment bankers said the next floating-rate issue of New
Zealand or Australian dollar-denominated debt is probably a few
weeks away.
    "I would like to underwrite a deal a day. But with the Dow,
Ford and GE offerings, the marketplace has had enough for the
time being," the Prudential-Bache officer admitted.
    Meanwhile, IDD Information Services said the 30-day
corporate visible supply fell to 3.29 billion dlrs last week
from 3.98 billion dlrs in the previous week.

Texaco Inc said it has filed
a motion with the Texas Court of Appeals in Houston seeking a
rehearing of the court's decision to uphold most of Pennzoil
Co's 11.12 billion dlr judgment against Texaco.
    The company said its motion cites over 200 errors contained
in the February 12 appeals court decision, adding its "brief
simply 'rubberstamps' the original trial court judgment which
the company has said 'riddled with errors'."
    In support of its argument, Texaco's motion emphasized a
recent case before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh
Circuit in Chicago in Skycom Corp v. Telstar Corp as
"unequivocal confirmation that the Texas Court's opinion is
wrong," according to Gibson Gayle, a Texaco attorney with the
Houston firm of Fulbright and Jaworski.
    "The United States Court of Appeals in Chicago issued the
ruling based on facts strikingly similar to the facts in the
Texaco-Pennzoil litigation," he said.
    "The question before the (federal appeals) court was
whether an "agreement in principle' subject to execution of
'formal documents' is a contract according to New York law.
    "The answer by the court was a resounding 'No' -- precisely
opposite the answer given by the Appellate Court in Texas,"
Gayle said.
    "The United States Court of appeals reached this decision
for the identical reasons that Texas and the Attorney General
of New York have cited in their briefs before the Texas
appellate court," he pointed out.
    "Texaco has consistently maintained that Pennzoil did not
have a binding contract to Buy Getty Oil shares, since a press
release announced only an 'agreement in principle' which was
'subject to the execution of a definitive merger agreement',"
according to Gayle.

Investors who have been riding the
bull market in U.S. stocks got a stinging reminder today of how
unexpected news can trigger sharp reversals.
    "The market was ripe for some type of pullback," said Frank
Korth, analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers. He said over the
weekend, investors pondered President Reagan's decision to
impose tariffs on Japanese electronic goods and some concluded
the step could signal the beginning of a trade war.
    The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 79 points in 30
minutes before stabilizing and making a partial recovery.
    Korth believes there has been an over-reaction and
near-term traders might want to step in and buy one-half or
one-quarter of new investments they have been considering.
    "We're still in a bull market," said William Raftery of
Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co. He thinks history has shown
such sharp pullbacks are a natural part of bull markets. "The
bear usually strikes slowly," he said.
    Raftery noted that blue chips have been forefront of the
rally that took the market to record highs last week. In
today's decline, he said, the big name stocks were coming more
into a more normal alignment with the general market.
    Charles Comer of Moseley Securities Corp said ultimately
the pullback could prove to be a pre-shock to the long awaited
correction. But for now he believes the bull market remains
intact. However, it could take several weeks for the market to
complete a "distribution process" and along the way there will
be rallies.
    Comer thinks it is premature to conclude that today's
action signaled formation of a market top. He thinks the market
can hold in the low to mid 2200 area on the Dow index.
    "This probably is the correction that has been expected,"
said Crandall Hays of Robert W. Baird Co.
    Hays noted that market breadth began to deteriorate last
week. He said this morning investors saw the dollar down
further, interest rates up and gold up. "The trade problem got
people spooked and and all the bad things were happening at
once," he said.
    "This correction could take us down 150 points and we're
half-way there now," he said early today.
    He thinks the downward move in stock prices could be over
in a couple of weeks. Business conditions seem to be getting
better according to what he hears from a broad cross-section of
companies, from retailers to machinery manufacturers.
    "The market was high and people were looking for a
correction, so this was an excuse for the market to go down,"
said Alan Ackerman of Gruntal and Co.
    He believes investors will be in a mood of extreme caution
or slightly negative for the near term.
    Ackerman thinks the U.S. is attempting to "fire a shot
across Japan's bow and let them know we're serious about having
closer trade ties." But nevertheless investors have been
rattled by "a perception that a full scale trade war is
possible." Ultimately, unless there is an accord, the effects
could be higher interest rates and unemployment, he said.
    "I anticipate a further correction later this week," said
Harry Laubscher of Tucker Anthony, R.L. Day. He thinks the
pullback was "the start of an overdue correction of between six
and 10 pct from the market highs."
    Although investors now have new reason to worry about
higher interests rate and a return of inflation, Laubscher
says, "it is not the end of the bull market."
    "The market was looking for a reason to knock itself down a
little bit, and with the trade sanctions coming largely as a
surprise, this was the think the market attached itself to,"
said Gary Ciminero of Fleet Financial Group.

U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
Lawson said the meeting of six major industrial nations in
Paris last month agreed not to publish any bands in connection
with their pact to stabilise currencies.
    Questioned by a parliamentary select committee about why
the participating countries had not announced any bands, Lawson
replied, "we all agreed it would be much more sensible not to."
When asked whether that meant an informal joint currency float
with set ranges was arranged in Paris, Lawson said "I do not
want to reveal the precise nature of the agreement, so as not
to make it easy for" speculation against the accord.
    Lawson said the Paris accord presumed that individual
countries would take corrective action if their currency began
reacting significantly to domestic macroeconomic factors.
    But if such movements were due to extraneous factors,
Lawson said the other pact countries would come to its aid
through concerted intervention on the foreign exchanges.
    "It is clear that both Germany and Japan are having
difficulty adjusting to their very large exchange rate
appreciations and making their economies more domestically
oriented, just as it is taking time for the United States to
make its own economy more export oriented," Lawson said.
    In his oral evidence to Parliament's Select Treasury
Committee, Lawson repeated that he was happy with the pound's
current level, adding that "It is an objective ... To try to
keep it around that level."
    He said the perception of sterling on foreign exchanges had
changed since the steep drop in oil prices, largely because the
pound had weathered that period so successfully. "There has been
a reassessment of sterling's fundamentals," Lawson said.  He
disagreed with what he termed "the grossly exaggerated claim"
that real U.K. Interest rates were much higher than those of
other major industrialsed countries.
    Using as a reference the key three-month sterling interbank
rate as quoted in London, Lawson said Britain now had a real
interest rate level of 5.75 pct - the same as Japan did and
only a 0.75 percentaage point above the Group of Five average.
    Lawson confirmed that "over the medium and longer term, the
government's objective is zero inflation."
    He said the government's intention of its PSBR constant at
1.0 pct of GDP "is the modern equivalent of the balanced budget
doctrine."  He added that "to allow the debt/GDP ratio to remain
constant on anything other than zero inflation basis is simply
a recipe for accelerating inflation."

U.S. Senate Budget Committee
Chairman Lawton Chiles' (D-Fla.) fiscal 1988 budget plan would
cut farm spending by about two billion dlrs, primarily by
making unspecified changes in price and income support
programs, Senate staff members said.
    Chiles presented his budget blueprint late last week and
said he would like to begin voting on it this week.
    Senate Republican staff members said Chiles was
recommending that policy changes be adopted for 1988 crops.
    While savings from the changes would accrue mainly in
fiscal 1989, Chiles said his income and price support proposals
would trim about two billion dlrs from advance deficiency
payments, most of which would be made in the spring of next
year.
    It was not clear how the Senate Budget panel head would
achieve the savings in Commodity Credit Corp outlays. Aides to
Chiles would not comment on how the CCC savings would be made.
    Recently the Congressional Budget Office released a report
listing possible price and income support program savings.
    The options included lowering target prices, increasing
unpaid acreage reduction programs, targeting income support
payments to specific groups of producers, limiting the use of
generic commodity certificates, raising loan rates and
"decoupling" income support payments from production decisions.
    Chiles proposed saving about 100 mln dlrs by freezing the
U.S. Agriculture Department's discretionary spending functions
which include research and credit programs, Senate staff said.
    The Florida senator's plan also would provide 30 mln dlrs
for organic farming research and 20 mln dlrs for homeless aid.

A group led by members of the

    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
the group said it has had discussions with other Taft

"concerning participation in a group to acquire control" of the

    The Bass group, which did not identify any of the other

discussions relating to the future control and direction" of
the company.

its members may buy more shares of Taft common stock, or may
decide to sell some or all of its stake.

The International Primary Market Makers
Association, a trade organisation, said its board last week
adopted new rules recommending lead managers of eurodollar bond
issues make a market in that security for 12 months.
    Currently, while there is an implied obligation on the part
of firms to make markets in issues they underwrite, there is no
formal obligation to do so.
    Christopher Sibson, secretary general of IPMA, in
explaining why the recommendation was adopted, said "It is aimed
at the problem of the lead manager who does a deal and
disappears."
    Sibson said the organization cannot force its members to
adhere to the rule. "We're under no illusions about the legal
binding force of these recommendations," he said.
    Lead managers have occasionally abandoned efforts to
support an unprofitable issue just a short while after it has
been offered, leaving investors and smaller firms with no one
to buy it back from them.
    Most recently, when prices of perpetual floating rates
notes (FRNs) suddenly plunged, most market makers abandoned the
securities altogether, leaving investors stuck with about 17
billion dlrs worth of unmarketable securities on their books.
     Sibson noted that the recommendation adopted by the board
only applies  to fixed-rate dollar issues and would not have
helped the floating rate sector out of its current crisis.
    Among other measures, the IPMA also decided that the
criteria for membership should be tightened to exclude some of
the smaller firms.
    Under the new rules, a firm must be the book running lead
manager during the two preceding years of 12 internationally
distributed debt issues denominated in U.S. Dlrs or in one of
eight other major currencies.
    The former requirement called for three lead-managed
issues. Sibson said he expects the tighter entrance
requirements to pare 3he current list of 67 members down by six
to 10 members.
    Smaller firms have criticized IPMA's efforts to restrict
membership to the larger firms, saying it is anti-competitive
and that it reinforces the big firms' already large market
share.
    "Belonging to IPMA carries a certain amount of prestige with
borrowers," said a dealer at a small foreign bank. "The borrower
says to himself, "Well I can travel economy or I can travel
first class,'" he said.

TransAmerican Natural Gas Corp, which
has been operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection since
January 1983, said it filed an amended and restated negotiated
plan of reorganization.
    A hearing on the adequacy of the disclosure statement is
scheduled for April 29 in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the
Southern District of Texas.
    Basic terms of the amended and restated negotiated plan
have not changed from the original plan filed last October, the
company said.
     The amended filing reflects adding ancillary documents to
the plan filed in October, it said.
    Assuming the plan is found adequate on April 29,
TransAmerican would then seek acceptance from creditors which
is relatively assured since they participated in the
negotiations, the company said.
    Liabilities in excess of one billion dlrs are being
reorganized under the amended plan which provides for full
debt-repayment to secured bank lenders.
    Unsecured creditors would receive either 100 pct repayment,
secured by liens on assets, or one-time lump sum payments of 25
to 35 cts on the dollar, in cash, shortly after confirmation of
the plan by the court.
    TransAmerican is vigorously resisting efforts by Coastal
Corp <CGP> to acquire its assets through a subsequent plan of
liquidation.
    The spokesman said the company is confident its plan will
be confirmed and is optimistic that it will emerge from Chapter
11 as early ninety days after the April 29 confirmation.
    A Coastal spokesman said it will file a plan in April with
the court and will request the court to review its plan.
    On March 17, the company said that as a creditor, which is
owed 625,000 dlrs, it has a right to file its own plan which
will better serve the other creditors in a shorter time.
    A TransAmerican spokesman said the net worth of Coastal's
offer is less than 25 pct of the fair market value of
Transamerican's assets which are in excess of one billion dlrs.

subordinated debt following its purchase of Rexnord Inc. 
    Rexnord's 50 mln dlrs of 12-3/4 pct debentures of 1994 were
cut to B from A-minus to reflect the merger with Banner.
    While increasing Banner's size and diversity, S and P said
the transaction heightens financial risk, with debt to capital

    Near-term earnings and cash flow protection will weaken
from the acquisition, though Banner's plans to sell some

Texas' cotton crop stands little
chance of damage from frigid temperatures expected tonight in

    "It's still pretty early for cotton planting. Only six pct
of the crop was planted as of last week," said Doug Stillmann,

    Stillmann and other cotton market sources said planting had
begun in the Rio Grande Valley and South Texas areas only, with
planting in the crucial high and low plains areas not slated to
begin until next month. The high and low plains accounted for
60 pct of the 2.5 mln bales produced in Texas last year,

The Bass Group, once thought by
analysts to be eager to sell its holdings in Taft Broadcasting
Co, emerged as another potential bidder for the Ohio
broadcasting company.
    The Bass Group, which holds 24.9 pct of Taft, said it had
talked with other taft stockholders and some company managers
and directors "concerning participation in a group to acquire
control" of the company.
    The Bass group said it had talks with other Taft
stockholders and members of Taft management about participating
in a group to acquire control. The group, which is led by the
wealthy bass brothers of Fort Worth, Texas, did not identify
any of the other people with whom it had talks.
    Taft said Friday it would negotiate with its vice Chairman
Dudley Taft on his group's 150 dlr per share or 1.38 billion
dlr offer for the company.
    At the time, the company said it authorized its adviser,
Goldman, Sachs and Co, to explore other takeover proposals and
to supply financial data to other interested bidders.
    "If indeed, the reason Dudley Taft is no longer president
is because the bass group tossed him out, I couldn't see them
backing him on any deal," said one analyst, who asked not to be
identified.
    "I think they wanted a way out. Now, this sounds like
they're going to join the group and buy themselves out," said
Edward Atorino, media analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham
and Co.
    Analysts have speculated that Carl Lindner may be
interested in acquiring the company. they speculated he may be
one of the shareholders in talks with the bass group.
    Lindner, chairman of American Financial Corp, holds 16.2
pct of Taft. He was not immediately available for comment.
    Analysts have said they are baffled by the strength of
Taft's stock price compared to what they see as breakup values
for the company.
    Several analysts had estimated a break up value of less
than 150. One analyst said he believes it has a breakup value
of 160 to 165 dlrs per share.
    Taft stock closed at 156-1/2, up 1-3/4.

Sharp cutbacks in drilling in Oklahoma
and Kansas pushed the U.S. drilling rig count down by 36 to a
total of 748, against 1,034 working rigs one year ago, Hughes
Tool Co said.
    The latest weekly count of rig activity reversed last
week's gain of 23 rigs for a total of 784, which had been the
first improvement in the drilling rig count this year.
    "I have no explanation for the decline," said Hughes
economist Ike Kerridge. "I think we're near the bottom of this
year's rig count but the wet ground in northern and
midcontinent states could affect the count in the next few
weeks."
    Among individual states, Oklahoma and Kansas reported
declines of 16 and 11 working rigs last week. Texas lost seven
and Michigan and Wyoming were each down by three rigs. Gains
were reported in Louisiana and California, which increased by
seven and six, respectively.
    In Canada, the rig count dropped by 52 to a total of 131
working rigs, against 222 one year ago. Kerridge attributed the
steep drop to the government's annual springtime ban against
rigs and other heavy equipment being transported over
rain-softened highways.

Senators are considering offering a
host of amendments to a farm disaster assistance bill which
could come up soon on the Senate floor, staff members said.
    The bill, already passed by the House, would enable 1987
winter wheat and feedgrains farmers hit by Midwestern flooding
last year to receive at least 92 pct of their federal income
support payments even if they did not plant.
    Amendments considered by Sen. Rudy Boschwitz (R-Minn.)
would apply the so-called "0/92" option to all 1987 program crops
or, if that failed, to spring wheat, Senate staff said.
    Sens. Robert Dole (R-Kan.) and Charles Grassley (R-Iowa)
were considering an amendment that would allow feedgrains
producers to receive final deficiency payments in March instead
of in October.
    Earlier this year Dole said advancing the final deficiency
payments would provide feedgrains producers with approximately
three billion dlrs in income payments prior to spring planting
instead of in the fall.
    Dole and Grassley are also considering an amendment that
would offer a two dlr per bushel bonus payment to corn farmers
for any erodible cropland they enrolled in the conservation
reserve program last year.
    The bonus payment has been offered to farmers signing up
for the corn program this spring. The U.S. Agriculture
Department has indicated it would oppose broadening the corn
bonus offer.
    Sen. Larry Pressler (R-S.D.) was said to be contemplating
an amendment that would offer the 0/92 option to spring wheat
producers who were prevented from planting this spring because
of flooding last year.
    Sen. David Boren (D-Okla.) was eyeing a measure that would
allow cotton producers to receive disaster aid if the quality
of their crop was hurt by flooding last year.
    Democrats and Republicans today were still trying to arrive

The Federal Reserve's move to easier
monetary policy, begun with four quick half-point discount rate
cuts in 1986, will likely end with a final rate drop in the
second quarter, analysts said.
    A poll of 10 economists shows most expect interest rates to
edge lower, with the Fed likely to drop its basic lending rate
from 5-1/2 pct late next quarter to help the economy.
    "The Fed is not likely to ease policy much further without
a full-blown recession," said Raymond Stone, chief financial
economist at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
    Stone said economic data available by late June may be just
weak enough to prompt one more discount rate cut. But he said
it may only be a quarter-point drop instead of the usual half
point, to avoid hurting the dollar further.
    All of the economists agreed that the Federal Open Market
Committee tomorrow will leave Fed policy unchanged.
    The average forecast of those surveyed projects roughly
quarter-point drops by the end of June in both the Treasury
bond yield, to 7-1/2 pct, and the Federal funds rate at which
banks lend to one another, to 5-7/8 pct. Most expect the prime
lending rate at major banks to remain at 7-1/2 pct.
    Other broad predictions of the survey, relating mainly to
the April-June quarter, follow:
    - The dollar is likely to decline five to 10 pct further
against other major currencies because of a large U.S. budget
deficit and a wide, but narrowing, trade gap. Contacted after
the dollar's steep drop in the last two business days, the
economists reaffirmed this view but stressed the risk is that
the dollar will fall more, rather than less, than they expect.
    - Oil prices in the second quarter are likely to continue
trading roughly between 16 and 19 dlrs a barrel and could well
test the lower end of that range.
    - Stocks will continue to outperform bonds next quarter and
probably for all of 1987. Stocks should gain on strong
foreign demand and a modest second-half economic rise. The
outlook for bonds also is less favorable later in the year
since both inflation and interest rates may be edging up.
    - Inflation as measured by the GNP implicit price deflator
will rise to around 3.3 pct this year from 2.7 pct in 1986. The
sharp fall in the dollar to date will add to inflation, as will
a mild economic pickup in the second half of this year.
    - U.S. real gross national product, which grew at a two pct
annual rate in the 1986 second half, should expand at
respective rates of about 2.3 pct and 2.5 pct in the 1987 first
and second halves. First-quarter growth is put at a 2.4 pct
annual
rate, slowing to 2.1 pct next quarter.
    Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International sees
both the strongest economy and the highest interest rates among
those surveyed. He expects real GNP, which grew at a 1.1 pct
rate in fourth-quarter 1986, to expand at a 3.3 pct rate this
quarter and 3.5 pct next quarter.
    "The economy will bounce back more strongly than many
expect," Brusca said. He said an involuntary buildup in
inventories, largely in autos, will add to first-quarter
economic growth, with consumer spending helping later.
    "We're running out of special factors to keep the economy
afloat," said Philip Braverman of Irving Securities Corp. His
interest rate and economic forecasts were among the lowest.
    Braverman said tax law changes and inventory accumulation
helped lift fourth and first quarter GNP growth, respectively.
He expects 2.5 pct first quarter growth but said that second
quarter growth could be zero or negative.
    Braverman said economic activity next quarter will suffer
from a paring of inventories, lower capital investment, slow 
government spending and less construction. Only a marginally
narrower trade deficit will add to growth.
    He sees a 7.10 pct end-of-June yield on Treasury bonds,
with Federal funds and prime rates at 5.50 and seven pct,
respectively. Nikko's Brusca projects rates of 8.25 pct for
bonds, 6.15 pct for funds and 7.75 pct for the prime rate.
    Two of the 10 economists revised rate forecasts up mildly
after the dollar's fall to 40-year lows versus the yen in past
days and news of pending U.S. trade sanctions against Japan.
    David Resler of Nomura Securities Co International Inc
raised his end-June bond yield forecast to 7.50 pct from 7.20
pct and a Fed funds rate estimate to six pct from 5.80 pct.
    Raul Nicho, president of Money Market Services Inc, lifted
his forecast of bond and Fed funds rates an eighth of a point
to eight pct for bonds and 6-1/4 pct for funds. Both Nicho and
Resler left their end-June prime rate forecast at 7-1/2 pct.
    The higher rate forecasts reflected a belief that Japanese
investors will be less eager to buy U.S. bonds because of fear
about further dollar erosion and perhaps in response to U.S.
trade sanctions. Yields may have to rise to lure other buyers.

The U.S. Department of
Transportation (DOT) said it gave final clearance to the
proposed 225 mln dlr acquisition of AirCal Inc by American
Airlines Inc.
    "The acquisition is not likely to substantially lessen
competition or to be inconsistent with the public interest," the
DOT said in a statement.
    AirCal is a unit of ACI Holdings Inc while American is a
unit of AMR Corp.
    The DOT had given tentative approval to the merger plan
Feb. 20.
    American is the third largest U.S. airline in terms of
revenue passenger miles while AirCal--a relatively small
carrier that primarily serves West Coast cities--is the
nation's 17th largest passenger carrier. Their merger would not
alter American's third-place ranking, according to data
compiled by Aviation Daily, a leading industry trade magazine.
    The combination would incrase American's share of the U.S.
market to 15.4 pct from its current 14.7 pct, the DOT said.
    The DOT said the merger was unlikely to substantially
reduce competition on the four routes on which both carriers
provide either nonstop or single-plane service.
    At 13 of the 14 terminals served by both carriers, the DOT
said it found no evidence that other carriers could not
increase or begin service that competed with a merged
American-AirCal.
    Concerning the 14th, "While entry may not be possible at the
Orange County Airport in the near future, DOT found that the
service provided at other airports in the Los Angeles area,
especially at the Los Angeles International Airport, will
provide effective competition for Orange County travelers in
long-haul markets," the DOT said.
    The merger would give American control of 37 pct of the
authorized takeoff and landing slots at the Orange County
terminal, where environmental concerns and a small terminal
building limit future opportunities for expansion.
    The DOT said the Air Line Pilots Association filed comments
opposing the merger but "raised no new facts or arguments."
    Under the merger terms, announced Nov. 17, American will
pay 15 dlrs a share for the outstanding stock of ACI Holdings.

Marvin Warner, a former U.S.

for his role in a bank failure that led to the worst banking
crisis in Ohio's history.
    He owned the Home State Savings Bank of Cincinnati at the
time of its March 9, 1985, collapse following more than 143 mln
dlrs in loses.
    Warner and two other bank officials were charged with 82
counts of misapplying the bank's funds by transferring them to
ESM Government Securities Inc., of Florida without the
authorization of the bank's board.
    ESM collapsed in March of 1985, taking Home State -- its
biggest investor -- down with it.
    Home State's failure wiped out the reserves of its insurer,
the Ohio Deposit Guarantee Fund, a state regulated institution
that was not federally insured. That prompted a run on dozens
of other savings and loan associations across the state which
were insured by the same fund, forcing some of them to close
until they obtained federal deposit insurance.
    Warner was ambassador to Switzerland during the Carter
administration.

Gencorp Inc said its board urged
shareholders to reject the hostile unsolicited 100 dlr a share
tender offer made March 18 by General Acquisition Inc, an
affiliate of Wagner and Brown and AFG Industries INc.
    Gencorp also said it is developing a financially superior
alternative that would enable shareholders to benefit from the
full value of the company.
    In a letter to shareholders, Chairman A. William Reynolds 
said the offer is a "highly conditional, contingently financed
bust-up offer" that seeks to deny shareholders the true value
of their investment in Gencorp.
    Reynolds said the board reached its decision to reject the
offer after careful study with legal and financial advisers. He
said the board has authorized management to explore
alternatives aimed at providing shareholders with a
"financially superior" alternative to the general acquisition
offer.
    A Gencorp spokesman, in response to questions, would not
comment on market speculation that the company's management may
develop a leveraged buyout offer of its own. He would also not
comment on when a better alternative might be developed.
    Gencorp's stock has traded well above the 100 dlr offer
price since the tender was made. Today, Gencorp closed at
114-1/4, up 1-5/8.
    Reynolds said in the letter that for the last few years,
Gencorp management has taken action to enhance shareholder
value, and the stock price and earnings have improved since he
joined the company.
    Gencorp said the partnership's offer is a "bargain price"
acquisition that was "using financing from a syndicate of banks
that does not yet exist and a bridge loan from Shearson Lehman
brothers that shearson is not obligated to provide."
    Reynolds also said the offer would result in a radical
alteration and selloff of Gencorp's assets, including Aerojet
General to refinance General Acquisition's borrowings with the
profits going to Wagner and Brown and AFG instead of
shareholders.
    The letter also said the General Acquisition offer
"jeopardizes the security and interests" of its shareholders,
employees, customers, suppliers and the communities throughout
the country where the company's facilities are located.

The U.S. should reassess
its Mideast policy in light of its rising dependence on
imported oil, according to Charles Ebinger of the Center for
Strategic and International Studies.
     "The prospect of rising dependence on oil imports from the
Gulf, and the recent revelations of the Tower Commission
report, mandate more than ever before the need for a
fundamental reassessment of U.S. interests in the Middle East,"
Ebinger said.
     He remarks were made in an address to the National
Petroleum Refiners Association meeting.
     "Although in the short run it is difficult to see a direct
link between Arab anger and threats to oil supplies, in the
current environment it will be increasingly difficult for
moderate Arab leaders to be seen as friendly to U.S.
interests," Ebinger said.
     Oil traders said threats to oil supplies has kept crude
oil prices strong recently although some believe prices will be
weaker if demand falls in the spring.
    But William Randol, analyst at First Boston Corp, said
crude oil prices will hold  near current levels this spring.
    There will be no spring downturn, said Randol, speaking at
the annual refiner meeting. He said there is a 40 pct chance
that crude oil prices could move higher in the second half of
the year, following an OPEC meeting scheduled for late June.
    He said he expects OPEC will extend its current agreement
to restrict production.
    OPEC will renew its production pricing agreement in June
because the value of the oil exports of the OPEC producers  has
declined along with the U.S. dollar, Randol said.
    OPEC oil exports are priced in U.S. dollars, and the dollar
has fallen about 30 pct in the last 18 months.
    Randol said U.S. crude oil imports will increase 3.5 to
four mln barrels per day by 1990 as consumption rises 1.5 to
two mln bpd, and supplies decline two mln bpd.

Japan's seasonally adjusted unemployment
rate fell to 2.9 pct in February from the record 3.0 pct in
January, the government's Management and Coordination Agency
said.
    The January level was the worst since the Goverment started
compiling unemployment statistics under the current system in
1953.
    Unemployment was up from 2.8 pct a year earlier.
    Unadjusted February unemployment totalled 1.86 mln people,
up from 1.82 mln in January and 1.64 mln a year earlier.
    Male unemployment in February remained at 2.9 pct, equal to
the second-highest level set in January and December. Record
male unemployment of 3.1 pct was set in July 1986.
    Female unemployment rose to a record 3.1 pct in February
from the previous record 3.0 pct marked in January 1987 and in
April, August, September and December last year.
    "Japan's employment condition was still severe in February
as the non-rounded rate of unemployment in February fell only
0.03 percentage points to 2.93 pct from 2.96 pct in January," an
agency official said.
    Employment in manufacturing industries fell 430,000 from a
year earlier to 14.22 mln people in February due to the yen's
continued appreciation, while employment in non-manufacturing
industries rose 380,000 to 12.11 mln.
    In manufacturing industries, employment in the textile
industry fell 180,000 to 1.94 mln in February, while in

Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said he
regards a U.S. Dollar below 150 yen as counter to the agreement
struck by major nations in Paris last month.
    He told the Upper House Budget Committee in Parliament that
Japan intervened in the market when the dollar went below 150
yen, as it considered the dollar's fall below that level
counter to the spirit of the Paris accord.
    Commenting on current foreign exchange movements, Miyazawa
said Japan would watch developments for another couple of days.
    Institutional investors appeared to have sold dollars to
hedge currency risks ahead of the end of the financial year
today, Miyazawa said.
    Behind the recent dollar fall lies the market perception
that major nations were not doing enough to implement their
policies under the Paris pact, he said, noting that passage of
Japan's 1987/88 budget has been delayed.
    He said that now was the time for major nations to act
under the Paris accord. The U.S., West Germany, France,
Switzerland and Britain have intervened on their own account to
prop up the dollar, he said. This was a concerted action.

Commerzbank AG <CBKG.F> said a
dividend of nine marks would be proposed for ordinary
shareholders on 1986 earnings after eight in 1985.
    It added in a statement that parent net profit rose to
288.2 mln marks in 1986 from 221.7 mln the prior year.
    A Commerzbank spokesman noted the figures were,however,
preliminary and required approval of the bank's supervisory
board which meets today.
    The Commerzbank statement added the distributable profit
last year rose to 228.2 mln marks from 161.7 mln in 1985.
    With inclusion of the corporate tax allowance, qualifying
domestic shareholders would receive an effective dividend of
14.06 marks per share.
    Total dividend payout would rise to 186.8 mln marks from
142.0 mln on 1985 earnings due to the increase in the dividend
and in equity capital, it added.
    From the parent net profit, 60 mln marks would be placed in
published reserves, unchanged from the two prior years.
    The shareholders' meeting take place on May 22 in Hamburg.
    The statement said holders of Commerzbank participation
certificates in a total nominal value of 425 mln marks would
receive the remaining 41.4 mln marks of the distributable
profit. Aside from the basic payment of 8.25 pct of nominal
value, certificate holders would receive an additional 1.5 pct.
    The management board of the bank would also propose two
capital measures to shareholders in order to be able to react
quickly to new challenges.
    It would ask for authorised capital of a nominal 200 mln
marks for the issue of new shares and for 300 mln for the issue
of warrant bonds, both for the period until April 30, 1992.

Today's liberalised financial markets are
making it extremely difficult for Japan's monetary authorities
to prevent the yen's rise against the dollar, but they have
several options other than normal intervention, Bank of Japan
sources said.
    A senior central bank official said that such methods as
controlling foreign exchange deals and invoking currency swap
agreements with other central banks, which have not been
invoked since 1978, are all being considered.
    "But the time may not be ripe," he said.
    "In this era of financial liberalisation, it's almost
impossible to control the flow of capital in and out of Japan,"
said another senior bank official.
    But the first official said: "From a technical viewpoint,
the Bank of Japan could activate swap agreements immediately
after other central banks involved agreed to do so."
    A swap agreement, an exchange of currency between two
nations, allows both sides to acquire a ready source of the
other's currency in case of need.
    "If the Bank invokes such swaps, both parties would announce
the decision jointly," said the first official.
    The sources said they believed the limit of currency market
intervention may be being reached after they saw recent
concerted market action by central banks of major industrial
nations was increasingly ineffective in propping up the
battered dollar.
    But intervention is at least an option, they said. Further
easing of monetary policy will be very difficult with an
official discount rate already at a record low of 2.5 pct, they
said.
    Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita has repeatedly ruled
out another rate cut due to fears it could revive inflation.
    One bank official said he could not deny the possibilty of
the Bank of Japan activating currency swap agreements with the
U.S. And other central banks, if these banks continue
intervening to sell the yen in support of the dollar and run
out of their yen cash positions.
    "But we don't think they have become short of yen quite yet,"
he said.
    The bank has established a five billion dlr swap limit with
the U.S. Federal Reserve and another 2.5 billion mark and 200
billion yen limit with the West German and Swiss central banks,
according to the sources.
    Foreign exchange dealers estimate the Fed had sold two
billion dlrs worth of yen from its own account to support the
dollar in New York last week.
    The central bank sources also said Japan may arrange other
currency swap agreements with Britain and France if they find
it necessary, but added they are not actually talking with each
other towards that end.

London and Scottish Marine Oil Plc
(Lasmo) <LASL.L> will have an advantage when oil prices rise
again and it is confident this will happen early in the next
decade, the company said in a statement accompanying results.
    Lasmo said its advantage comes from its reserves of oil and
gas which at the end of 1986 stood at 210 mln barrels of oil
equivalent, a group record. Reserves have increased every year
since 1983 at a compounded rate of 10 pct a year.
    The company reported a 1986 pretax profit of 4.4 mln stg,
down from 118 mln in 1985.
    It said falling oil prices caused the downturn.
    The company said it reacted swiftly to the sharp drop in
oil prices which began over a year ago. Capital expenditure,
which had been budgeted at over 150 mln stg, was cut to 51 mln
stg net of disposals. Managers responded well to the demand for
lower operating costs and this has been achieved worldwide.
    The company said had very few exploration wells committed
for 1987 and therefore retains maximum flexibility in its
exploration program. Even without further success, the existing
fields and recent discoveries will contribute significantly to
profit and cash flow for some years to come, it said.
    Lasmo shares were down 2p at 251 after the announcement.

One or two large West German banks
effectively drained the domestic money market of liquidity at
the end of the month in order to achieve higher rates from
their overnight deposits, money dealers said.
    As a result, call money soared in active trading to around
the Lombard rate of five pct from 3.70/80 pct yesterday as
banks found themselves short of minimum reserve funds.
    Bundesbank figures showed that banks held an average daily
51 billion marks in interest-free minimum reserve assets at the
central bank over the first 29 days of the month.
    Though this was above the March requirement of 50.7
billion, actual holdings at the weekend were 44.2 billion.
    To meet the daily average, dealers said, banks must raise
holdings by two billion marks to 46.3 billion today and
tomorrow. But liquidity was tight in early business because
banks excessively took up the Bundesbank's offer for sale of
Treasury bills on Friday. This provides a rate of 3.50 pct for
three-day deposits and is an effective floor to the market.
    Though some liquidity, from bills bought on Thursday,
flowed back into the market today, the bulk would not return
until tomorrow, the start of the new month, dealers said.
    Dealers said the large banks, which they did not name,
commanded short-term money requirements of as much as five
billion marks or so.
    With a knowledge of their own needs until the end of the
month, the banks bought excessive amounts of treasury bills,
draining liquidity for three days. When other banks sought
funds, rates rose and large banks were able to place excess
funds on deposit at a considerably higher average return.
    One senior dealer said the Bundesbank, with advanced
knowledge of the market's needs, should have curtailed its
sales of treasury bills on Friday.
    Though dealers only late in the day learn of the total
minimum reserve holdings of the previous day, the Bundesbank
has an immediate overview of the situation and could anticipate
the strength of demand for funds the following day, he said.
    "(Bundesbank dealers) could easily have said we are not
selling any treasury bills or we're not selling them in this
amount," he said. "If the Bundesbank wants to finely steer the
market then they should avoid such excesses. Tomorrow it will
be different. Call money will fall back to 4.0 pct or so."
    But the Bundesbank would not approve of the sharp jump in
rates, given the delicate state of currency markets.
    International central banks have been at pains to prevent a
dollar fall against major currencies, including the mark.
Dealers said a rise in call money gives the mark a firmer
undertone, contributing to downward pressure on the dollar.
    "The whole tender policy is to have a call money of between
three and four pct. In that case the excesses as we have today
cannot be very popular," the senior dealer said.
    Dealers said the large banks probably achieved average
rates of return on their excess funds of between 3.75 pct or
four pct. This is a higher return than they would have earned
without the excessive draining through the treasury bill
mechanism.
    Because of the currency situation and the wage negotiations
between Germany's major employers and the unions, the
Bundesbank would be very unlikely to make any changes to
monetary policy at its council meeting on Thursday, they said.
    Bundesbank figures showed that banks fell back on the
Lombard emergency funding facility to draw down 1.5 billion
marks yesterday as rates began to tighten in late business.

Mannesmann AG <MMWG.F> expects a
difficult year for the capital goods industry in 1987, chief
executive Werner Dieter told a news conference.
    Dieter said West German producers would see a downturn in
foreign business because of lower energy prices and the higher
mark, as well as a deterioration of the economies of customer
nations.
    Domestic business was also declining and orders for West
German engineering goods have been falling since July 1986,
Dieter said.
    Mannesmann's profit fell by an undisclosed amount in 1986.
    Dieter said Mannesmann's pipe activities would suffer a
set- back, although measures to cut costs, which were started
last year, were now having an effect.
    Dieter noted, however, that pipes and related products
accounted for less than 30 pct of Mannesmann's turnover. The
company saw good chances in the automation sector, which Dieter
said had become one of Mannesmann's "strategic aims."
    He said the company's drive to combine activities in
mechanical and electronic engineering was a particular "plus
point" for Mannesmann.
    Mannesmann, which yesterday announced it had agreed to take
a majority stake in the Fichtel und Sachs AG car parts group
for an undisclosed sum, saw third party group turnover fall
nine pct in 1986 to 16.60 billion marks. Its world group net
profit in 1985 was 255.9 mln marks.
    It has blamed the fall in 1986 profits on the weaker dollar
and lack of demand for steel pipe.
    Dieter said there were signs that prices for steel pipe
were bottoming out and would slowly start to rise, but he added
the company would continue to cut personnel in this sector this
year.

The Bank of Japan will sell tomorrow a

holdings to help absorb a projected money market surplus of
1,700 billion yen, money traders said.
    Of the total, 300 billion yen will yield 3.8992 pct on

    The remaining 500 billion yen will yield 3.8990 pct in a

    The repurchase agreement yields compare with the 3.8750 pct
one-month commercial bill discount rate today and the 4.28/11
pct rate on one-month certificates of deposit.
    Tomorrow's surplus is attributable to excess bank holdings
from sales of yen to buy dollars and to huge cash amounts to be

Japan plans to work out a drastic set of pump-priming measures
immediately after Parliament passes the 1987/88 budget.

loss for the financial year ending last October, compared with
a record pre-tax profit of 21.7 mln stg in 1985, chairman Sir

    A decline in U.S. Transatlantic traffic following terrorist

East traffic were the main causes of the loss, Thomson said.

The U.S. index of leading indicators
rose a seasonally adjusted 0.7 pct in February after a revised
0.5 pct January fall, the Commerce Department said.
    The department previously said the index fell 1.0 pct in
January.
    The February increase left the index at 187.1 over its 1967
base of 100, and was led by a rise in stock prices.
    A total of four of nine indicators available for February
contributed to the increase in the index.
    Besides stock prices, they were manufacturers' new orders
for consumer goods and materials, average work week and
building permits.
    Five of nine indicators were negative. They were change in
sensitive materials prices, money supply, vendor performance,
average weekly initial claims for state unemployment insurance,
and contracts and orders for plant and equipment.
    The main factor in the January revision was contracts and
orders for plant and equipment, the department said.
    December also was revised to a 2.4 pct rise from an earlier
2.3 pct rise due to a change in outstanding credit.
    The index of coincident indicators, which measures the
current economy, rose 0.9 pct in February after a decline of
1.3 pct in January and a rise of 0.9 pct in December.
    The index of lagging indicators, which measures past
economic activity, decreased 0.3 pct in February after
increasing 1.7 pct in January and falling by 0.5 pct in
December.

Aluminium capacity expansion planned for
the period after 1990 will be insufficient to supply any
acceleration in demand growth, let alone an increase on the
scale which seems likely, according to analyst Anthony Bird
Associates' 1987 Aluminium Review.
    By 1995 non-socialist world primary capacity will need to
be around 18 mln tonnes, whereas on current plans only 15 mln
tonnes are scheduled, Bird said.
    Bird forecast higher economic growth after 1990 and
increased imports by less developed countries.
    Aluminium consumption growth is not expected to accelerate
by as much as general growth, but non-socialist world
consumption is nevertheless forecast to increase sharply from
13.77 mln tonnes in 1990 to 17.25 mln tonnes in 1995, Bird
said.
    Aluminium companies were slow to adjust to the pace of
change after 1973, the review said, and now they have completed
this transition they may be in danger of remaining preoccupied
with the strategies of retrenchment and survival which have
served them well in recent years.
    In order to encourage the construction of additional
smelters aluminium prices will need to settle at a higher
level.
    Production costs are likely to rise again in the years
ahead as the glut of alumina capacity vanishes and electricity
suppliers take a more aggressive line with aluminium companies,
according to the review.
    At March 1987 prices the three most likely cost-price
scenarios call for a long-run aluminium price of between 73 and
89.5 cents a lb, depending on exchange rates, Bird said.
    Such a price development is not expected to cause any
marked competitive problems for the metal because of the likely
rise in commodity prices as a whole and cost pressures in the
pipeline for steel and copper.
    In the short term, however, the outlook is dull, Bird said,
as the world economy has not responded well to the
opportunities offered by cheap oil.
    Its 1987 consumption forecast of 13.01 mln tonnes is 0.4
pct down on 1986, while production is forecast six pct higher
in 1987 at 12.67 mln tonnes.

French channel
tunnel consortium, needs to launch its planned 7.7-billion
franc third stage capital increase by end July to cover ongoing
project costs, French co-chairman Andre Benard said today.
    If the proposed public share offering was delayed beyond
then, Eurotunnel would have to find bridging finance, he told
reporters during a visit by French parliamentarians to the
construction site of the French tunnel terminal.
    Early elections in Britain could cause such a delay, he
noted.
    Britain's lower house of Parliament last month passed a
bill endorsing the construction of the 50-km (31-mile) tunnel.
The bill still needs approval of the upper house of Lords.
    Benard said the consortium had decided after lengthy
discussion to issue an identical mix of securities in the
London and Paris markets, but details of the precise package
had still to be decided.
    The offering would comprise approximately three billion
francs in each market with another 1.5 billion offered in the
United States, Japan and other European markets. Timing will be
set to take account of the French privatisation program.
   Earlier this month a Eurotunnel official said the
ratification bill should go before the National Assembly (lower
house) early next month before passing to the Senate (upper
house) at the end of May.
    Eurotunnel officials expect work on the sites to start in
December or January. The tunnel should be completed by 1993 for
an overall cost of 50 billion francs.

NL Industries Inc said it would seek
an alternative to current plans to spin off its chemical
operations if an affiliate tries to block the plan.
    The company said the lessor of an NL Chemicals pigment
making plant in Leverkusen, West Germany, has indicated the
plan, without the lessors consent, would allow the lessor
 to buy the plant and terminate a
supplies and services agreement.
    NL said it disagrees with the lessor's position and will
seek its consent to the spin-off. If the lessor does not
consent, NL will pursue an alternative that will result in the
separation of its chemicals and petroleum services businesses.
    NL said it believes the alternative form of the separation
would not require the lessor's consent, which would not be
sought. The alternative would require approval by NL
shareholders and other parties, which should be attainable, it
said.
    As previously announced, NL plans to distribute shares of
NL Chemicals Inc common stock as a spin-off, through redemption
of NL's Series C preferred stock depositary receipts, when the
redemption is not likely to result in significant tax liability
to either NL or NL Chemicals.
    NL also said it may consider paying the redemption value of
the Series C preferred stock in cash instead of implementing
the spin-off or the alternative for separating the two
businesses.
    Under terms of the Series C preferred, NL at any time may
redeem the stock for cash. At Feb 28, 1987, the redemption
value was about 15 dlrs per depositary receipt, it said.

Representatives of U.S. sugar grower
organizations said they expect some increase the area planted
to sugarbeets this year and said the prospects for the 1987
cane sugar crop also are good.
    Dave Carter, president of the U.S. beet sugar association,
said plantings may be up in two major beet growing states,
California and Michigan, while sowings could be down slightly
in the largest producing state of Minnesota.
    Overall, Carter predicted beet plantings would rise in the
midwest, and this coupled with increases in California would
increase U.S. sugarbeet plantings slightly from the 1.232 mln
acres sown last year.
    USDA later today releases its first estimate of 1987 U.S.
sugarbeet plantings in the prospective plantings report.
    The main reason for the expected increase in beet sowings
is that returns from competing crops such as soybeans and
grains are "just awful," said Carter.
    In the midwest, bankers are strongly encouraging farmers to
plant sugarbeets because the U.S. sugar program offers a loan
rate of 18 cents per pound and because payments to farmers from
beet processors are spread evenly over the growing season, said
Luther Markwart, executive vice president of the American
sugarbeet growers association.
    "The banks are putting a lot of pressure on these guys,"
Markwart said.
    In some areas there are waiting lists of farmers seeking a
contract with processors to plant beets, Markwart said.
    USDA's report today will not include any harvested area
estimates for sugarcane, but representatives of Florida, Hawaii
and Louisiana growers said crop prospects are good.
    Horis Godfrey, a consultant representing Florida and Texas
cane growers, said Florida cane is off to a good start  because
for the first time in several years there was no winter freeze.
Although area to be harvesteed is about the same as last year,
cane production may be up in Florida this year, he said.
    In Hawaii, area harvested may decline slightly this year,
but likely will be offset again in 1987 by increased yields,
said Eiler Ravnholt, vice president of the Hawaiian Sugar
Planters Association.
    The acreage planted to sugarbeets will receive more than
the usual amount of attention this year because of mounting
concern that continued increases in domestic sugar production
threaten the U.S. sugar program, industry sources said.
    The increases in beet plantings have especially caused
concern among cane growers who have not expanded plantings,
particularly in Hawaii, industry officials said.
    "We haven't had a good weather year throughout the beet and
cane areas in more than five years," said Godfrey, adding that
the U.S. may be due for a good weather year.
    Rep. Jerry Huckaby, D-La., chairman of the House
agriculture subcommittee responsible for the sugar program, has
threatened to offer legislation next year to curb domestic
sweetener output if growers fail to restrain output in 1987.

New orders for manufactured goods
rose 8.0 billion dlrs, or 4.3 pct, in February to a seasonally
adjusted 194.6 billion dlrs, the Commerce Department said.
    It was the largest one month rise in orders since a 4.8 pct
increase in September 1986, the department said.
    The February gain followed a revised orders drop in January
of 5.3 pct, the largest drop on record since the department
revised the statistics in 1982.
    The January decline was originally reported as 4.0 pct.
    Excluding defense orders factory orders rose 3.2 pct in
February after a 3.9 pct January decline.
    The new orders rise in February included an increase in
durable goods orders of 6.4 billion dlrs, or 6.7 pct, to 101.9
billion dlrs. The department had estimated on March 24 that
February durable goods orders rose 6.0 pct.
    New orders for nondurable goods  were up 1.6 billion dlrs,
or 1.8 pct, in February to 92.7 billion dlrs, the department
said.
    These figures compared with a January decline of 9.8 pct in
durables orders and no change in nondurables orders in January.
    Defense orders rose 2.2 billion dlrs, or 47.8 pct, in
February after falling 38.5 pct in January.
    Orders for nondefense capital goods gained a slight 0.1 pct
in February after falling 8.6 pct in January.
    Within major industry categories, orders increases were
widespread. Transportation equipment was up 12.5 pct after
falling by 17.9 pct in January.
    Primary metals orders rose 12.7 pct in February after
dropping by 20.1 pct in January.
    Electrical machinery orders rose 6.9 pct in February after
dropping 15.4 pct in January.
    February shipments were up 5.8 billion dlrs, or 3.0 pct to
195.7 billion dlrs after falling 3.9 pct in January.
    Unfilled orders declined 1.1 billion dlrs, or 0.3 pct, to
369.4 billion dlrs.  It was the third consecutive monthly
decline in unfilled orders, the department said.

The Kansas City Board of Trade,
KCBT, has asked federal futures regulators to modify a proposal
to raise the Chicago Board of Trade's, CBT, speculative
position limits on wheat futures contracts, saying the plan
would put the the Kansas exchange "at a serious competitive
disadvantage."
    The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, CFTC, last month
proposed raising CBT wheat speculative limits to 1,200
contracts all months net from 600 contracts, and to 900
contracts for any single month from 600 contracts.
    At the same time, CFTC proposed leaving KCBT's wheat
speculative position limits unchanged.
    "Higher limits for CBT wheat than for KCBT wheat would
significantly impair the KCBT's ability to compete with the CBT
for speculative interest," Michael Braude, president of the
Kansas exchange, said in a letter to CFTC.
    A CFTC spokesman said the commission took into account open
interest affected by existing speculative limits in proposing
to raise CBT's limits.
    KCBT said the CFTC proposal would reduce hedging
efficiency, constrain growth of intermarket spreading and of
the exchange's wheat options contract and impair its ability to
attract large speculators.
    The Kansas City exchange asked the commission to amend its
proposal to change the limits for KCBT wheat to the exact same
bushel amount as specified for CBT wheat.
    CFTC will consider public comments on the proposal until
June 3.

Keycorp said it has signed a
definitive agreement to acquire Commercial Security Bancorp
<CSEC> by exchanging Keycorp common valued at 63 dlrs for each
Commercial Securities share.
    Keycorp said this gives the transaction an indicated value
of 102 mln dlrs.
    Keycorp said the amount of its stock to be exchanged will
be based on the daily average closing price of the shares for
an unspecified period prior to the closing of the acquisition.
    Based on a maximum of about 2.75 Keycorp shares and a
minimum of about 1.8 Keycorp to be exchanged, the agreement
provides that if the average price of Keycorp common is less
than 21.50 dlrs a share during the pricing period, the
agreement will terminate unless a new conversion ratio can be
negotiated.
    Keycorp said the transaction is designed to be tax free to
Commercial Security shareholders. The company said it will
treat the merger as a pooling of interests.
    It said the proposal is subject to approval by Commercial
Security shareholders and various regulators.
    Keycorp said the merger is expected to become effective as
soon as possible after December 31, 1987, the date Utah's
interstate banking law becomes operational.
    Keycorp said Richard K. Hemingway and certain members of
the Hemingway family who own about 30 pct of Commercial
Security's outstanding shares have agreed to vote in favor of
the transaction and not dispose of their stock.
     Based in Salt Lake City, Commercial Security ended 1986
with assets of 830.3 mln dlrs, net loans of 496.6 mln dlrs and
deposits of 707.9 mln dlrs. It had net income of 5.1 mln dlrs

Exxon Corp said in its annual report
that it raised production in 1986 although it did not replace
all oil and gas produced.
    The company said that it added about four pct to production
bringing it to 1.8 mln bpd, the highest level since 1979, based
largely on increased production of oil overseas but additions
to its reserves from new discoveries and reserve acquisitions
did not replace all of the oil and gas produced.
    The company said that the average price for oil and gas
declined 41 pct in 1986 from the previous year sparking a 38
pct decline in its earnings from exploration and production.
    Exxon's earnings from exploration and production in 1986
fell to 3.1 billion dlrs from 4.9 billion dlrs in 1985.
    Exxon said that its principal gains in production came from
the Gulf of Mexico, Alaska, the North Sea, Malaysia and from
oil sands in Canada.
    Exxon also said that it acquired 11.2 mln acres for
expoloration spread over 10 countries including the U.S, Europe
and the Far East.
    But capital expenditures for exploration and production
were cut to 4.6 billion dlrs from 7.6 billion the previous year
and further reductions were expected in 1987.
    Exxon said that its net share of crude oil and natural gas
liquids produced from offshore fields in the North Sea reached
a new high of 422,000 bpd.
    The light, sweet crudes produced from these North Sea
fields also gave the company trading gains as Exxon was able to
sell much of this crude and replace it with cheaper, lower
quality crude oil for its refineries which have been upgraded
over the past several years.
    The trading gains and lower acquisition costs gave Exxon
more of a spread in its refinery operations and added to
earnings gains from refining and marketing.
    Exxon said earnings from refining and marketing operations
rose to nearly two billion dlrs in 1986, up from 872 mln dlrs
in 1985.
    The company said petroleum sales slipped slightly to 4.043
mln barrels per day from 4.082 mln bpd in 1985 while crude runs
rose to 3.0 mln bpd from 2.9 mln bpd the previous year.
    Exxon's refinery operations benefited from a three year 500
mln dlr upgrading program to its Baytown, Texas refinery
completed last October and an 850 mln dlr upgrading project in
Rotterdam both of which emphasize utilizing lower grade crudes
to extract higher proportions of light products.

A plan by European producers to sell

    Last week Beghin-Say president Jean-Marc Vernes said a
possible settlement of a row with the EC would lead producers
to withdraw their offer, which was made as a protest against EC
export licensing policies.
    The EC policy is to offer export rebates, which fail to
give producers an equivalent price to that which they would get
by offering sugar into intervention stocks, Vernes said.

that producers had no intention of withdrawing the sugar offer
already lodged with intervention boards of different European
countries. He said final quality approval for all the sugar
offered could come later this week. Some 95 pct had already
cleared quality specifications.
    The EC can only reject an offer to sell into intervention
stocks on quality grounds. Minguzzi added that under EC
regulations, the Community has until early May to pay for the
sugar. He declined to put an exact figure on the amount of
sugar offered by Beghin-Say, but said it was below 500,000

Exxon Corp said that 1986's 15 pct
increase in earnings per share to 7.42 dlrs a share were
partially based on its streamlined operations which compensated
for the weakness in its exploration earnings and the lowest
crude oil prices in a decade.
    Exxon said economies introduced in its operations from
reductions in personnel and other savings, such as reductions
in exploration expenses, were reflected in an 880 mln dlr
reduction in consolidated operating costs from 1985.
    The company said its more efficient operations would be
necessary to offset more adverse oil market conditions ahead.
    The company also said that its share repurchase plan
contributed to the per share gains over 1985.
    In a breakdown of costs, Exxon said that operating expenses
slipped to 9.2 billion dlrs in 1986 from 9.7 billion dlrs the
previous year and exploration expenses, including dry holes,
slipped back to 1.2 billion dlrs from 1.5 billion dlrs over the
same period as the number of wells drilled was lower.
    The company was also able to use lower interest rates to
reduce its interest expenses to 614 mln dlrs in 1986 from 627
mln dlrs the previous year.
    Exxon said that the ratio of debt to capital was cut by 1.6
pct in 1986 from the previous year to 19 pct.
    On December 31, 1986 Exxon's total debt of 7.87 billion
dlrs was down slightly from the previous year's 7.9 billion
dlrs and long term debt stood at 4.3 billion dlrs, down from
4.8 billion dlrs in 1985.
    Exxon's policy of repurchasing shares on the market for its

A new grade of unleaded gasoline
now being test marketed will increase refining costs when
refiners can least afford it, according to officials attending
the National Petroleum Refiners Association conference here.
    The new grade of unleaded gasoline has an octane level of
89 compared with over 90 for super unleaded and 87 for regular
unleaded gasoline.
     Amoco Corp <AN> has test-marketed the new mid-grade
gasoline and hopes to sell it on a regular basis in the South,
East and Midwest by the beginning of June, according to Paul
Collier, executive vice president of marketing.
    Phillips Petroleum <P> expects to begin marketing the new
89 octane unleaded gasoline in May, sources said.
    Converting current refinery operations to produce the 89
octane unleaded gsoline could cost hundreds of millions of
dollars per refinery but that depends on the present capacity
and intensity of the refinery, said Amoco's Collier.
    But not all oil company's welcome the introduction of
another grade of unleaded gasoline.
    "Three grades are not warranted," said Henry Rosenberg,
chairman of Crown Central Petroleum <CNP>. "Refiners will have
to upgrade again," he added.
    "An investment will have to be made," said Archie Dunham,
executive vice president of petroleum products at Conoco, an
operating subsidiary of DuPont Corp <DD> in order to upgrade
refinery operations.

Canadian Pacific Ltd's principal aim
over the next few years will be to significantly increase the
company's return on equity, it said in the annual report.
    Canadian Pacific's return on average capital employed fell
to 4.7 pct in 1986 from 5.9 pct in the prior year. Return on
average shareholders' equity declined to 2.5 pct from 4.8 pct
in 1985.
    "To achieve this goal will require that the businesses
comprising Canadian Pacific are leaders in their respective
fields," the company said in the report to shareholders.
    "Although the steps already taken to reposition and solidify
Canadian Pacific point to a better financial performance in
1987, more remains to be accomplished if the company is to
produce returns that meet shareholder expectations," it said.
    Canadian Pacific previously reported 1986 operating net
profit fell to 150.1 mln dlrs from 252.7 mln dlrs in the prior
year. Revenues were 15.02 billion dlrs compared to 15.04
billion dlrs in 1985.
    It said emphasis will continue on reducing dependence on
cyclical industries and strengthening the asset mix.
    Canadian Pacific said 1986 results were disappointing, but
the company took several steps towards reviewing assets and
operations and rationalizing its asset base.
    As previously reported, it sold its 52.5 pct interest in
Cominco Ltd <CLT> for 472 mln dlrs in October, 1986 and
Canadian Pacific Airlines Ltd for 300 mln dlrs in January,
1987.
    Including other asset sales, Canadian Pacific's
consolidated assets fell to 17.70 billion dlrs at year end from
21.3 billion dlrs at the end of 1985, it said.
    The company also took extraordinary charges of 230.4 mln
dlrs in 1986, resulting in a loss of 80.3 mln dlrs for the
year.
    The charges consisted of a 362.5 mln dlr writedown
representing permanent impairment in asset values, partially
offset by a gain of 102.6 mln dlrs on sale of its interest in
Cominco and a gain of 29.5 mln dlrs on sale of CP Hotels'
flight kitchens.
    Canadian Pacific said a further extraordinary net gain of
172.5 mln dlrs from the airline unit sale will be included in
first quarter results.
    Canadian Pacific said despite lower earnings and
extraordinary charges, its overall cash position strengthened
in 1986 as cash generated from operations and asset sales was
more than sufficient to finance capital expenditures of 1.80
billion dlrs.
    Long term debt fell to 4.50 billion dlrs from 6.22 billion
dlrs in 1985.
    Consolidated 1987 capital spending will be reduced
considerably from 1986 levels, mainly due to the Cominco and
air line unit sales, it said. Spending commitments totalled 239
mln dlrs at the end of 1986.

The company also took extraordinary charges of 230.4 mln dlrs
in 1986, resulting in a loss of 80.3 mln dlrs for the year.
    The charges consisted of a 362.5 mln dlr writedown

Arvin Industries Inc said higher
interest costs from borrowings to make acquisitions will
produce earnings flat with last year's 59 cts a share results.
    Arvin said it might earn 57 cts to 60 cts a share in the

    These results also reflect the seasonally low sales pattern
of automotive replacement parts in that period.
    Arvin forecast about 85 cts a share net in the second
quarter compared with 68 cts in last year's period.
    The company said revenues for full year 1987 it will exceed
1.4 billion dlrs, net earnings will increase more than 30 pct,
while per share earnings should increase 12 to 18 pct.
    Arvin's 1986 revenues were 995.6 mln, net reached 41.2 mln

    It based these forecasts due to the addition of Schrader
Automotive Inc and Maremont Corp, both acquired last year.

not conform to historical patterns for the year because the
acquisitions of Schrader and Maremond occurred in different

Exxon Corp said that it will move to
protect its directors from liabilities arising from lawsuits
charging gross negligence.
    Exxon said directors' liabilities will be limited and they
will be indemnified for actions taken in pursuit of duties.
    The company said it was taking the opportunity to change
its bylaws and incoroporation certificate following changes in
the law of New Jersey, where the company is incoporated.
    The measures are being submitted to shareholders and will
be voted on at Exxon's annual meeting to be held May 21 in New
Orleans the company said in proxy material sent to
shareholders.
    Shareholders are being asked to approve an amendment to the
company's certificate to eliminate directors' maximum personal
monetary liability to the limit New Jersey allows.
    New Jersey recently permitted corporations to eliminate
monetary liability directors and owners may incur for breach of
duty care owed by them to corporations and shareholders.
    The company said that the principal effect of the measure
"will be to eliminate potential monetary damage actions against
directors."
    But the amendment will only limit liability in the event of
unintentional errors.
    It does not limit their liability for actions taken in
knowing violation of the law, nor will it limit potential
liabilities from violations of federal securities laws, the
company said in its proxy statemernt.
    A second measure proposed to shareholders is an amendment
to bylaws already voted on by the directors at their January
Board meeting making indeminifiacation of directors mandatory.
    Exxon said that it had currently purchased such insurance
from a captive insurance copany in the amount of 50 mln dlrs in

West German Economics Minister Martin
Bangemann urged a halt to the talking down of the dollar by
both official and private institutions in the U.S., Saying calm
was needed on the foreign exchanges.
    Speaking at the opening of the 40th Hanover Industry Fair,
Bangemann said radical changes in foreign exchange parities had
left their mark on exports and investments. He added that
without these external difficulties, West Germany's economy
would have grown by 3.5 pct last year instead of the 2.5 pct
reported.
    Bangemann said he could not deny that the economic climate
in West Germany had cooled, but he stressed the country was not
in a downtrend.
    The minister also criticised state subsidies, which he said
mainly favoured large companies and created a tax burden for
smaller and medium sized firms.
    Bangemann referred specifically to subsidies in the steel
industry, which he said had to be fought with all legal means
when they did not correspond to European Community guidelines
on grants.
    He added that in light of the declining demand for steel
capacities had to be adjusted, saying the Bonn government would
not successfully be able to stand in the way of any change in
this industry.
    Bangemann also spoke out against protectionism and called
for more competition, citing as an example the Federal Post
Office.
    The Post Office enjoys a monopoly in West Germany,
especially as far as deciding who is able to provide
telecommunications equipment.

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
said it was stepping up compliance efforts by its international
staff to recover some of the billions of dollars lost each year
in unpaid taxes.
    The agency was shifting emphasis by its international
branch to increase compliance by the 47,000 foreign-owned
American companies and foreign firms operating in the United
States, IRS officials said at a news conference.
    The IRS also was taking a closer look at compliance by
Americans living abroad and by taxpayers in the United States
with income from overseas investments.
    Percy Woodard, assistant IRS commissioner, international,
denied that the agency was picking on foreign companies, but he
said fewer of them pay taxes than comparable U.S. firms.
    In some industries, one pct of foreign firms paid U.S.
taxes, he said. Other IRS staff said the taxes paid by foreign
companies ranged from 16 to 19 pct less than taxes paid by U.S.
firms.
    "If our taxpayers in another country are expected to fulfill
their tax-paying responsibilities in that country, then
foreigners in our country can be expected to do the same thing,"
Woodard said.
    In addition, as many as 61 pct of the 2.5 mln Americans who
live abroad do not file tax returns, costing the government 2.3
billion dlrs a year, Woodard said.
    The total tax gap -- the difference between taxes owed and
actually paid to the government -- is about 90 billion dlrs.
    Millions of dollars are lost because Americans fail to
report foreign income and because U.S. businesses with foreign
operations can underreport income, Woodard said.
    The IRS will increase compliance by reassigning 100    
examiners to international tax returns, a 25-pct increase,
which should lead to more tax return audits.
    The IRS will study entire industries to spot trends or
practices by foreign-owned companies in their compliance with
tax laws, Woodard said.
    The IRS looked at the electronics industry first, but
Woodard denied it was because of the trade dispute over
semiconductors between the United States and Japan.
    The agency next will turn its attention to the automobile,
computer and motorcycle industries.
    The IRS will also receive information on anyone who applies
for a U.S. passport or permanent residence in the United States
to help indentify those who do not file returns.

Canada's airline industry, shaken up by
a recent merger that creates a powerful new competitor for
government-owned Air Canada, has begun its first serious drive
for profitability in 50 years, industry analysts said.
    "Now we've got a company that can compete with Air Canada,"
said Thomas Bradley of Richardson Greenshields of Canada Ltd.
"Clearly, it can go head-to-head in any market."
    The new airline, which arose from the 300-mln-Canadian-dlr
takeover of Canadian Pacific Air Lines Ltd by the small but
cash-rich Pacific Western Airlines Corp, was launched last week
as Canadian Airlines International Ltd.
    Canadian Airlines will have 35-40 pct of the
6-billion-Canadian-dlr domestic market, against Air Canada's
50-55 pct. Wardair International Ltd is third with about nine
pct.
    Analysts believe Pacific Western's aggressive and
cost-conscious chairman Rhys Eyton will develop the true
potential of the former CP Air, which floundered for four
decades inside the bureaucracy of conglomerate Canadian Pacific
Ltd.
    They said CP Air's management style had been not much
different from that of Air Canada, formed 50 years ago, because
neither airline was held accountable to its owners.
    "Not that long ago, maybe even just six months ago, these
two airlines were totally fiscally irresponsible. Neither
seemed that concerned about the bottom line," said Bradley.
    "But with CP Air being run by Eyton, it will be very
conscious of profitability and shareholder return. And Air
Canada is on the verge of going that way," he said.
    CP Air, always fighting for market share rather than
profits, was "a perennial money-loser," analyst Wilfred Hahn of
Bache Securities Inc said in a recent report.
    Prior to its takeover in December, it had accumulated
long-term debt of 600 mln Canadian dlrs. From 1981 to 1985, its
losses totaled 87 mln Canadian dlrs.
    Air Canada, widely expected to be privatized later this
year in a public share offering, lost 14.8 mln Canadian dlrs on
revenues of 2.72 billion dlrs in 1985. It has a debt of more
than 2 billion dlrs.
    Although only a minority interest is likely to be sold to
the public, the prospect of privatization at a time of
increased competition is forcing Air Canada to pay more
attention to finances, analysts said.
    It recently disclosed that it expects to report a profit "in
excess of 35 mln to 40 mln dlrs" for 1986. However, this profit
recovery was due less to management skill than the fact that
all Canadian airlines had a good year in 1986, analysts said.
    Tourists came to Canada in record numbers last year,
attracted by the relatively weak Canadian dollar and Expo 86 in
Vancouver, which alone had more than 22 mln visitors.
    For the next few years, most analysts see three-six pct air
traffic growth, and they expect profits will come from
cost-cutting and careful spending.
    Peter Friend of Walywn Stodgell Cochran Murray Ltd said
institutional buyers will be eager to add Air Canada to their
portfolios as a blue-chip investment, but warned that new
competition makes profit growth less certain.
    "The airline with something to lose will be Air Canada. At
one time, it had a fixed system which was theirs and nobody
else's," Friend said.
    Many analysts recommend that investors buy and hold airline
shares for at least a year.
    Analysts said Air Canada's immediate concern ahead of a
public stock offering will be unloading unprofitable air routes
without setting off a political storm.
    It also will be faced with an expensive but necessary
updating of its aging fleet of 111 aircraft.
    Wardair, preferring strong medicine now instead of later,
already has embarked on a one-billion-Canadian-dlr purchase of
a dozen aircraft from Europe's Airbus Industrie.
    Canadian Airlines, which has 81 aircraft, last week ordered
six commuter planes from British Aerospace and said it would
soon buy as many as six wide-bodied aircraft from Airbus or the
Boeing Co.
    Analysts said Canadian Airlines, with its newer fleet,
needs to make fewer replacements and can afford these without
hurting profits.
    Steven Garmaise of Wood Gundy Inc expects Canadian
Airlines' profit in 1988 will more than double last year's 29.8
mln Canadian dlrs by Pacific Western.

Tonight's American Petroleum Institute
weekly inventory report is expected to show moderate drawdowns
in distillates and gasoline stocks for the week ended March 27,
analysts and traders said.
    They said they expect gasoline stocks to fall three mln
barrels or less and heating oil inventories to drop between 1.3
and four mln barrels.
    Some analysts see crude stocks falling by as much as six
mln barrels, while others think they could go up as much as 3.5
mln barrels. Crude oil runs are expected to be unchanged from
the previous week or slightly higher or lower.
    For the week ended March 20, the API said gasoline stocks
fell 2.7 mln barrels. Mosts analysts expect a modest draw for
the week ended March 27. They said stocks could fall between
700,000 and three mln barrels. Some said there is also a chance
gasoline stocks will be unchanged.
    API said distillate stocks dropped four mln barrels for the
week ended March 20. Analysts and traders generally predict a
similar or smaller depletion for last week. They said stock
levels could drop 1.3 to four mln barrels.
    The analysts attribute product stockdraws to seasonal
factors but they said crude direction is harder to call.
    Crude inventories rose 8.5 mln barrels in the week ended
March 20, API said. Analysts are looking for build of between
3.5 mln barrels to a six mln barrel draw for the week ended
March 27.
    API reported the amount of refinery capacity utilized up
three pct for the week ended March 20. Analysts said
utilization could have remained unchanged, or rose or fell by
less than one pct for the week ended March 27.
    Moderate product stockdraws would strengthen the market
slightly, analysts said. But bullish expectations are already
partially reflected in today's gains, they added.

A. William Reynolds, chairman and
chief executive of GenCorp Inc, told shareholders he expects to
announce a company alternative to a 100-dlr-per-share hostile
tender within a week.
    Last night the company urged shareholders to reject the
tender. Reynolds urged shareholders to be patient, saying the
group sponsoring the tender offer had months to evaluate
GenCorp while "we have had only 10 days to respond."
    Reynolds also disclosed the company has resolved legal
challenges to its planned sale of WOR TV, serving the New York
City market, and expects to complete the sale by Friday.
    Reynolds said the company expects to book an after tax gain
of 250 mln dlrs from the sale of WOR TV. The company plans to
sell the station to MCA Inc <MCA> for 387 mln dlrs.
    Reynolds did not specify whether the legal challenges were
dropped or dismissed. The Federal Communications Commission has
already approved the station's sale.
    Money from the sale of the station will play a role in
helping develop an alternative to the tender offer co-sponsored
by AFG Industries Inc <AFG> and Wagner and Brown, Reynolds
said. He provided no other details.
    Randall Hubbard, chairman of AFG, and Joel Reed, chief
financial officer of Wagner and Brown, attended the meeting,
which was shifted from a tire plant to a downtown hotel. About
300 people were present despite an overnight snowstorm.
    Hubbard and Reed chatted briefly with Reynolds after the
meeting but declined to discuss their proposal with reporters.
    Reynolds told the shareholders friends and family members
have been telling him "Bill, just don't pay greenmail" to end
the takeover threat. Greenmail describes a buyout of a minority
shareholder at a price not available to other holders. Reynolds
said he considers it a "repugnant device."
    Shareholders elected management's slate of 11 directors.
Mario Gabelli, head of a New York investment firm which owns a
large block of stock, proposed one nominee for the board.
Gabelli said the unsuccessful attempt was designed to "stiffen
the backbone of the board to discourage greenmail."
    Hubbard and Reed reiterated previous statements that they
are open to negotiations with GenCorp.
    Asked about severance contracts for key executives in the
event of a shift in control of the company, Reynolds asserted
"we're developing alternatives that would not result in a
change in control."
    Asked whether the company's plan would be superior to any
proposal of AFG and Wagner and Brown, Reynolds commented, "We
know the company, we know the values and we know the
opportunities better than any outside group."
    In response to a question about whether any units are up
for sale, he said only that GenCorp is evaluating alternatives.

Borg-Warner Corp will vigorously
resist GAF Corp's 46-dlr-per-share takeover offer, but the
Midwest conglomerate may fall prey to another offer,
either from GAF or its own management, analysts believe.
    Analysts also said Borg-Warner may attempt to escape GAF
through a restructuring. The speculation pushed Borg-Warner's
stock up 1-3/8 to 48-1/2 in heavy trading.
    Analysts predicted feisty GAF Chairman Samuel Heyman will
stage a tough campaign to gain control of Borg-Warner so he can
add its profitable plastics and chemical business to GAF.
    "It seems from at least their dealing with (raider Irwin)
Jacobs that they don't want to be taken over. The question is
now do they acquiesce to GAF. I think instinctively, they want
to remain independent," said Dudley Heer of Duff and Phelps.
    Borg-Warner has been under siege by takeover speculation
for almost a year. Last week, Jacobs' investment vehicle,
Minstar Inc, and an investor group sold its 10.1 mln
Borg-Warner shares. The same day, GAF Corp raised its stake by
9.1 mln shares to 19.9 pct of the outstanding.
    Jacobs was interested in buying the company, but took no
steps toward a transaction.
    "Their (Borg-Warner) policy has been to stonewall them for
the last nine months. It's been one of the dullest corporate
battles I've seen," said one analyst.
    The battle, however, has heated up, and the range of
breakup values on Wall Street span from the current market
price to almost 60 dlrs per share. Most analysts said they
think a price in the low 50s would be appropriate.
    Arbitragers speculate that GAF will not give up easily on
its 3.16 billion dlr offer to buy the balance of Borg-Warner.
    Analysts who know GAF predict Heyman will either end up
with Borg-Warner or enrich his chemicals and building materials
company in some other way. Heyman two years ago attempted an
unsuccessful takeover of Union Carbide Corp, but GAF benefited
from that company's restructuring.
    "Borg Warner can't quibble that it's not a legitimate
offer. It seems to me the short of it is Borg Warner is kind of
between a rock and a hard place. They either have to accept a
46 dlr proposal or perhaps work a deal where it's sweetened. I
personally think the company is (worth) around 55 dlrs per
share," said Pershing analyst Richard Henderson.
    Henderson also speculated the company might attempt a
restructuring such as the one carried out by Goodyear Tire and
Rubber Co last year when it was being courted by Sir James
Goldsmith. The company bought back the financier's stock and
carried out a wider share repurchase.
    Arbitragers, however, said they do not believe Heyman is
seeking "greenmail," or the repurchase of his stock by the
company at a premium.
    Analysts noted that Heyman seems to have no problems with
financing the transaction.
    Previously associated with "junk bond" experts, Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc, GAf said it would finance its Borg-Warner
takeover with bank financing. GAF said it would make a tender
offer following a merger agreement approved by the Borg-WArner
board and conditioned on the board's recommendation of the
tender offer and merger.
    Heyman said in a letter to Borg-Warner that he expects a
merger would provide job security for Borg-Warner employees
since the two companies businesses overlap. Analysts, however,
believe Heyman would sell off assets he did not want to repay
debt from the transaction.
    GAF's stock rose 1-5/8 today, to 48-5/8.
   "I believe, obviously, if GAF takes over Borg-Warner at the
level it is proposing it would enhance GAF share values
substantially," said Oppenheimer analyst Charles Rose.
    He said at 46 dlrs per share, Heyman's average cost for the
company's stock would be 44 dlrs per share based on GAF's
current holdings.
    Rose said the Borg-Warner plastics and chemical business,
which makes thermo-plastics is the asset attracting Heyman.
Analysts said it accounts for a third of Borg's earnings.
    The plastics are used in telephone equipment, office
equipment and appliances. "Borg has half the market in the U.S.
and is the leading technical player and the leading innovator,"
Rose said. Its competitors are Dow Chemical Co <DOW> and
Monsanto Corp <MTC>, he said.
    Borg-Warner also has an automotive parts business, and a
protective systems business, which includes Wells Fargo
security guards. It also has an information services business,
and is trying to sell its financial services business.
    Borg-Warner earned 206.1 mln dlrs or 2.35 dlrs per share on
revenues of 3.62 billion dlrs in 1986. Smaller GAF, in 1986,
earned on an operating basis 80.7 mln dlrs or 2.22 dlrs per
share on sales of 753.8 mln dlrs.
    GAF's net earnings included an after tax gain of 201.4 mln
from its participation in a Union Carbide exchange offer, a
special union carbide dividend, and the sale of its Union
Carbide shares.

The U.S. Agriculture Department will
be forced to close 13 foreign posts and reduce personnel in
five others unless Congress approves two mln dlrs in
supplemental appropriations for fiscal 1987 to cover increased

senior department official said.
    Thomas Kay, administrator of USDA's Foreign Agricultural

has raised USDA's costs in many of its 75 offices overseas.
    Kay declined to say which posts were jeopardized by rising

raise the costs of running offices staffed by agricultural

projections.

spending by about 510,000 dlrs elsewhere, FAS said.

dlrs in supplemental funds to cover FAS losses. The full House
may take up the measure, folded into a government-wide
supplemental appropriations bill, next week.

Pennzoil Co Chairman J. Hugh Liedtke
told a meeting of securities analysts that the company will
consider any realistic settlement offer in its 11.0 billion dlr
ongoing litigation with Texaco Inc <TX>.
    "I wish I could tell you that I am optimistic about the
chances (of a settlement), but I am not," Liedtke said. "I
assure you, however, that we will continue to try."
    He said that Pennzoil has made a number of settlement
offers to Texaco both before the litigation commenced and
after, but the offers were repeatedly rejected. He said Texaco
has made no realistic offers.
    Earlier this year, a Texas court of appeals upheld
Pennzoil's claim against Texaco, ruling that Texaco unlawfully
interfered with Pennzoil's merger agreement with Getty Oil.
Texaco subsequently acquired Getty.
    Liedtke said it has become more difficult to settle the
case because the courts continually rule in its favor, raising
the stakes of any agreement.
    "Each time this goes up (to a higher court), the
expectations of our shareholders goes up and it puts us in an
increasingly difficult positon," he said.
    "We cannot afford to settle this case for a pittance,"
Liedtke told the meeting of analysts.
    "We don't want to get sued for not fulfilling our fiduciary
responsibilities," he said.
    Liedtke also said that the company would not settle for
less than two billion dlrs, which has been suggested by a
number of Wall Street analysts.
    He did say, however, that Pennzoil would entertain any
proposal from Texaco including a possible preferred stock
position in TExaco.
    "I won't assume we'll take it," he said. "But we'd consider
it." But he added that he thought it would be extremely
difficult to work out a settlement made up of stocks, bonds and
cash.
    Liedtke, who earlier said the company would have a lower
first quarter, also told reporters that the company expected
lower earnings this year.
    "We think earnings will probably be down this year," he
said. Last year the company earned 1.28 dlrs a share from
continuing operations or 68.5 mln dlrs on revenues of 1.9
billion dlrs.
    The earnings figure comes before an extraordinary loss of
56 cts a share or 23.1 mln dlrs.

Republican members of the House
Agriculture Committee said they will propose amendments
tomorrow to a pending trade bill increasing funding for the
export enhancement program, EEP, and significantly expanding
the scope of the program.
    At a press conference, Republican lawmakers said they would
propose expanding EEP to include all countries "willing to
purchase additional commodities at reasonable prices."
    In addition, the Congressmen said they would propose
extending the life of EEP to five years from the current three
years and increasing the EEP funding ceiling to 2.5 billion
dlrs from 1.5 billion at present.
    The Agriculture committee tomorrow will begin drafting
amendments to an omnibus trade bill now before the House.
    Responding to the Republican plan, Agriculture Secretary
Richard Lyng and Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said they
favor a flexible, targeted use of EEP instead of an
across-the-board program which they termed too costly.
    The Republican Congressmen also said they will offer an
amendment to the trade bill instructing the U.S. Agriculture
Department to value the bonus commodities used for EEP at the
market value, rather than the cost of acquisition.
    But Lyng said USDA already plans to change to market value
accounting rather than acquisition value, in order to avoid
hitting a funding ceiling for eep of 1.5 billion dlrs.
    Lyng said under market value accounting only about 700 mln
dlrs of EEP commodities have been used to date. Using
acquisition value, USDA officials said the value is higher.

Ames Department Stores Inc fell 1-7/8
to 23 in what analysts said was a reaction to a surprise
announcement earlier today by the company that earnings in the
fiscal year ended January 31 will decline sharply.
    Ames said it expects to report earnings of between 72 and
77 cts per share compared with 1.19 dlrs per share in the
previous year.
    "We were looking for 1.15 dlrs," said an analyst at a major
Wall Street firm who declined to be identified. Ames said most
of the decline resulted from an inventory shortage at its
Secaucus, N.J. distribution center.
    "The obvious suspicion is that there has been some kind of
fraud or theft," said Ralph Shulansky, senior vice president of
Ames. "We do not have hard evidence we are still putting things
together."
    He said it would take several weeks for the company to
complete an investigation. He said there are no law enforcement
officials involved at this time.
    He declined to quantify the inventory shortage but said it
was the major reason for the decline in earnings. A decline in
gross margin percentage and an increase in the effective tax
rate also contributed to the downturn, Ames said.

General Motors of Canada
Ltd, wholly owned by General Motors Corp, said it is planning a
450 mln Canadian dlr retooling and modernization of its
21-year-old Ste. Therese, Quebec, plant and has received 220
mln dlrs in interest-free government loans for the project.
    GM Canada said the Canadian and Quebec governments are each
providing a 110 mln dlr loan for the upgrading.
    The company said much of the investment will be used to
build a paint complex, which will make the plant competitive
with other GM plants in the U.S. and Canada.
    The 450-mln-dlr investment includes the cost of retooling
the plant to assemble front-wheel drive Chevrolet Celebrity
cars, which will be produced at Ste. Therese, beginning in May,
GM Canada said.
    "With the new paint complex and tooling, our plant will be
fully modernized to be world competitive," GM Canada president
George Peapples told a news conference.
    He said construction will begin this year on the modern
base coat/clear coat paint complex, which will provide enhanced
color standards and improved paint quality, he said.
    The Canadian government said the modernization will
guarantee continued long-term employment for about 3,500
assembly line workers at the Ste. Therese plant and for about
4,300 people employed in supply jobs in Ontario and Quebec.
    "Without our participation...we faced the prospect of
losing this plant," said Michel Cote, Canadian minister of
regional industrial expansion.
    Cote said he expected 3,100 new supplier jobs will be
created by the increased production in Ste. Therese.
    The project will transfer the company's front-wheel drive
"A" car production to Ste. Therese from Oshawa, Ontario and
will not increase the Ste Therese plant's capacity, GM Canada
said.
    It said it has produced 2.5 mln vehicles at the Ste.
Therese plant since 1965.
    The paint plant is expected to cost 200 to 250 mln dlrs and
begin operation in two years, Peapples told reporters after the
announcement.
    The retooling included in the project had been announced in
December but the company had not put a value on the retooling
costs, he said.
    Peapples estimated the interest-free loans could save GM
Canada about 60 mln dlrs at a 10 pct interest rate.
    He said the loans are repayable in full in 30 years if GM
keeps the plant open. If the company closes the plant in the
1990s, it will have to pay the federal and provincial
governments a total 75 mln dlrs of the loan by 1991.
    Peapples said GM Canada asked for the government loans
because, due to an expected overcapacity in the auto industry
in the 1990s, the company was not prepared to take the risks
involved in the investment by itself.
    GM Canada said the level of support offered by the
governments is consistent with aid provided to auto assemblers
in the U.S.
    Peapples said the company expects very strong demand in the
next decade for the type of mid-size, front wheel drive car
that will be produced at Ste. Therese.
    Cote added that GM Canada's 1985 sales of 18.5 billion dlrs
represented four pct of Canada's gross domestic product.

The U.S. Agriculture Department said
it has extended until April 17 the date by which Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation county offices must determine

1987 farm programs.
    Jerome Sitter, director of ASCS's Cotton, Grain and Rice

many persons would be involved in their farming operations.
    Earlier this year USDA extended the deadline to April 1

the extension was necessary because of heavy workloads at
county ASCS offices.

entities, such as corporations and partnerships, in preparation
for imposing the 50,000-dlr-per-entity cap."
    "These offices already had a very heavy workload due to the

General Motors Corp's relationship with
its hourly employees has turned ugly, and security analysts say
the discord forebodes tough talks this fall on a new national
labor contract at General Motors.
    General Motors' dealings with the United Auto Workers,
marred in recent months by strikes and a contract rejections,
shows few signs of improving as it tries to regain the lead
from Ford Motor Co <F> as the richest U.S. auto company.
    Analysts say the automaker might have to endure a major
strike this fall before the situation is resolved.
    "There is a lot of tension between the workers and GM,"
says Michael Luckey, analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers.
    Last week's four-day walkout by 9,000 UAW workers at
Pontiac, Mich., follows longer strikes at two General Motors
parts plants in the past year and rejection of proposed
contracts at other facilities.
    Analysts say the Pontiac strike will not be the last to hit
the company.
    Other plant strikes are likely, and chances are high that
the UAW will call a company-wide walkout against GM this fall,
says Luckey.
    "There is a good chance there will be a strike," says
Salomon Brothers analyst Jean-Claude Gruet.
    "GM is acting as if they would welcome a strike," said Ron
Glantz, analyst with Montgomery Securities.
    "It has been my experience the UAW strikes people they
don't like. They don't like GM," says Glantz.
    General Motors might also be faced with wildcat strikes, or
walkouts by local union units that are not endorsed by the
union's central committee, analysts said.
    General Motors will not comment on the talks, saying only
it is seeking to become a "world-class competitor."
    Elements for a tough set of labor talks are in place.
"There is a lot of pressure on both sides. (General Motors
chairman Roger) Smith is under pressure from stockholders. The
union is fighting to protect its members. Something has got to
give," Luckey says.
    The consensus on Wall Street is that General Motors will be
chosen as the "strike target", or the main company with which
it will negotiate in the fall talks to decide the next
three-year national contract.
    "You get a feeling from talking with GM that they want to
be the strike target because (they feel) Ford might capitulate
too easily," says Glantz.
    The negotiations, expected to begin in late July, will
decide the major wage, benefit and job security issues that
will cover most U.S. autoworkers. The current contract expires
September 15.
    Job security and "outsourcing", the  subcontracting of jobs
to non-UAW labor, are expected to be the main issues.
    "You're going to see a rough set of negotiations,
particularly if they can't get the outsourcing issue decided,"
says one former General Motors human relations executive.
    Some analysts point out that if the UAW decides to focus on
wages, it might pick Ford as the strike target because of
Ford's higher earnings last year.
    "You may see a situation where the UAW bargains with the
two separately," breaking its historical pattern, says Luckey.
    The number of cars building up in dealer showrooms might
indicate General Motors is preparing for a confrontation with
the union, analysts say.
    The company will have 95 days' supply of cars in dealer
showrooms at the end of March, Lucky estimates. Analysts say 50
to 65-days' supply is normal.
   General Motors wants to enter the negotiations "with enough
inventory that it won't feel a six-week strike," says Glantz.
    Some in the industry say that, despite the closing of 11
plants and indefinite layoff of 37,000 workers, further
closings and layoffs might be coming.
    A General Motors spokesman says it is "too early" to know
whether plant closures will become an issue in the talks.
    The former General Motors executive says more closures are
likely after a new UAW agreement is reached, but he adds,
"you're not going to see it before the contract," he says.
    Lucky says 10 pct of General Motors's components plants are
on the "red list" of companies likely to be shut. "It would
take a miracle for them to survive," he says.

    In a statement in the Congressional Record, the Wisconsin
Democrat said that as of March 19, 50 banks had failed. "At
that pace, some 200 banks will go bankrupt before the year is
out," he said, compared to 144 last year--worst since the
depression.
    Despite the statistics, he said, "American banking today
remains overall remarkably safe and prudent."

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
proposed for comment a rule setting minimum capital
requirements for banks based on assessment of the risks of
their assets.
    The proposed rule, if adopted, would carry out a
U.S.-British agreement announced in January for a uniform
system to gauge the capital banks must maintain that accounts
for the riskiness of loans and other assets.
    The regulatory agency's staff said at a meeting the
proposal was in line with those of the Federal Reserve Board
and the Comptroller of the Currency.
    The three U.S. agencies and the Bank of England agreed in
early January on the outlines of a uniform system for capital
standards designed for the increasingly international banking
industry that operates beyond national boundaries.
    The FDIC, which regulates state-chartered banks, sought
public comment for 60 days, after which it will adopt a rule to
conform with those of the Fed and the Comptroller.
    The FDIC said the proposal rule redefines primary capital,
assigns risk weights to assets not kept on a bank's balance
sheet, and lays the groundwork for establishing a minimum
risk-based capital ratio.

that began in July 1982.
    Consumers Power said the settlement will cause it to take a
one-time loss of six mln dlrs, or seven cts a share, in its
first quarter.
    The impact will be less than the payment to Union Carbide
because Consumers Power set up a reserve to account for the
settlement, the tax effect of the settlement, and "some

    Union Carbide had sought 162.5 mln dlrs in damages from

Carbide. In 1982 Consumers Power stopped taking oil under the
contract, claiming it was excused from buying more oil under
certain provisions of the accord.

Dome Petroleum Ltd, earlier
reporting a 2.20 billion dlr 1986 loss compared to year-earlier
profit of 7.0 mln dlrs, said the loss was mainly due to write
downs totalling 2.084 billion dlrs before a reduction in
deferred income taxes of 571 mln dlrs.
    The loss also includes 214 mln dlrs in accumulated foreign
exchange losses, the company said.
    "The dramatic drop in energy prices in early 1986 reverses
much of the progress the company has made in the two previous
years," Dome chairman J. Howard Macdonald said in a statement.
    "But even a net loss of this magnitude has very little
bearing on the day-to-day operations of Dome," chairman
Macdonald said.
    "It merely reflects the realistic carrying value of the
company's assets in today's economic environment, and the
absolute need for reaching a timely agreement with our lenders
on a debt restructuring plan to assure the company's continued
existence," he added.
    Dome is now trying to reach agreement on a complex plan for
restructuring debt of more than 6.10 billion dlrs.
    Dome said it charged the 214 mln dlrs in accumulated
foreign exchange losses to current expenses because of the
uncertainty arising from its proposed restructuring plan.
    Normally the expenses would be amortized over the remaining
period of the loans to which they apply, it said.
    Dome also said the write downs included a fourth quarter
reduction in the value of its oil and gas properties of 1.20
billion dlrs, before a reduction in deferred income taxes of
305 mln dlrs. The fourth quarter writedown was in addition to a
charge of 880 mln dlrs on certain other assets, taken mainly in
the third quarter.
    Dome said the 1.20 billion dlr fourth quarter charge
resulted from a year-end accounting change made under new full
cost accounting guidelines by the Canadian Institute of
Chartered Accountants.
    The company said it previously determined a write down of
conventional oil and gas properties was not required at
September 30, under the previous method of calculating the
limitation of oil and gas values.
    Dome said the most significant accounting change under the
new guidelines is using current oil and gas prices in
calculations instead of escalating price forecasts.
    Terms of Dome's proposed debt restructuring plan preclude
the company from making an accurate estimate of future
financing costs, which are used in the new accounting
calculations, it said.
    As a result, Dome adopted current prices and costs and a 10
pct discount factor in the calculations, which substantially
conform with accounting rules prescribed by the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission, the company said.
    Dome said operating income from its crude oil and natural
gas segments fell by 2.50 billion dlrs to a 1986 loss of 1.71
billion dlrs from prior year earnings of 737.0 mln dlrs.
    Dome said the steep drop in crude oil and natural gas
operating income was due to write downs totalling 1.93 billion
dlrs and lower energy prices that sharply reduced revenue.
    Reduced production of natural gas and lower utilization of
Dome's offshore drilling fleet in the Beaufort Sea also
contributed to the decline, it said.
    Earnings from its natural gas liquids business fell by 79
pct to 42.0 mln dlrs from 199 mln dlrs in 1985.
    Cash from operations dropped to 5.0 mln dlrs from year-ago
542.0 mln dlrs and unrestricted cash balance declined to 202.0
mln dlrs from 466.0 mln dlrs.
    Dome said 1986 crude oil production in 1986 was maintained
at prior year's levels through new drilling activity and
improvements in productivity.
    Natural gas production fell by nine pct as a result of
lower domestic and export sales, it said.
    Oil and field natural gas liquids production totalled
86,000 barrels a day, compared to 87,000 bpd in the prior year.
    Natural gas production fell to 536.0 mln cubic feet a day
from 591.0 mcf a day.

Pacific Gas and Electric Co said
it expects to record a 470 mln dlr, or 1.25 dlr per share,
reduction in 1987 earnings because of the company's decision to
change the method used to record Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power
Plant revenues.
    The accounting change will not affect the company's cash
position and the company intends to continue paying its
dividend at the annual rate of 1.92 dlrs per share.
    Last year Pacific Gas reported earnings of 925 mln dlrs, or
2.60 dlrs per share.
    Pacific Gas said the accounting change was prompted by
delays in the receipt of a California Public Utilities
Commission decision on the company's 1984 application for rate
relief to recover the 5.8 billion dlr cost of constructing
units one and two of the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Project.
    It said the commission is currently allowing the company to
recover 40 pct of the cost of owning and operating the plants.
    As a result, 63 mln dlrs has been accumulating each month
as deferred non-cash account receivable, which has been
included in current income.
    But the accounting change, effective January 1, will
reflect only cash received through interim rates approved by
the commission, Pacific Gas and Electric said.
    It also said the commission is now awaiting its Public
Staff Division's report which will recommend how much of the
5.8 billion dlr investment Pacific Gas should be allowed to
recover in rates.
    The company further stated that it is confident it will
receive an objective review of the facts.
    It also said it intends to seek additional interim rates.
    Pacific Gas began construction of the two nuclear power
units in 1969. After a number of construction delays, unit one
went into operation in May 1985 and unit two went on line in
March last year.

The surge in currency futures since
Friday on the heels of the Reagan administration's proposed
tariffs on Japanese imports is likely to be curtailed in the
coming week, financial analysts said.
    "The market is taking a breather now, and I would expect it
to last a little longer," said Craig Sloane, a currency analyst
with Smith Barney, Harris, Upham and Co.
    Profit-taking, which robbed the currency futures of some
momentum today, is likely to continue, he said.
    Central banks are likely to play a role in halting the
advance in currencies through intervention, the analysts said,
even though the dollar fell to a 40-year low against the
Japanese yen on Monday despite Bank of Japan intervention.
    Treasury Secretary James Baker's comments that the G-6
nations remain committed to the Paris accord, coupled with his
refusal to give any targets for exchange rates, provided a note
of stability to the market Tuesday, the analysts said.
    Furthermore, Merrill Lynch Economics analyst David Horner
said G-6 central banks haven't yet shown the full force of
their commitment to the Paris accord.
    "I'm among those who believe the G-6 have a plan behind the
scenes," Horner said.
    Horner said more forceful central bank intervention will
firm the dollar and cap the rise in currency futures.
    "Coordinated, punishing intervention" by the central banks
-- in contrast to the recent rolling intervention which has
only smoothed out the market -- is in the offing, according to
Horner.
    "I think we're near the top of the range in the Europeans
(currencies)," he said.
     On the other hand, the upside target for the yen, which
set a new contract high today at 0.006916 in the June contract,
is at 0.007050, Horner said.
    Still, other analysts believe currency futures have yet to
peak.
    "The basic trend in the currencies is higher," said Anne
Parker Mills, currency analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers
Inc. "The market wants to take the dollar lower."
    Uncertainty over central bank action and nervousness over a
G-5 meeting next week in advance of a meeting of the
International Monetary Fund could make for choppy price
activity the remainder of the week, Mills said.
    In addition, although the market shrugged off relatively
healthy gains in February U.S. leading economic indicators and
factory orders Tuesday, economic data could play a larger role
in coming sessions, the analysts said.
    Friday's employment statistics in particular will be
closely watched, Sloane said, adding that a forecast rise of
250,000 in non-farm payroll jobs should underpin the dollar.

The U.S. grain planting intentions and
stocks reports bear optimistic news for U.S agriculture, a
grain analyst on a Chicago Board of Trade panel said.
    The decline in intended soybean acreage and lower stocks
are "the first report we've had for a long time that shows any
optimism for anybody," said John "Bud" Frazier, grain analyst
and executive vice president for Balfour MacLaine, Inc.
    "I'm really excited about it," Frazier said.
    The U.S. Department of Agriculture said farmers intend to
plant 67.6 mln acres of corn, down from 76.7 mln planted last
year, and 56.8 mln acres of soybeans, down from 61.5 mln.
    The report showed March 1 stocks of 1.4 billion bushels of
soybeans, 8.3 billion bushels of corn, and 2.3 billion bushels
of wheat, all below trade guesses.
    Frazier was joined by Susan Hackmann, senior grain analyst
with AgriAnalysis, and Mark Meyer, a grain analyst with
Shearson Lehman Brothers, Inc., on a Chicago Board of Trade
panel to discuss the reports.
    Frazier said the stocks reports in particular were friendly
for the market, and soybean prices would jump three to five
cents a bushel "if the bell rang right now."
    "We're getting our disappearance up. We have less (corn and
soybeans) than we thought we had," he said, noting that hog and
poultry production is up.
    "We're seeing low prices generate some interest in demand,"
said Meyer, adding that feed use was up 13 pct last quarter and
15 pct in the preceding quarter.
    However, Hackmann said production could continue to exceed
consumption.
    She noted that most of the reductions in soybean acres came
in southeastern states, where yields are usually low.
    "We have the potential for record breaking soybean yields
this year, (which) will temper the enthusiasm on tomorrow's
opening," she said.
    Hackmann said record corn yields also are possible, and the
crop could reach 7.1 billion bushels, which would be down from
last year's 8.25 billion bushels.
    "We'll need very good disappearance next year to reduce
stocks," she said. The USDA estimated disappearance last year
at 6.7 billion bushels.
    Hackmann said the stocks report was positive for the long
term, "But we still have a long way to go to bring stocks down
to where we could start rebuilding prices."
    Frazier also cautioned that the soybean acreage report
could prompt farmers to change their plans and plant more
soybeans.
    The panelists agreed that the reports should discourage
talk of revising the 1985 farm bill.
    "There seems to be no desire ... to change the farm law
we're working under today, and this report should reinforce
that," Frazier said.
    "We are seeing the program beginning to work," said Meyer.

Quarter-point prime rate increases to
7-3/4 pct by Citibank and Chase Manhattan Bank today will be
followed by other banks only after they see clearer signs of
the Federal Reserve's policy intentions, economists said.
    "Based on the spread between banks' cost of funds and the
prime rate, it probably makes sense for others to follow, but
no rush is likely," said Paul McCulley of E.F. Hutton and Co.
    Citibank's surprise base rate increase, quickly followed by
Chase, sent U.S. bond prices lower and the dollar higher.
    McCulley said that once the spread between three-month
certificates of deposit and the prime rate narrows to less than
1-1/2 percentage points, there is a strong chance of a prime
rate increase. It has been under 1-1/4 points recently.
    However, banks are likely to hold rate increases until they
see what the Fed intends to do about interest rates in the near
term, analysts said. They noted that banks historically like to
follow Fed rate movements, rather than lead them. For example,
the last prime rate increase occurred in June 1984 when banks
lifted the rate to 13 pct from 12-1/2 pct after a Fed discount
rate increase in April of that year.
    Major banks had been posting a 7-1/2 pct prime rate since
last August 26/27, when they lowered the rate from eight pct
shortly after the Fed's half-point discount rate cut to the
current 5-1/2 pct level on August 20.
    "The banks will not rush to raise their prime rates. There
should be a split prime for a while with some posting a 7-1/2
pct rate and others 7-3/4 pct," said David Jones of Aubrey G.
Lanston and Co.
    Jones said the Federal Open Market Committee at today's
meeting voted no change in Fed policy. But he said the Fed may
well foster higher interest rates soon.
    Jones said that, while the FOMC probably voted no policy
change today, it may have decided to apply slight upward rate
pressure later if the dollar weakens, inflation pressures heat
up or the economy shows sign of strong recovery.
    "The Fed clearly indicated that they did not intend to
tighten policy when they did today's coupon pass," said Joseph
Liro of S.G. Warburg and Co.
    In a move that came a day earlier than most expected, the
Fed today supplied permanent reserves to the banking system by
offering to buy all maturities of Treasury notes and bonds for
its own account. This seasonal reserve add is called a "pass."
    "The Fed demonstrated that there has been no policy
change," said Elizabeth Reiners, economist at Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc. 
    She said the spread between banks' cost of funds and the
prime rate is now around 137 basis points compared with a 153
basis point average in 1986. Reiners said the spread is not
really narrow enough to present a clear need for a prime rate
increase.
    The Dean Witter economist said that today's prime rate rise
"may have been less a response to interest rates than an
attempt to enhance the (balance sheet) bottom line."
    Reiners said that, given recent problems with loans to
developing countries, large money center banks with heavy
exposures might be the first to match the higher prime rate in
an effort to get more profitable spreads on other loans.
    The Federal funds rate at which banks lend overnight money
to one another could help determine how many banks match the
higher prime rate and also how quickly they move.
    In raising their prime rates, banks cited a higher cost of
funds. In the three business days through Monday, the Federal
funds rate at which banks lend to one another averaged nearly
6-1/4 pct. But quarter end pressures helped push up funds.  
    The Fed funds rate was extremely volatile today, reflecting
demand pressure associated with the end of the quarter and the
close of the Japanese fiscal year. Funds traded between five
and 6-3/4 pct.
    Once the special distortions end, analysts said the funds
rate probably will return to its recent trading level in the
6-1/8 pct area. They said that, if it stabilizes near there,
banks may not quickly boost their prime rates.
    But a consistently higher funds rates would suggest to many
that the Fed was fostering somewhat higher interest rates to
help the dollar. Then banks would lift prime rates quickly.

First City Bancorp of Texas, which lost
a record 402 mln dlrs in 1986, said in its annual report it
expected operating losses to continue "for the foreseeable
future" as it continues to search for additional capital or a
merger partner.
    The Houston-based bank's 1986 financial statements received
a qualified opinion from its auditors, Arthur Andersen and Co.
The auditors said their opinion was subject to First City
eventually obtaining additional capital.
    "The company believes that in order to address its
long-term needs and return to a satisfactory level of
operations, it will ultimately need several hundred million
dollars of additional capital, or a combination with a more
strongly capitalized entity," First City said in a note to its
financial statements included in the annual report.
    "Management believes that sufficient resources should be
available to cover interim capital concerns while additional
capital is being sought," the bank said.
    To raise cash in the near-term, First City said it may sell
or mortgage non-strategic assets, recover excess contributions
to its pension plan and obtain special dividends from some of
its member banks.
    "The losses for 1987 are expected to be substantially less
than in 1986," First City chairman J.A. Elkins said in a letter
included in the annual report. "However, the ultimate return to
satisfactory operating conditions is dependent on the
successful resolution of the related problems of credit
quality, funding and the eventual need for substantial
additional capital."
    First City said it anticipated that certain covenants of a
credit agreement with unaffiliated banks requiring most of
First City's excess cash to be applied to debt repayments would
be modified by the end of the first quarter in order to avoid
default.
    The banks agreed to similar amendments to the covenants
last year and First City has reduced its borrowings from 120
mln dlrs at 1986 yearend to 68.5 mln dlrs in recent weeks.
    Although the parent company's capital adequacy ratios
exceeded regulatory minimum requirements at the end of 1986,
First City said its two largest subsidiaries did not. First
City National Bank of Houston had a primary capital ratio of
5.34 pct and First City Bank of Dallas had a 4.75 pct ratio.
    Hard-hit by the collapse in oil and Texas real estate
prices, First City's net loan chargeoffs totaled 366 mln dlrs
last year, up from 261 mln dlrs in 1985. The bank more than
doubled its loan loss provision to 497 mln dlrs at the end of
1986.
    First City said chargeoffs and paydowns reduced its total
energy loan portfolio by 32 pct during 1986, to 1.4 billion
dlrs at year-end, adding that future energy chargeoffs "should
be more modest." The amount represented 15 pct of First City's
total loans.
    In real estate, First City said its nonperforming assets
nearly doubled last year to 347 mln dlrs at year-end.
Chargeoffs of real estate loans rose to 32 mln dlrs, or nine
pct of total loan chargeoffs, and the bank said the amount
could go higher.
    "The company still faces uncertainties in the real estate
market and anticipates further deterioration in the pportfolio
so long as the regional recession persists," First City said.
"Because the carrying value of many of these loans is
collateral dependent, a further decline in the overall value of
the collateral base could cause an increase in the level of
real estate-related chargeoffs."

The complex task of wielding control
over monetary policy in an increasingly fast-moving global
economy could be aided by tying policy to commodity prices, the
newest member of the Federal Reserve Board says.
    Commodity prices are already considered by the Fed in the
making of monetary policy. But they would be given a much
greater role under an idea being floated by Governor Robert
Heller, who joined the board last August.
    He conceeds that much more study of the idea is needed, but
argues that such an arrangement, particularly if it were
adopted by other major industrial countries, could reduce the
volatility of exchange rates.
    Moreover, it could help stabilize of the prices of
commodities themselves, slowing changes in inflation.
    His idea, which many conservative economists find
appealing, has some backing among board members appointed in
recent years by President Reagan.
    It would complement the present system of opening or
closing the monetary screws based on the pattern of inflation,
key indicators such as unemployment, and the rise or fall of
the money supply. Changes in the money supply can lead to
changes in interest rates and affect economic activity
directly.
    Discussed on and off for a long time, the commodity concept
is part of a growing search for a system that anchors monetary
policy and widely-fluxtuating currency prices to a more solid
base.
    "What is needed is an anchor or reference point that can
serve as a guide for both domestic and international monetary
purposes," says Heller.
    In the past, this anchor was gold but the United States
went off the gold standard because the global economy had
vastly outstripped gold supplies.
    A return to the gold standard is generally dismissed out of
hand by most policymakers on the grounds that the largest
producers of gold are the Soviet Union and South Africa.
    The so-called fixed rate system, scuttled in the early
1970s, is still considered unworkable in the present world.
    But the current system of floating currencies in which
currencies can fluxtuate widely, adding vast pressures to the
monetary system, is also being widely questioned.
    Some have suggested that the system might benefit from a
formal approach that mandates intervention by countries when
currencies wander above or below agreed to levels but there are
major problems with this also.
    For one thing, there is justifiable concern that countries
might be relunctant to intervene if they felt it might be
detrimental to their own domestic economy.
    Moreover, some question whether concerted intervention can
make much of an inpact if the overall market does not agree
with the fundamental judgement.
    The poorest countries have called for a monetary conference
to work out a new system that, not surprisingly, helps them
cope with their overpowering debt problems.
    Treasury Secretary James Baker, the Reagan administration's
chief economic architect, has preferred to use the so-called
Group of Five industrial countries or sometimes, Seven, as a
forum to work out cooperative agreements on currency and other
economic matters.
   He appears convinced that officials from West Germany,
France, Britain, Japan, Italy and Canada talking quietly behind
closed doors can reached reasoned decisions away from public
posturing.
   The Heller approach, while extremely complex, could have a
profound impact on the system, ideally stabalizing prices and
international exchange rates.
    As envisioned by Heller, a basket of say, 30 major
commodities ranging from wheat to oil, would be put together
and prices would be measured on a regular basis.
    "In times of rising commodity prices, monetary policy might
be tightened and in times of falling commodity prices, montary
policy might be eased," he says.
    He notes that commodity prices are traded daily in auction
markets, and a commodity price index can be calculated on a
virtually continuous basis.
    Moreover, most commodity prices are produced, consumed and
traded on a world-wide basis, so "that an index has a relevance
for the entire world," he says.
    In addition, commodity prices are at the beginning of the
production chain and serve as an imput into virtually all
production processes.
    "Focusing on commodity prices as an early and sensitive
indicator of current and perhaps also future prices pressures,
the monetary authorities may take such an index into account in
making their monetary policy decisions," he says.
    However, he says that any major change in a basic commodity
such as occurred in oil during the 1970s because of action by
the OPEC cartel, would have to be discounted in such a system.
    He says the worst thing that could happen is to allow
monetary policy to spread a freakish increase in one commodity
to the rest of the system and to other commodities.

Emery Air Freight Corp said it
plans to begin tomorrow a 40 dlr a share tender offer for 83
pct of the outstanding common stock of Purolator Courier Corp.
    The company said the tender offer is the first step in a
plan to buy 100 pct of the Purolator shares.
    Following the tender offer, Emery said it would offer 40
dlrs of junior subordinated debentures for each remaining
Purolator share outstanding.
    On March one, Purolator agreed to a 35 dlr a share
leveraged buyout by eight Purolator executives and EF Hutton
LBO Inc, a unit of EF Hutton Group Inc.
    Emery said it had tried unsuccessfully to open merger
discussions with Purolator before the company accepted the
management-led buyout offer.
    In a letter to Purolator's chairman, Nicholas F. Brady,
Emery's chairman, John C. Emery, said the company would still
prefer to negotiate with Purolator.
    But he said the imminent expiration of the leveraged buyout
group's offer has forced the company to make an unsolicited
tender offer of its own.
    Emery said its offer is scheduled to expire at 2400 EST on
April 28, unless extended.
    The company said conditions of the offer include the
receipt of at least two-thirds of Purolator's shares
outstanding, on a fully diluted basis, and the repeal of its
share purchase rights plan.
    Emery said the offer is also subject to completion of the
previously announced sale of Purolator's Canadian operations.
    Emery said Chemical Bank, Bankers Trust, Morgan Guaranty
Trust Co and Salomon Bros had agreed to provide financing for
the tender offer.
    It said the junior subordinated debentures to be issued in
the subsequent merger will carry a 13 pct annual interest rate,
payable twice a year.
    For the first three years after the notes are issued,
interest will be paid, at Emery's option, in cash or in
additional notes, Emery said.
    It added that the notes will not be subject to redemption
for one year after they are issued.
    Emery said Purolator would operate as a wholly owned unit
of the company after the merger. It said it hoped Purolator's
management would continue with the company.
    "We believe that our two companies provide an excellent fit
with each other and that the combination will enable each of us
to better serve our existing customers and meet the challenges
of the future," Emery's chairman said in his letter.
    He said a merger would significantly enhance the financial
turnaround that Purolator's management had previously forecast.
    Officials at Purolator could not immediately be reached for
comment on the offer, which was released several hours after
the stock market had closed.
    Emery's stock closed up 1/2 at 12-5/8.
    Purolator closed at 34-7/8, off 5/8.

Commerzbank AG <CBKG.F> management
board chairman Walter Seipp said that from the present
viewpoint the bank must expect 1987 full operating profit to be
lower than in 1986.
    In the first two months of the year, partial operating
profit -- excluding trading on the bank's own account -
declined, he said, without giving details.
    The interest surplus fell 2.8 pct compared with 2/12ths of
1986 results, while the commission surplus, because of the
quiet stock exchange business, fell back still more strongly.
By contrast the personnel and fixed asset expenses increased.
    German banks do not report full operating profit. But Seipp
said last year the figure for the first time had topped one
billion marks for the parent bank, and the group result was
around 50 pct higher than this.
    Commenting on 1986, Seipp said, "we were able to raise the
full operating profit...Slightly above the record result of
1985 because own account profits increased slightly."
    He gave no concrete details but added that in January and
February, good own account trading profits meant that the drop
in full operating earnings was more modest than that in the
partial operating figure.
    The bank would, as a result, be more profit-oriented in
future, developing, for example, more into investment banking,
keeping a tight rein on personnel costs and dampening
expenditures on fixed assets.
    Turning to 1986 results, Seipp said by year end there had
been a strong growth in business volume.
    Over the year business volume rose by 9.9 pct to 93.2
billion marks compared with 1985, Seipp added.
    Group balance sheet volume rose by 8.0 pct to 148.15
billion. It would have been around five billion marks higher
still if currency relationships had remained unchanged.
    In the parent bank, the interest surplus rose nine pct in
the year, while the interest margin held roughly at 1985's 2.56
pct despite pressure on credit rates.
    The surplus on commission business, which had soared by a
quarter in 1985, rose by 11.6 pct last year thanks almost
exclusively to growth in securities commissions, Seipp said.
    Personnel expenditure was up 11.9 pct last year, at more
than 1.5 billion marks. Fixed asset expenditure rose by 9.6 pct
to more than 650 mln.
    As a result, the parent bank partial operating profit rose
by 3.2 pct to 752 mln marks.
    Parent bank tax payment rose to 244 mln marks last year
from 233 mln in 1985.
    Seipp said extraordinary earnings included a "high
two-figure million" in profit from the sale of the bank's AEG AG
<AEGG.F> shares to Daimler-Benz AG <DAIG.F> during the latter's
majority stake purchase booked last year.
    The ability of the bank to write off depreciations in
credit business against profits from securities trading and
earnings on the sale of stakes had been utilised, as in prior
years, to its full extent.
    Because of numerous insolvencies at home, by far the
largest part of the provisions were set aside for individual
write-downs from domestic business. Abroad, the circle of
problem debtor countries rose last year, although the ratio of
credit exposure to provisions improved further.
    Seipp said that because about half the group's exposure to
problem nations was in dollars, the bank had swapped into
dollars individual provisions hitherto held primarily in marks.
    "This means that no open currency positions exist any longer
on the amount of the provision that is made against an actual
default," he added.
    Despite the increase in concern over debtor nations in the
last few weeks, he said, the international banking community is
better armed than it was against payment problems.
    All banks had significantly strengthened their capital
base, most European banks had made considerable provisions
against bad debts while goverments and central banks were
better prepared for unforseen difficulties.
    He described debt-equity swaps as a very interesting new
approach to indebted nations' problems. There was a lot of
interest in direct investment via an equity participation in
Latin America, particularly from West German firms.

The Bundesbank should take further
steps to reduce German interest rates to protect the mark from
further appreciation and to persuade investors to bring
long-term yields lower, Commerzbank AG <CBKG.F> management
board chairman Walter Seipp said.
    But he told the bank's annual news conference this did not
mean a cut in leading interest rates, rather a reduction in
money market rates through bringing the allocation rates down
for Bundesbank securities repurchase agreements.
    "Leading interest rates are not the decisive rates," he said.
"The money market rates are the important ones."
    Seipp said the Bundesbank should move away from allocating
money market liquidity at a fixed 3.8 pct as it has in recent
tender allocations.
    An easier monetary policy would not mean a loss of
credibility for the Bundesbank in its containment of monetary
growth. A fall in short rates would make the public aware of
the high yields in bonds and lead to a longer-term capital
formation, braking the expansion of money supply.
    "Thus, you can have lower rates and also a normalisation of
monetary growth both at the same time," he added.
    Seipp said there were no grounds to paint too black a
picture of the German economy, since company profitability had
improved over recent years and domestic oriented firms were
profiting from cheaper imports because of the rise in the mark.
    Growth this year should be at least one pct, he said,
describing the downturn in production in the first months as a
false start, unrepresentative of the rest of the year.
    After an economic contraction in the first quarter, the
economy should show an uptrend in the last three. "We don't
believe that the economy has tipped over, but see it more as a
'growth dip,'" Seipp said.
    But Seipp also called for support for growth from fiscal
policy, saying the top rate of income and corporate tax should
be brought down to 49 pct. The current peak rate is 56 pct.
    The additional tax cuts brought forward to next January
were no substitute for support for growth.
    Seipp added the federal government should make "further
courageous steps to decrease the state's proportion of the
German economy and to increase its flexibility."

Commerzbank AG <CBKG.F> management
board chairman Walter Seipp said he hoped the bank would this
year found a 100 pct investment bank subsidiary in New York.
    He told the annual news conference that the move would be
an important and necessary widening of business activities in
the U.S.. This is now mainly represented by a 40 pct stake in
EuroPartners Securities Corp, New York, owned along with other
European banks in a consortium.
    It would also be a further step in Commerzbank's full entry
into global investment banking around the clock.
    Seipp also said securities trading activities had been
considerably strengthened in London. The founding of Commerz
Securities (Japan) Co. Ltd, which would begin business in the
first half of 1987, widened the bank's activity in Tokyo.
    In 1987 also, Commerzbank planned to open a representative
office in Istanbul. Currency trading had begun in the Los
Angeles branch, he added.
    At home, Commerzbank would probably bring the automotive
supply group Boge and clothing manufacturer Ahlers to a stock
exchange flotation in the first half of this year.
    But the placement of shares in the print communications
technology group <Linotype GmbH>, to be bought from Allied
Signal Inc <ALD.N> would likely come later since several parts
of the business had to be consolidated first.
    Seipp said the purchase price had been "several hundred

Call money rates fell to 3.85/95 pct
from five pct yesterday in moderate trading as month end
tightness disappeared and operators took positions for April.
    Dealers said they expected rates to remain within a 3.70 to
four pct range this month. A minor tax payment period on behalf
of customers mid-month, the long Easter weekend and pension
payments were unlikely to tighten rates significantly.
    Next Wednesday, 14.9 billion marks are leaving the system
on the expiry of a securities repurchase pact. But dealers said
they expected the Bundesbank to fully replace the outflow with
a new tender at a fixed rate of 3.80 pct.
    Commerzbank AG's management board chairman Walter Seipp
called on the Bundesbank to reduce interest rates to protect
the mark through bringing the allocation rate for securities
repurchase agreements down.
    But dealers said the Bundesbank was unlikely to ease credit
policies at the moment. There was little domestic and foreign
pressure for lower rates and no signs of a change.
    Yesterday one or two large West German banks effectively
drained the domestic money market of liquidity in order to
achieve higher rates from their overnight deposits, dealers
said.
    Bundesbank figures showed banks held an average daily 50.7
billion marks in minimum reserves at the central bank over the
first 30 days of March, the exact requirement needed just one
day before the end of the month.
    Actual holdings on Monday were 42.0 billion marks.
    Because rates soared to the level of the Lombard emergency
funding rate yesterday, banks fell back on the loan facility to
draw down a high 5.3 billion marks in an attempt to meet
Bundesbank needs, the data showed.

The prospect that other banks will
follow industry leaders Citibank and Chase Manhattan in raising
their prime rate is likely to cast a pall over the credit
markets today, economists said.
    Bond prices had been making a smart recovery from two days
of heavy selling when Citibank surprised the market by
announcing a quarter-point increase in its prime rate to 7-3/4
pct. Chase Manhattan quickly followed.
    Prices quickly fell by a full point, even though the dollar
- the market's overriding concern of late - rose sharply on the
news.
    Citibank cited the higher cost of money, especially in the
Euromarket, as the reason for raising its prime rate.
    Part of this rise in market rates has been caused by fears
of a tighter Federal Reserve policy to defend the dollar, but
economists said it is too early to tell whether the Fed, whose
policy-making federal open market committee, FOMC, meets this
week, is already tightening its grip on credit.
    "The Fed seems to have been a bit slow in meeting the
banking system's reserve needs this statement period, but I
wouldn't conclude anything until I've seen the Fed data," said
Jeffrey Leeds of Chemical Bank.

U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor early this morning lifted an Appeals Court injunction
blocking the planned merger of Delta <DAL> Airlines
Inc and Western Airlines <WAL>, the Court said.
    O'Connor's action came hours after a three-judge panel of
the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco had
blocked the merger until a dispute over union representation
had been settled by arbitration.
    A Supreme Court spokesman said O'Connor granted a stay of
the injuction, allowing the merger, worth nearly 860 mln dlrs,
to go through as planned later today.
    The Supreme Court spokesman provided no other details. Each
of the nine Supreme Court justices has jurisdiction over a
particular regional Appellate circuit and has the power to
provisionally overturn its rulings without comment.
    The Appeals Court ruling surprised officials of
Atlanta-based Delta, which had been preparing for the merger
for months and had already painted Delta logos on airplanes
belonging to Western, which has headquartera in Los Angeles.
    "Our plans were to finalize the merger at midnight tonight,"
Delta spokesman Bill Berry told the Atlanta Constitution late
last night. "There was really very little that remained to be
done."
    The ruling in San Francisco came in a lawsuit that had been
filed in a Los Angeles federal court in which the Air Transport
Employees union sought to force Western's management to fulfill
a promise that it would honor union contracts if a merger took
place.
    The airlines argued that Western's promise could not be
enforced in a takeover by a larger company.
    After learning of the appeals court ruling, Delta officials
last night spread the word by telephone that Western employees
should report for work today in their old uniforms, not in new
Delta outfits.
    Delta announced last September that it was purchasing
Western. The merger took place in December, and Western has
been operated as a Delta subsidiary since then. The Western
name was to have disappeared at midnight last night.
    At issue is whether the Western unions would continue to
represent Western employees after the integration of the two
airlines.
    While all but eight pct of Western's 11,000 employees are
unionized, only Delta's pilots are union members.
    Delta had maintained that the three unions having contracts
with Western -- The Association of Flight Attendants and the
Teamsters, as well as the Air Transport Employees -- would be
"extinguished" after today.

The restructured London Stock Exchange
has proved itself an unqualified success in less than
six months of operation, according to exchange chairman Sir
Nicholas Goodison.
    More than 95 pct of the business has left the trading floor
and is now conducted in the offices of member firms, Goodison
said in remarks prepared for delivery in New York.
    "Competitive bids and offers can now be seen on screens all
over the country and business done is displayed on those same
screens," he said, reaching more investors than before.
    Goodison said the new system has helped investors by
promoting greater competition that in turn has led to reduced
commissions and spread.
    He said the exchange is now working on a small order
automated execution system and a system to transfer securities
without certificates.
    New laws to be enacted in full later this year will help
the Securities and Investments Board investigate suspected
abuses and punish wrongdoing, Goodison said. He believes it is
a misconception to say that the U.K. system of self-regulation
is not as good as the U.S. system.
    He noted that any violations of the rules are a criminal
offense. "There is no fifth amendment plea to offer a U.K.
inspector hot on the trial of an insider dealer," Goodison
said, in a reference to the U.S. legal system which allows
individuals to remain silent on the grounds that they may
incriminate themselves.
    Goodison said a major goal of the London exchange is to
persuade multinational corporations to seek a listing in
London. He said about 200 U.S. companies are now listed in
London, enhancing their ability to raise capital.

The USDA quarterly hogs and pig report
yesterday showed more hogs on U.S. farms compared to last year
as profitability resulting from low grain prices encouraged
producers to step up production, analysts said.
    Most analysts seemed to agree with Chicago Mercantile
Exchange floor traders that the report will be viewed as
bearish to pork futures and futures prices may open sharply
lower today. Some traders and analysts expect limit declines in
nearby contracts, with spillover selling likely in cattle.
    University of Missouri agronomist Glen Grimes said,"The
report shows that hog producers have responded to a very
desirable feeding ratio that they enjoyed for the past 10
months."
    Shearson Lehman analyst Chuck Levitt said hog futures
prices are above producers' break even points. Even if futures
fell the daily limit of 1.50 cents today, producers could still
lock in a profit, which increases the likelihood of heavy
selling pressure today.
    "We have not had a period of profitability of this
magnitude since last summer," Levitt said. "In fact, hog
operations on many mixed livestock/grain enterprises have been
so profitable that it actually enabled some farmers to get back
on their feet and refinance their loans just based on the hog
operation alone."
    Levitt said the weight breakdown in the report also was
negative, in that some lead time was anticipated before the
slaughter increased from the previous year.
    We expected farmers to increase hog operations, but we
didn't expect this degree of expansion to show up in a 10-state
spring report, Levitt added.
    High hog corn ratios (the number of bushels of corn that
could be bought for 100 lbs of hog) and the resulting increased
profits, encouraged farmers and confinement operations to
increase production starting late last year.
    Analysts also noted that part of the increase in the hog
herd resulted from a revision of the December report and
without the revision, the March report might have been very
close to average expectations.
    Robin Fuller of Agri Analysis said the USDA made a major
upward revision of 105,000 head in the size of the breeding
herd in the December 1 report. So the December report was more
bearish than initially indicated.
    But Fuller, as well as other analysts, expected the report
to be less negative on deferred futures contracts. Distant
contracts are already at a sharp discount to cash because
traders anticipated high farrowing intentions, she noted.
    Discounts in the October and December contracts take into
consideration a six to seven pct increase in March/May
farrowing intentions, which was borne out in the March 1
report, Fuller said.
    Grimes said, "As far as the distant months are concerned,
if our first quarter pig crop is up only six pct and under 60
lb inventories actually up only five pct, it would take a
tremendous discount in price for each percent increase for us
to push down to the prices that the current futures show for
the July and August period."
    Jerry Abbenhaus, analyst for AGE Clearing noted that
distant futures prices are already 15 to 20 dlrs lower than
they were last summer.
    "If cash hogs at the 7-markets last year averaged 61 dlrs
during July, that doesn't mean hogs have to be 15 dlrs cheaper
this year because we have six pct more numbers," he said.

dollar developments. The Thyssen group did over 50 pct of its

    Spethmann made no comment on 1986/87 group earnings. World
group net profit fell to 370.1 mln marks in the year ended
September 1986 from 472.4 mln a year earlier on group sales

year, but lower steel prices would result in a drop in steel
turnover and sales volume. This would also affect Thyssen's
trading operations, he said.

Office of Management and Budget
director James Miller said President Reagan opposes increases
in the federal excise taxes on gas, cigarettes or alcohol to
help reduce the federal budget deficit.
    In an address before a group of House Republicans, Miller
reiterated Reagan's opposition to an oil import duty. "I think
also he would opose an increase in the gas tax."
    He said there was no reason to think Reagan had changed his
opposition to a cigarette tax hike. "In the case of the
cigarette tax, we have no evidence the appropriate tax is
higher than now, and the same on wine and spirits."
    Miller urged the Republicans to hold firm against a tax
hike to reduce the estimated 174 billion dlr deficit for the
1988 financial year.
    House Democratic budget writers are expected to recommend
an 18 to 20 billion dlr revenue increase as part of the 1988
budget. However, the composition of the taxes would be left to
the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee to decide.
    Reagan's 1988 budget proposed 22 billion in revenue
increases from sales of federal assets such as the Amtrak
railroad, higher federal fees for services and larger
individual payments for social programs.
    "It's so essential to us to hold on that point of no tax
increase," Miller said.
    He added that House Speaker Jim Wright's proposal to set a
new tax on security transactions was "a nonstarter" with the
White House. The tax would be a tax on capital which would
discourage all but the most profitable short-term transactions
and could lead to creation of a duty-free market abroad.
    "Control spending, get the deficit down and oppose any tax
increase," Miller urged the Republicans.
    Congress has set 108 billion dlrs as its deficit target for
1988.

U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee
chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) said it would be impossible to
cut two billion dlrs from the fiscal 1988 agriculture budget as
proposed by Senate Budget Committee chairman Lawton Chiles
(D-Fla.)
    "I don't know how we could possibly absorb two billion dlrs
of cuts without enormous disruptions," Leahy told the National
Cattlemen's Association.
    Chiles has proposed making unspecified policy changes that
would trim two billion dlrs from farm income and price support
programs in the fiscal year beginning next October.
    Leahy said such cuts would be impossible, that one billion
dlrs in cuts would be "darn near impossible" and that a spending
freeze would be difficult.
    Leahy said Congress would have to provide "some money" for
the Farm Credit System, but that a "wholesale bailout" would not
be forthcoming.
    "We may need changes in (the system's) procedures but we
will not let the system go belly up or simply become another
bank," he said.
    A task force composed of Leahy and Sens. David Boren
(D-Okla.), Rudy Boschwitz (R-Minn.) and Richard Lugar (R-Ind.)
is working on a proposal for assisting the Farm Credit System
that Leahy said should be ready shortly after Congress's Easter
recess, set for April 13 through 20.
    Leahy said his panel would consider changes in the wheat
and feedgrains programs this year, including a proposal to
establish mandatory production controls.
    However, he said a bill offered by Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa)
and Rep. Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.) would probably not pass
Congress as presently written.
    A bill to provide emergency disaster assistance to
midwestern grain producers, already passed by the House, may
not be considered by the Senate for another 10 days because
members have lined up as many as two dozen amendments costing
billions of dollars, he said.

    In the centre-west region of Poitou-Charentes, plantings

area to last year's 671,100 harvested hectares, provided water
supplies are adequate in the Midi-Pyrenees region after the

Share and bond turnover on all eight
West German bourses in the first 1987 quarter was valued at
483.4 billion marks, according to the new method of calculating
turnover, the Association of German bourses said in a
statement.
    The statement, however, did not give figures on the total
number of share and bond units transacted.
    While shares posted a turnover worth 187.9 billion marks,
bond turnover was 295.4 billion marks. No comparative figures
were available because of the new method of calculation.
    In March, share and bond turnover rose 28 pct to 181.1
billion marks from the previous month, reversing the sharp
turnover drop in February. Average daily turnover rose to 8.2
billion marks against 7.0 billion in February.
    Bond turnover jumped 33 pct to 113.3 billion marks in
March, giving an average transaction value of 455,000 marks
each on the total 249,000 transactions. More than 90 pct of the
turnover was in public authority bonds.
    Share turnover rose 22 pct to 67.8 billion marks. With 1.5
mln deals, share transactions averaged 45,000 marks each.
    German shares accounted for Nearly 80 pct of share
turnover. Foreign shares took up over eight pct and domestic
and foreign options, about 12 pct. Deutsche Bank <DBKG.F> was
the most traded share in March, with 4.7 billion marks worth
changing hands. Siemens <SIEG.F> was next with 4.5 billion
marks, Bayer <BAYG.F> 4.0 billion, Volkswagen <VOWG.F> 3.4

The dollar straight sector of the
eurobond market ended easier after a subdued day's trading as
U.S. Banks began to match yesterday's surprise 1/4 point prime
rate hikes by Citibank and Chase Manhattan Bank, dealers said.
    The prime rates were raised to 7-3/4 from 7-1/2 pct and the
timing of the moves puzzled many dealers. However, reaction
here was limited, with shorter dated paper ending steady to 1/4
point easier, while longer dates dipped by 1/4 to 1/2 point.
    In the primary market, activity again centred on currencies
other than the U.S. Dollar, dealers noted.
    One dollar straight dealer at a U.S. Securities house
commented "There was, in fact, the odd retail buyer today, but
only in small sizes." He added that, ironically, the prime rate
rises may help the market to stabilise since the dollar rose on
the back of the news.
    The only U.S. Dollar deal launched during the day was, as
has been the case recently, equity linked. The 15-year
convertible bond was for the Bank of Tokyo Ltd and has an
indicated coupon of two pct. One source at a house involved in
the deal said, "It's got to be a blow-out. With a name like this
you're talking about Japan Inc."
    The lead manager was the Bank of Tokyo International (BOTI)
and the deal ended far above the par issue price at 108 109
pct. A BOTI official said "We've had worldwide interest in the
deal."
    She noted the Tokyo stock market had experienced a mild
correction at the beginning of the week but that bank stocks
were hardly affected.
    The yen sector edged slightly firmer and one new straight
deal was launched, a 20 billion yen bond for France's Caisse
Nationale des Telecommunications. The state guaranteed five
year bond pays 4-3/8 pct and was priced at 101-1/2 pct.
    The issue was lead managed by IBJ International Ltd and was
quoted on the grey market at less 1-7/8 less 1-3/4 pct compared
with the total fees of 1-7/8 pct. One syndicate official at a
firm not involved in the deal said "It's tight, but overall I
would say its fairly priced."
    Also launched was a five-year zero coupon bond with a total
redemption amount of 19 billion yen for Rural Banking and
Finance Corp of New Zealand. It was priced at 81.22 pct and
lead managed by Nomura International.
    In the Australian dollar sector, GMAC (Australia) Finance
Ltd issued a 50 mln Australian dlr bond.
    Hambros Bank Ltd was lead manager for the four-year deal
which pays 14-1/4 pct and was priced at 101 pct. It was
guranteed by General Motors Acceptance Corp and was quoted on
the 1-3/4 pct fees at less 1-3/4 pct bid.
    McDonalds Corp issued a 75 mln Canadian dlr bond paying
8-1/2 pct over five years and priced at 101-5/8 pct. It was
quoted around the 1-7/8 pct fees at less two less 1-3/4 and was
led by Morgan Guaranty Ltd.
    The European Investment Bank launched a 300 mln Danish
Crown, seven-year, bond withan 11 pct coupon and pricing of 101
pct. It was lead managed by Den Danske Bank.
    The floating rate note sector basically ended easier
following the increase in period eurodollar deposit rates
prompted by the prime rate increases, dealers said. But they
noted that mis-match deals - issues whereby the coupon is
re-fixed on a monthly basis - were firmer.

    Schulmann, speaking broadly about the global debt problem,
said that the International Monetary Fund should increase its
assistance to third world countries.
    The remarks come just before next week's meeting of the

Weatherford International Inc said it

held by bank and insurance company lenders.
    Under the agreement, the oil drilling equipment and oil
services company will pay reduced quarterly interest payments
on part of its bank revolving credit loans and industrial
revenue bonds. Remaining interest will be deferred until Jan 1,
1991.
    Principal payments will be deferred, with semi-annual
payments of 1.75 mln dlrs to start on Dec 31, 1989 and all
remaining principal due Jan 1, 1991.
    Additional interest and principal payments may be due on
the bank revolving credit lines if the company generates more
cash than it needs for operations.
    Term of the debt held by insurance company lenders will be
extended by one year until December 1990 by reducing the
principal due last year and this year. Otherwise, interest and
principal payments will continue to be made as scheduled in the
existing agreements.
    The proposed restructuring will reduce Weatherford's cash
requirements by about three mln dlrs in 1987 and 2.5 mln dlrs

will not have a material impact on future revenues and will

U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
Lawson said he wanted sterling to stay roughly where it was,
specifying a rate of around 2.90 marks and 1.60 dlrs.
    He told the National Economic Development Council that the
recent Paris meeting of major industrialised nations had agreed
on the need for exchange rate stability. There was now a
"reasonable alignment of currencies" and the U.K. Government
intended to keep sterling at about its present level, he said.
    That meant around 2.90 marks, which is the single most
important rate to concentrate on, and 1.60 dlrs, Lawson said.
    His disclosure of two of the key targets for sterling was
highly unusual, foreign exchange market analysts said.
    In the past he has preferred to be less definite about the
Government's exchange rate policy, lest it give foreign
exchange markets set limits to test.
    Lawson told the committee, which is a tripartite forum of
government, unions and industry, that the pound would be kept
near its present level by a mixture of interest rates and
intervention in the foreign exchange markets.
    The pound finished trading here today at 1.6040/50 dlrs and

Horn and Hardart Co said it
disposed of 33 Bojangles' Chicken 'N Biscuits restaurants in
Florida as part of its previously announced retrenchment of its
Bojangles' subsidiary.
    Terms were not disclosed.
    The company said the restaurants in Orlando, Tampa and
Jacksonville markets have incurred the majority of Bojangles'
operating losses over the last two years.
    Due to the transaction, Horn and Hardart is projecting a
positive cash flow for the unit for the remainder of fiscal
1987.
    A spokesman said the disposition consists of a combination
of sale, lease and re-franchise agreements.
    The transaction involves one-quarter of the company-owned
Bojangles' restaurants and is in accordance with its
restructuring program announced in October 1986.
    A spokesman said the company is considering the sale or
spinoff of the 91-company owned additional restaurants, which
are profitable.
    The company said the disposition will result in no profit
or loss for the company because the costs were anticipated in a
34-mln-dlr reserve taken in the third quarter of 1986.
    The foodservice division, which includes Burger King,
Arby's and Tony Roma's, had a pre-tax operating loss of 29.6
mln dlrs in 1986, including the 34.0 mln dlr charge to
restructure Bojangles. Excluding Bojangles', the group had
revenues of 43.8 mln dlrs.

has cut general and administrative expenses attributable to

    Cut were the company's first mortgage bonds and secured
pollution control issues to Baa-2 from Baa-1, and Eurobonds,
unsecured pollution control debt, unsecured medium-term notes
and preferred stock to Baa-3 from Baa-2. Niagara Mohawk's
Prime-2 commercial paper was left unchanged.

Mohawk's coverage of fixed charges.

The dollar's recent decline, despite
massive central bank purchases, is a forceful reminder that
official intervention in the foreign exchanges can work only if
it is well-timed to coincide with shifts in market fundamentals
or sentiment, dealers and analysts said.
    Central banks may succeed in slowing a trend, but, without
accompanying policy changes, they stand little chance of
reversing the direction of an ever-growing global market in
which more than 200 billion dlrs is traded every day, the
sources said.
    "Timing and psychology are the key to successful
intervention," said Jim O'Neill, a financial markets economist
with Marine Midland Banks Inc. The importance of complementary
changes in economic fundamentals was underlined yesterday when
a change in interest rates boosted the dollar, instantly
achieving what the central banks had tried in vain to do for a
week through open market intervention.
    After Citibank raised its prime rate by a quarter-point to
7-3/4 pct, the first change in the rate since last August, the
dollar started to advance and reached a high in Tokyo of 147.50
yen, up two yen from Tuesday's New York low.
    By contrast, monetary authorities spearheaded by the Bank
of Japan are estimated to have bought as much as 10 billion
dlrs in the last 10 days of March but could not prevent the
dollar from skidding through 150 yen and plumbing a 40-year low
Monday of 144.70 yen. Some experts worry the central banks have
lost more than just a temporary battle to prop up the dollar.
The market is wary of being caught wrong-footed by a central
bank foray, but is no longer mesmerized.
    "They've lost their credibility. The market feels it can
take on the central banks and win," said Michael Snow, head of
treasury operations at Union Bank of Switzerland in New York.
    The relative failure of recent intervention stands in sharp
contrast to the success that central banks scored when they
joined forces to drive the dollar down following the September
22, 1985, Plaza accord.
    Then, however, central banks had an easy time of it,
because the markets and the Treasuries of the major industrial
powers were agreed that the dollar needed to head lower to
redress massive worldwide trade imbalances.
    Now, there is no such consensus. The market is saying that
the dollar must fall further because the U.S. trade deficit is
showing little sign of improvement, while Japan is resisting in
a bid to protect its export industries.
    For its part, the United States is apparently content to
let the dollar fall gradually further and is paying little more
than lip service to the February Paris agreement of the Group
of Five plus Canada to foster stability, dealers say.
    Specifically, they said the Fed's dollar-buying
intervention has been half-hearted, designed more as a
political gesture to Japan than to strike fear into the
markets. "It's been pro-forma intervention," said Francoise
Soares-Kemp, chief corporate trader at Credit Lyonnais.
    Because of this discord and the market's momentum for a
lower dollar, analysts said intervention looks doomed to fail.
    "It's going to take a lot more than the central banks to
hold the dollar (at these levels)," said Snow, who predicts
another 10 to 15 pct depreciation.
    "There have to be structural changes that occur to make the
market stop selling dollars," added "Buying six billion dollars
in three weeks is not going to do it."
    Late last decade during the presidency of Jimmy Carter,
when the dollar was last under heavy speculative attack,
central banks sometimes intervened to the tune of six billion
dlrs in a single day but still failed to stop the dollar
falling to a record low of 1.70 marks, analysts said.
    Snow said purchases on that scale now are unlikely. "I
don't think anybody has the stomach for it, because they saw
the futility of it in the seventies."
    Indeed, because the market has grown in leaps and bound
since then, intervention on an even greater scale would
probably be needed to impress the market.
    Trading volume in London, New York and Tokyo alone last
year averaged nearly 188 billion dlrs a day, according to a
joint central bank study, about double the previous estimate
made just two years earlier by the Group of Thirty private
research group.
    There are signs that central banks, too, realize the
futility of swimming against the tide.

Conrac Corp, whose board has
rejected a 25 dlr a share tender offer from Mark IV Industries
Inc <IV>, said it is exploring alternatives such as a
restructuring, leveraged buyout or takeover of the company.
     In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Conrac said its board of directors authorized its financial and
legal advisors to explore a several alternatives to the Mark IV
offer, which it said it considers inadequate.
    The alternatives being explored include a restructuring,
leveraged buyout or a takeover of the company by another
company, Conrac said.
    Conrac, which said its board discussed the alternatives at
special meetings on March 26 and 30, said that its decision on
whether to adopt any of the alternatives would hinge on "the
future actions of Mark IV" and its unsolicitied tender offer.
    Putting into effect any of the alternatives being explored
could hurt or defeat the Mark IV offer, it said.
    Board members were also instructed to keep confidential the
terms of any transaction that might be entered into until it
becomes final, the company said.
    The board also took other defensive steps, including
granting severance agreements to some officers, it said.
    At a board meeting yesterday, Concac's directors deleted a
provision allowing the holder of at least one-third of of all
classes of its voting stock to call a special shareholders
meeting and deleted another provision allowing shareholders to
remove directors without cause, the company said.
    The defensive moves were taken because Mark IV had said it
planned to elect a majority of its designees as directors at a
special holders meeting if it succeeded in acquring a majority
of the company's common stock in the offer, Conrac said.
    Conrac's president, vice president and treasurer were given
severance agreements, or "golden parachutes," it said.
    Under the agreements, Conrac President Paul Graf would get
a cash payment of twice his annual salary, which was 209,906
dlrs last year, if there were a change of control in the
company, including acquisition of 30 pct or more of the
company's voting stock, Conrac said.
    Treasurer Joseph Smorada and Vice President Joseph
O'Donnell, who made 143,325 dlrs last year, would get
one-and-a-half times his salary if there were a change in
control. Smorada's salary was not listed in the SEC filing.

reopen the debate on restoring coffee export quotas, delegates
said.
    Talks have focused on administrative matters and
verification of stocks in producer countries, they said.
    Producers met briefly today to exchange views on the market
situation but there seems little chance discussion on quotas
will begin much before the ICO's annual council session in
September, they said.
    Delegates earlier thought the meeting would end tonight,
but a further session is scheduled tomorrow at 1030 GMT to
complete reports on stock verification.
    Meantime, the executive board will meet May 12 to discuss
possible action on the consultancy report on the ICO presented
today to the board, consumer delegates said.

E.F. Hutton Group's E.F. Hutton LBO Inc
unit said it extended the expiration date for its 35 dlr per
share tender offer for Purolator Courier corp to midnight EST
April six from midnight April one.
    E.F. Hutton lbo inc said its wholly owned PC Acquisition
Inc subsidiary, which is the entity making the offer, extended
both expiration date and the withdrawal rights period for its
pending tender for 6.3 mln shares or 83 pct of Purolator
common.
    Hutton's offer was topped today by a 40 dlr per share bid
for 83 pct of the stock from Emery Air Frieght Corp <EAF.>
    Both offers would pay shareholders a package of securities
for the balance of their shares, valued at the respective
tender offer prices.
    Hutton said as of the end of the day yesterday, about
880,000 shares of Purolator common stock repesenting 11.5 pct
of outstanding shares had been validly tendered and not
withdrawn.
    Manhattan supreme court justice Lewis Grossman today
adjourned until Monday a hearing on a stockholder suit seeking
to block the Hutton LBO transaction. The judge told attorneys
he needed time to hear other cases.
    Plaintiffs cited their belief that a superior offer would
be forthcoming, however one company mentioned in an affadavit,
Interlink Express plc, denied that it was interested.
    Yesterday, Frank Hoenemeyer, a retired vice chairman of
Prudential Insurance Co and currently a Purolator board member,
said an initial offer from Hutton was rejected by the board of
directors February third.
    Hoenemeyer testified that by the next meeting of the board,
February 17, Hutton submitted a revised proposal which was
accepted.
    He also testified a committee of directors had hired
Goldman Sachs and Co to consider alternatives to the Hutton
offer and also to consider a discussion of possible mergers
with other companies including Emery and Federal Express Corp
<FDX>.

U.S. farmers who reorganize their
operations to circumvent a cap on federal payments could add
2.3 billion dlrs to the cost of the government's agricultural
programs by 1989, the General Accounting Office, GAO, said.
    "We estimate that should the trend in farm reorganizations
continue, reorganizations since 1984 could be adding almost 900
mln dlrs annually to program costs by 1989," GAO Senior
Associate Director Brian Crowley said.
    "Cumulative costs for the six-year period, 1984 to 1989,
could approach 2.3 billion dlrs," he said.
    Between 1984 and 1986, reorganizations added almost 9,000
new persons to U.S. Agriculture Department payment rolls,
Crowley told the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Wheat,
Soybeans and Feedgrains.
    The GAO said at least part of the recent proliferation of
reorganizations was attributable to farmers' efforts to avoid
payment limits, although exactly how many subdivisions were
prompted by that concern were impossible to determine.
    Crowley said the two areas of primary concern were the
formation of corporations and the renting of farmland for cash
by individuals, partnerships or joint ventures with a large
number of participants.
    Subcommittee Chairman Dan Glickman, D-Kan., said evidence
that a "few bad apples" were using imaginative techniques to
skirt the payment limit jeopardized the "political credibility"
of U.S. farm programs.
    Without elaborating, Glickman said the committee would
consider legislation to "ensure than no one is tarnishing the
good name and the political support and popular support which
American agriculture so richly deserves."
    To improve the effectiveness of payment caps, Congress
could require that payments made to corporations, limited
partnerships or trusts be attributed to the individual payment
limitation of persons who are shareholders, members or
beneficiaries of those entities, Crowley said.
    "Attribution could be made at some specified level of
ownership interest such as five or ten pct," Crowley said.
    Currently, such entities qualify for an individual 50,000
dlr payment as long as no stockholder owns or controls more
than 50 pct of the stock.
    Crowley also suggested that payments could be restricted to
persons actively engaged in farming in some manner other than
just supplying financing.
    The Reagan administration proposed similar changes in
legislation it sent to Congress last month.
    Crowley said the GAO investigation uncovered problems with
USDA's administration of the payment limitation that
contributed to "the creation of new persons through
reorganization that are of questionable validity."
    Specifically, USDA county offices have inconsistently
applied a regulation requiring a reorganization to involve a
"substantive" change in the farming operation in order for any
new persons to qualify for payments.
    In addition, GAO found USDA officials in California were
incorrectly interpreting regulations relating to financing of
general partnership operations.
    Crowley also reported that in 401 U.S. counties having
about 90 pct of all foreign-owned cropland for all major crops,
total farm payments to foreign owners were 6.2 mln dlrs in 1984
and 7.7 mln in 1985.
    However, payments in 1985 represented only about 0.4 pct of
all payments made in the 401 counties, he said.

Pacific Gas and Electric Co's plan
to change its accounting methods for nuclear plant revenues,
together with the prospect of higher higher domestic interest
rates, helped push the company's stock price down 2-1/8 to 22,
utility analysts and company executives said.
    Pacific Gas said yesterday that a change in the method for
accounting for its Diablo Canyon Nuclear power plant revenues
will result in a 470 mln dlr reduction in 1987 earnings.
    The company also said it intends to continue paying its
common stock dividend at the current annual rate of 1.92 dlrs
per share.
    But the move also means that the company is not likely to
increase its dividend for perhaps as long as three years, said
Mark Luftig, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc.
    "Anybody looking for a dividend increase has been
dissapointed (by the announcement)," Luftig said.
    Pacific Gas has raised its common stock dividend on a
regular basis for the past 10 years, a company spokeswoman
said.
    In addition, she also pointed out that prospects for higher
interest rates may also be affecting Pacific Gas trading
activity.
    Citicorp <CCI> and Chase Manhattan Corp <CMB> yesterday
increased their prime lending rates to 7-3/4 pct from 7-1/2
pct. It was the first rate increase by the big banks in nearly
three years.
    Utility earnings are sensitive to interest rate increases
because of the high levels of borrowings needed to finance
ongoing construction projects.
    Despite the market reaction, First Boston Corp analyst
Arlene Barnes applauded the Pacific Gas decision.
    "This is a very prudent move on management's part," said
Barnes.
    Rather than using accounting tools to reflect income it is
not taking in, the company will now account for only the 40 pct
of the cost of owning and operating the plant that regulators
are allowing in the form of interim rate relief, Barnes said.
    Pacific Gas had been carrying the other 60 pct as a
deferred cash receivable and accounted for the non-cash item as
income.
    "They'll take the hit this year, but at least we'll be
looking at an honest earnings picture," Barnes also said.

    Some analysts said the latest, 306 mln dlr offer for
Purolator exceeded their expectations.
    Several analysts previously had said they saw takeover
values for the package delivery company in the 35 dlr per share
range. At least one, however, estimated the company could be
taken over in a range of 38 to 42 dlrs per share.
    Analysts today would not venture to say whether another
offer could be made, but some arbitragers still held to the
belief that the bidding could go higher.
    "They have no choice to seek out the best possible offer.
Emery has shown the courage to go forth," said one arbitrager,
who speculated other courier companies may also emerge as
bidders.
    "It makes sense," said James Parker of Robinson Humphrey.
But "It won't make out as well as they think. They won't get a
100 pct of the synergies."
    Analysts said the acquisition could cost Emery earnings in
the short term, but long term, after eliminating redundancies
and selling other Purolator assets, it should boost Emery's
profitability.
    Parker said a combined Purolator and Emery would rival
United Parcel Service as the second largest U.S. package
delivery company after Federal Express Corp <FDX>, which has 47
pct of the market.
    Parker speculated that the combined Emery-Purolator would
have about 24 pct of the six to seven billion dlr delivery
business.
    "This will make Emery a bigger factor in the light weight
(delivery) business, but it will not make them a power house,"
said Douglas Arthur of Kidder, Peabody and Co.
    Purolator today declined comment on the Emery offer, and
its chairman Nicholas Brady did not return a phone call.
    E.F.Hutton LBO also declined comment on the Emery offer,
but said it extended the expiration and withdrawal period on
its offer to April six at midnight from today at midnight EST.
    One analyst speculated the extension makes it more likely
Hutton will attempt another offer. However, he was skeptical a
company outside the package delivery industry would want to
outbid 40 dlrs per share because it would not have the same 
synergies as a courier company.
    Since Purolator agreed in late February to a buyout by some
of its management and the E.F. Hutton Group <EFH> subsidiary,
speculation has arisen that more bidding was to come.
    The buyout was surrounded by controversy since a Purolator
board member, Doresy Gardner resigned in March. Gardner said he
believed a better offer could be made by another entity.
    A spokesman for Gardner today said the former director had
no contact with Emery, nor did he have any other buyers lined
up for Purolator.
    Purolator's deal with Hutton was also called into question
by a shareholder suit filed earlier this week, which attempted
to stop the tender offer to allow another bidder to come forth.
Hearings in a New York state court were delayed until Monday.
    Arbitragers had said they believed the Hutton offer could
be bettered because the Wall Street firm was not planning to
keep its cash tied up in Purolator. Hutton is providing a 279
mln dlr "bridge" loan that would later be replaced with other
debt. Hutton would maintain a majority interest in Purolator.
    Hutton sources have said the firm was in fact facing risk n
its investment since it did not know when it could reclaim its
279 mln dlr loan.
    Emery last year lost 5.4 mln dlrs on revenues of 887.5 mln
dlrs. Purolator lost 57.6 mln dlrs on 841.4 mln dlrs in
revenues.

<Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce>
said it was lowering the interest rate on its Visa credit card
to 15.9 pct from 18.6 pct, effective with the May billing
statement.
    The bank said it was also halving its yearly Visa card user
fee to six dlrs, but would retain its 15 ct fee for each
transaction.
    A bank spokesman said the previously reported call by the
Canadian Parliament's finance committee on March 20 for a
substantial cut in credit card rates "was a factor" in the
move, but he would not elaborate.
    Canada's minister of state for finance Thomas Hockin had
threatened legislation to reduce the rates, which apply to
unpaid balances, if the financial institutions did not
voluntarily act.
    The Canadian Imperial Bank spokesman said "the bank card
market is a very competitive one and we have to move to stay
competitive."
    Canadian Imperial's new rates match those of <Toronto
Dominion Bank>, which lowered its rates before the finance
committee report.
    Canadian Imperial Bank added that cardholders will be
allowed to choose between the 15 ct transaction fee or the six
dlr yearly card fee.
    It will also eliminate the 50 ct minimum monthly
transaction fee, it said.
    Minister of State for Finance, Tom Hockin, said in the
House of Commons today he was "delighted" with the bank's cut
in its credit card rate.
    "I would hope retail stores and other financial
institutions will look to their rates as well," Hockin said
during the daily question period.

Rumors that New York investor Asher
Edelman has acquired a stake in Polaroid Corp and optimism
about tomorrow's status hearing on the patent infringement suit
pending with Eastman Kodak Co <EK> sent Polaroid's stock
higher, traders said.
    Polaroid rose 1-1/8 to 74-1/2.
    "Speculation that Edelman was going to take a stake in
Polaroid was kicking around a few months ago, and resurfaced
today," one trader said.
    Edelman had no comment on the rumors.
    A spokesman for Polaroid said the company had not been
contacted by Edelman and no filing had been made with the
Securities and Exchange Commission about a stake in the
company.
    "There is some hope among investors that there will some
progress in the status hearing tomorrow on the patent
infringement suit with Kodak," analyst Michael Ellmann of
Wertheim and Co said.
    Traders said it is conceivable that a trial date could be
set or some progress made on an out-of-court settlement.
    The suit, filed by Polaroid in April 1976, charges that
Kodak infringed upon Polaroid's instant camera patent. In
October 1985, the court barred Kodak from selling cameras or
film that infringe upon the patent, the Polaroid spokesman
said.
    Ellmann said he feels it is highly unlikely that any
progress will be made in tomorrow's hearing.
    Ellmann said the stock may have also gotten a boost today
from some optimism concerning new products the company is
currently working on.
    "Polaroid's announcement that a particularly senior company
executive had been chosen to work on a major unidentified new
product spurred some speculation about their products," he
said. "I am speculating that the new product could be an
electronic still camera," referring to a camera that records
its images on magnetic disks as opposed to conventional film.

New York coffee futures prices will
probably fall to about 85 cents a lb in the next month before a
consolidation trend sets in, according to market analysts.
    Yesterday, prices for the spot May contract fell below 1.00
dlr a lb for the first time since August 1981 after the
International Coffee Organization did not place new export
quota discussions on its current agenda.
    Talks aimed at renegotiating ICO export quotas, after five
years of price-supporting agreements, broke down in February.
    "Short-term, it looks like a definite test of 90 cents,
perhaps 85 cents," said William O'Neill, coffee analyst with
Elders Futures. "But the additional downside may not be all
that great from current levels."
    "At this price level the market is very vulnerable to
bullish developments," O'Neill added. "Rather than us having a
market that will plummet we'll kind of see prices erode --
probably to around 85 cents."
    "I definitely see 90 cents and would not rule out a brief
drop to 85 cents," said Debra Tropp, a coffee analyst with
Prudential Bache. But she said by June worries about a freeze
in Brazil growing areas will become more of a market factor,
with prices likely to consolidate ahead of that time.
    A trader at a major international trade house, who asked
not to be named, said he expects a 10 cent drop near term but
believes if Brazil opens May registrations at a relatively high
export price and requires a high contribution quota from
exporters the market could steady at the lower levels.
    Longer term, he added, producer pressure will mount on
Brazil to agree to consumers' export quota terms, and a new
international agreement could come into force next fall.
    Since the February talks broke down, the market has fallen
from about 130.00 cents a lb to a low of 98.10 cents a lb
today, as buyers and sellers sought to reassess supply and
demand.
    Generally, analysts say, producers have a large buildup of
stocks, but U.S. roasters have drawn down supplies and will
need to do some buying soon.
    "Most producing nations have just completed or are about to
complete their annual harvests and exportable supplies are at
their seasonal peak. Exports remain behind year ago and
warehouses in producer nations are becoming increasingly
overburdened," said Sandra Kaul, coffee analyst for Shearson
Lehman, in that firm's forthcoming quarterly coffee report.
    Kaul said producers' need to procure hard currency to
service foreign debt will put further pressure on them to sell,
and "this should keep substantial pressure on exporters to
undertake sales despite the drop in prices to six year lows."
    Kaul believes the market will drop to 80 cents a lb before
Brazil's frost season begins in June.
    Accurate assessments of roaster demand are hard to come by,
though analysts note the peak winter consumption period is
passed and demand usually slows this time of year.
    Shearson's Kaul estimated U.S. roaster ending stocks as of
January 31, including soluble and roasted, at 6.3 mln bags
compared with 6.9 mln at end-September 1986, a small drawdown
for the usually busy winter roasting season.
    But Elders O'Neill said, "The roasters are not overstocked
by any means."
    Analysts said picking a bottom to the market is difficult,
given the fact prices have fallen into uncharted territory
below the long-term support at 1.00 dlr per lb, and several
traders said the sidelines might be preferable for the short
term.

U.S. refiners said they are worried
that growing supplies of imports, proposed federal
environmental regulations, and the marketing of a third grade
of unleaded gasoline would cost them dearly and at a time when
the industry is recovering from a recent slump.
     "We have to look at national security and cut the amount
of products and crude coming into the country if it hurts the
industry," said Archie Dunham, vice president of petroleum
products at Conoco, subsidiary of DuPont Corp (DD).
    U.S. oil imports account for about 38 pct of U.S.
consumption but are expected to rise to 50 pct by the mid
1990s, according to the Department of Energy.
    "Can we afford to import 60 or 70 pct of our oil
requirements 15 or so years from now?" asked John Swearingen,
chairman of the board of Continental Illinois Corp <CIL> and
former chief executive of Amoco Corp <AN>. "If your answer to
that question raises doubt, then it behooves us to do all that
we can now to cope with this situation and improve our
position."
    But Swearingen said he opposed the idea of an import fee, a
view echoed by others attending this week's National Petroleum
Refiners Association meeting in San Antonio, Texas.
    "Talk of an import surcharge or controls is not encouraging
because those things won't solve our problems and could well
compound them," said Swearingen. "Once the government affects
values, once an import quota or license has value, it's going
to be subverted by government," he added.
     William Martin, deputy Energy Secretary, said the costs of
an import fee outweigh its benefits and suggested, as Energy
Secretary John Herrington has, depletion tax credits to
encourage domestic production and limit oil imports. He also
said altnerative energy sources should be encouraged.
     Restoration of the depletion allowance for a 27 pct
deduction from the taxable income of oil companies is 
controversal but might work, said Dunham.
    Dunham and other officials opposed the idea of a fee on oil
imports but said if one is enacted it must tax crude and
product imports.
    "Why would companies import crude when they could import
products for a smaller cost if there were only a fee on crude?"
asked Henry Rosenberg, chairman of Crown Central Petroleum
<CNP>.
     An import fee would raise the costs of U.S. petrochemical
products and make them noncompetive on the world market, Dunham
said.
     "The energy security issue should be considered when
environmental issues are considered," Martin said.
    "The level of investment for the proposed lowering of
sulfur level of diesel to 0.05 pct by weight, for example, is
unacceptable," Dunham said. "Most companies cannot afford it."
    George Unzelman, president of HyOx, Inc., said these
proposals "will place pressure on small refining operations and
promote further industry consolidation."
     An NPRA survey of of 139 refineries, which was released at
the conference, said reducing sulphur content to 0.05 pct
weight and aromatics to 20 volume pct aromatics in highway
diesel fuel would cost refiners 6.65 billion dlrs.
     The national average diesel fuel sulfur content in 1986
for the survey respondents was 0.27 weight pct while the
average aromatics content was 32 pct.
     Another possible cost to refiners is the upgrading of
facilities to produce a third grade of unleaded gasoline which
is beginning to be marketed by some companies.
    "What will be the standard octane level in various grades
of unleaded gasoline?" asked Dunham. "A midlevel grade of
unleaded gasoline with an octane level of 89 means an
investment has to be made," Dunham said.
     This grade is not warranted, said Crown's Rosenberg.
     Despite these concerns, refiners are expecting margins to
move higher in the next few months.
     "We are beginning to see a return in wholesale margins,"
said Roger Hemminghaus, chairman of the refining and marketing
company that is to spin off from Diamond Shamrock Corp <DIA>.
     Margins are higher because the OPEC pact is holding, U.S.
stocks of gasoline and heating oil are declining, and gasoline
demand is rising as the driving season approaches, he said.
     "This summer could be a good season for selling gasoline,"
Hemminghaus said, adding that the new company will be primarily
a gasoline producer.

The french government formally abolished
rules suspended since last September setting limits on the
import and sale of refined oil products from outside the
European Community.
    The rules, introduced in 1979, required importers to buy at
least 80 pct of their refined products from European refiners,
while at least 90 pct of refined products sold in France were
required to come from French or European refiners.
    The abolition of the rules, together with a number of
relaxations in administrative procedures, was published in the
official journal today.
    French oil industry officials immediately criticised the
move as encouraging imports at a time when french refiners are
making heavy losses.
    Industry figures published in February showed industrywide
losses of three billion francs last year after taking into
account extraordinary losses on stock depreciation.

Dome Petroleum Ltd's loss of 2.20
billion dlrs, believed to be the biggest ever by a Canadian
company, will have little impact on daily operations but will
pressure creditors to accept a proposal to restructure Dome's
debt of more than 6.10 billion dlrs, industry analysts said.
    "Essentially what it (Dome's loss) does is put more focus on
the importance of the restructuring and puts more pressure on
creditors to agree to the debt rescheduling," said an oil
analyst who asked that he not be identified.
    Dome reported earnings yesterday.
    Analysts said the huge loss improves the appeal of a debt
accord by underlining company statements that creditors would
receive little or nothing under a forced liquidation that could
take several years to complete.
    After several months of negotiations with a group of 56
major creditors and other unsecured public debt holders, Dome
submitted a complex proposal earlier this month that includes
converting debt to equity and extending repayment time.
    "They've had their talks and now they have the proposal, so
the banks have to decide whether to accept the restructuring or
pull the plug," the analyst said.
    He and others said the huge loss, including writedowns
totalling 2.08 billion dlrs before a 571 mln dlr reduction in
deferred income taxes, dramatically enforces the company's
claim that a 50 pct drop in world oil prices has crippled its
financial position.
    But analysts said the writedown only impacts Dome's balance
sheet and does not hurt the company's cash position.
    "To a large extent, these writeoffs of the carrying value of
assets is really just the bookkeepers catching up to what the
stock market has been telling us for a long time, reflecting
the collapse in oil prices," Peters and Co Ltd analyst Wilf
Gobert said.
    Dome reported it took a 1.20 billion charge in the fourth
quarter, before a 305 mln dlr reduction in deferred income
taxes, for the decline in value of Dome's oil and gas
properties.
    The extraordinary loss conformed with new Canadian
Institute of Chartered Accountants guidelines that require Dome
to use average 1986 oil prices to value its holdings, instead
of an escalating price method used in prior years.
    Analysts said six individual Swiss noteholders, who
initiated legal action against Dome to recover debt of 408,500
dlrs, will also be pressed to adopt a more lenient stand by the
1986 results.
    "To the extent that individuals were not fully accepting or
cognizant of the seriousness of Dome's financial position, the
financial statements reflecting this writedown of the value of
assets is certainly going to indicate the depth of the
hemorrhaging that has taken place," Gobert said.
    The legal action now before Swiss courts threatens to
trigger cross-defaults on all of Dome's debt, toppling the
delicate debt negotiations. Dome is next scheduled to appear
April six to defend against the action.
    First Marathon Securities Ltd analyst Rick Hallisey said
the size of the loss was slightly larger than industry
estimates of Dome's negative net worth, ranging between 1.50
billion and two billion dlrs.
    "What this writedown says is that a lot of the money that
was spent in the past is unrecoverable, but the shareholders
have already recognized that through the writedown in the stock
price," Gobert said, adding, "The financial statements have come
out and said that what has happened in the past has been a
disaster for Dome," Gobert added.
    The price of Dome common shares fell five cts to 1.05 dlrs
in trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange today. At the height
of Dome's success in 1981, common traded at about 25 dlrs a
share.

Johnstown American Cos said it began a

preferred stock.
    Under the offer, the company said holders of the preferred
would receive one share of a new issue of convertible
redeemable preferred stock for each share of their 1985
preferred.
    The company said terms of the new preferred will permit it
to redeem and retire the 1985 preferred shares at a discount
from their current liquidation value of 50 mln dlrs, or 100
dlrs a share.
    The company said that if all the 1985 preferred shares are
tendered, it will issue 500,000 1987 preferred shares, disburse
250,000 dlrs and cancel all 1985 preferred shares that are
tendered.
    The company said that if it elects to redeem the 1987
preferred, it must pay holders 12.3 mln dlrs in cash.
    It said it must also issue warrants for the purchase of
three mln common shares at a price of 4.50 dlrs a share or 33
pct over the market price on the day before the notice of
redemption, whichever is greater.
    The company said the exchange offer is conditioned on
tendering shareholders releasing certain rights to contingent
payouts and profit-share interests that were given in
connection with its 1985 acquisition of Consolidated Capital
Equities Corp and Johnstown Management Co.

Democrats rammed through the House
Budget Committee a trillion dollar U.S. spending budget for
1988 over Republican protests.
    After a brief partisan debate in which Republicans said
they were kept in the dark about the plan, the committee
approved the budget by voice vote and sent it to the full
House. 
    It was the first major congressional action on a U.S.
budget for the government year starting October 1 this year.
    President Reagan has had his own budget virtually ignored
by Democrats and fellow Republicans alike.
    The House budget would cut the deficit about 38 billion
dlrs off an estimated 171-billion-dlr deficit for a 133-
billion-dlr deficit, using Congressional Budget Office
estimates.
    Using President Reagan's more optimistic economic
assumptions, committee Democrats said the deficit would be 107
billion -- the goal of a new budget law designed to gradually
end deficits by 1991.
    The estimated deficit for this year is about 175 billion
dlrs.

The National Broadcasting Co delivered
its "final offer" for a new contract to representatives of
2,800 writers, editors and technicians early today and waited
for a response.
    A committee of the National Association of Broadcast
Employees and Technicians discussed the offer but after three
hours they had not come to any decision.
    If the union walks out it would mean simultaneous strikes
against all three major U.S. television networks. A different
union struck CBS Inc <CBS> and Capital Cities/ABC Inc <CCB> a
month ago. NBC is owned by the General Electric Co <GE>.
    "We're instructing all our members to continue working
without a contract," said John Krieger, a union official. The
contract expired at midnight March 31.
    Krieger said the committee is empowered to call a strike if
it sees fit but he added, "we're not gun shy and we're not
strike-happy, we don't take it lightly." He said the union
needed time to draft a formal response to the NBC proposal,
which the network billed as its "best and final offer."
    A spokeswoman for NBC said management personnel were
prepared to take assume technical duties if its radio and
television facilities are struck.
    "If there were a strike, we would not expect any
interruption in our service," the NBC spokeswoman said. At CBS
and ABC, where the Writers Guild of America has been on strike
since early March, viewers have noticed little difference in
the programs. However technicians are not involved in the
walkout at CBS and ABC.
    Krieger said the "major stumbling block" in the talks with
NBC was the network's insistence on having the right to hire
engineers and writers on a daily basis. "In a broad sense this
would decimate the union," he said, with temporary workers
jeopardizing the jobs of staff employees.
    NBC said its proposal "contains assurances that there is no
intention to replace regular employees with daily hires." NBC
said regular employees who may be on layoff would be offered
employment first.
    NBC also said any daily hires would be represented by the
union and would be phased in at four pct of regular staff in
the first year of a contract and six percent afterward.
    Top scale wages would increase to 855 dlrs per week in the
first year of the two-year contract and 895 dlrs in the second
year, under the NBC proposal. Krieger said the network's wage
proposals were "disappointing" but not the main issue.
    NBC said its proposals would give it greater flexibility in
sports and news coverage. It said its proposals would permit
limited access to news materials from affiliates and
subscription services and allow Cable News Network to join
network pool facilities. Cable News Network is owned by Turner
Broadcasting System <TBS>.
    Material from subscription servoces would be limited to an
average of about one minute in a half-hour program, NBC said.
The network said the changes it seeks "would reduce costly
duplication and are vital to NBC's long term health."
    The major U.S. networks have experienced cost cutting
campaigns following a series of ownership changes that affected
the parent companies of all three in the past two years.
    Laurence Tisch became the largest shareholder in CBS, NBC's
former parent RCA was acquired by General Electric and ABC was
merged into Capital Cities Broadcasting.
    The broadcast operations have been hit with layoffs and
other belt-tightening measures. Network executives cited cable
television services and video cassette players which compete
for viewers.

After an already steep fall in the past
week, U.S. interest rate futures may be in for further declines
in the near term, financial analysts said.
    However, some analysts said recent sharp losses in bond
futures have left the bond market somewhat oversold, and the
contracts on long-term debt could stage a recovery before
resuming their decline.
    Key to the near-term direction of futures will be the
course of the dollar, they said.
    "As the dollar goes, so goes the bond market," said Dean
Witter analyst Karen Gibbs.
    The recent decline in the dollar, which hit a 40-year low
against the Japanese yen Monday, was reversed Wednesday when
several large U.S. money center banks unexpectedly raised their
prime lending rates by a quarter point, to 7-3/4 pct.
    "Even though the prime rate cut was good for the dollar,
foreign exchange traders are not convinced the dollar decline
is over," Gibbs said.
    The dollar decline was key in recent weakness in debt
futures as it rekindled concern about a pickup in inflation.
    Indeed, the falling dollar may have been a key topic at the
meeting of the Federal Reserve's policy making arm, the Federal
Open Market Committee, this week, analysts said.
    "To the Fed, the combination of a falling dollar, a
steepening yield curve, and rising commodity prices look
suspiciously like the traces of expectations of accelerating
inflation," said Denis Karnosky, analyst at Carroll, McEntee
and McGinley Inc.
    Such expectations could mean that "a shift in policy toward
restriction of bank reserves is likely to get very serious
consideration," at the FOMC meeting, he said.
    Any such restriction of reserves will not be a highly
visible form of monetary tightening, Karnosky said.
    Rather, the key to detecting a change will be found in
seasonal and adjustment borrowing at the discount window, he
said. Borrowings have held near a weekly average of 300 mln
dlrs over the past several months, he said.
    In the meantime, however, "the market looks a bit
oversold," said Jim Wysoglad, analyst at Golden Gate Futures.
    Wysoglad said a recovery from the oversold condition could
drive June bonds to a high near 99 before falling back to test
chart support near the recent low of 97-13/32.
    Technician Leslie Keefe of Technical Data Corp of Boston
said that the key test for June bonds will be whether the
nearby contract holds above chart support at 96-24/32.
    "All previous selloffs since mid-November have stopped and
buyers have surfaced at that level," Keefe said.
    If that level is broken, and the dollar continues to
decline, Keefe said she expects the June bond contract to
decline to test support between 92 and 93, the primary uptrend
line dating back to 1984.

Coffee futures dipped further today and
closed below 1 dlr a pound for the first time in six years.
    Coffee for delivery in May ended at 99.28 cents a pound on
the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, down 0.76 cent and the
lowest price since August, 1981.
     Prices have been falling steadily since the International
Coffee Organization failed in February to reach an agreement
controlling exports by its members, and pressure was renewed
this week as the executive board of the organization met in
London without reopening debate on its export quotas.
    The executive board has limited its current discussions to
administrative matters and is set to adourn Thursday.
    Burdensome supplies have pressed the market down from 1.30
dlr a pound in February, when the organization's discussions
aimed at re-establishing export quotas broke down.
    Sandra Kaul, a coffee analyst in New York with Shearson
Lehman Brothers, said supplies currently are at their high
point for the year because most producing nations have just
completed their harvests.
    In addition, she said, many of those nations are faced with
serious debt and need to sell coffee to raise capital.
    "This should keep substantial pressure on exporters to
undertake sales despite the drop in prices," she said.
    Further, U.S. demand could be sluggish because winter, the
period of greatest consumption, is ending. Prices could fall
another 10 cents to 15 cnts a pound, analysts said.
    Gold futures retreated from modest early gains and closed
steady while silver prices rallied on the Commodity Exchange in
New York.
    The increase in U.S. banks' prime rates prompted concern
about renewed inflation, but the strength of the U.S. dollar
discouraged new buying.
    "The market is getting mixed signals and it doesn't know
which way to go," one analyst said.

effective today that will decrease revenues by about 412,000

    The decrease results from changes in the base rates and in
the fuel cost adjustment rate charged by the company.
    Base rates will decrease by 6.25 mln dlrs due largely to
its sale in the Seabrook nuclear power project, a reduction in
federal income taxes and lower costs of capital.
    The base rate assumes a rate of return of 11.57 pct, down

Coffee futures dipped further and closed
below one dlr a pound for the first time in six years.
    Coffee for delivery in May ended at 99.28 cents a pound on
the New York Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, down 0.76 cent
and the lowest price since August, 1981.
     Prices have fallen steadily since the International Coffee
Organization failed in February to reach an agreement
controlling exports by its members, and pressure was renewed
this week as the executive board of the organization met in
London without reopening debate on its export quotas.
    The executive board has limited its current discussions to
administrative matters and is set to adourn Thursday.
    Burdensome supplies have pressed the market down from 1.30
dlrs a pound in February, when the organization's discussions
aimed at re-establishing export quotas broke down.
    Sandra Kaul, a coffee analyst in New York with Shearson
Lehman Brothers, said supplies currently are at their high
point for the year because most producing nations have just
completed their harvests.
    In addition, she said, many of those nations are faced with
serious debt and need to sell coffee to raise capital.
    "This should keep substantial pressure on exporters to
undertake sales despite the drop in prices," she said.
    Further, U.S. demand could be sluggish because winter, the
period of greatest consumption, is ending. Prices could fall
another 10 to 15 cents a pound, analysts said.
    Gold futures retreated from modest early gains and closed
steady while silver prices rallied on the Commodity Exchange in
New York.
    The increase in U.S. banks' prime rates prompted concern
about renewed inflation but the strength of the U.S. dollar
discouraged new buying.
    "The market is getting mixed signals and it doesn't know
which way to go," one analyst said.
    Cattle futures posted new highs on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, while live hogs rallied from early losses and frozen
pork bellies finished sharply lower.
    Cattle prices continued to draw support from the winter
storm that swept the Plains states, leaving animals stranded in
snowbound fields and feed lots in miserable condition.
    Live hogs were pressured early by the Agriculture
Department's report Tuesday that producers expanded their
breeding herds more than the market expected last quarter.
Prices recovered to keep pace with higher cash prices.
    Frozen pork bellies fell sharply on the outlook for greater
production and closed with limit losses.
    Soybean futures posted sharp gains on the Chicago Board of
Trade, while corn and wheat were lower.
    Soybeans rallied in response to Tuesday's USDA report that
farmers intend to plant 56.9 mln acres this year, down from
61.5 mln planted last year.
    Corn prices were pressured by the outlook for 67.6 mln
acres of corn, which is down from last year's 76.7 mln acres,
but was larger than analysts expected.

Stanley Simon was charged with
extorting 50,000 dlrs from a defense contractor in the first
indictment in a corruption probe involving two Congressmen, a
former aide to President Reagan and other government officials.
    Simon, who resigned last month as Bronx Borough President,
was accused of extorting the money and forcing the now bankrupt
contractor, the Wedtech Corp., to hire his brother-in-law and
then give him raises.
    Simon is also accused of perjury and forcing one of his
employees to pay him 14,000 dlrs in salary kickbacks.
    He is the first public official to be indicted for
demanding money from Wedtech, a minority-owned company that
builds pontoon bridges for the Defense Department.
    "Wedtech was one of the success stories in the Bronx, but
the company was manipulated and raped," Thomas Scheer, the head
of the FBI's New York office, said of the payoffs the company
allegedly made to win contracts.
    Wedtech executives have said they paid bribes to about 20
government officials.
    Law enforcement sources say two Bronx congressmen, Mario
Biaggi and Robert Garcia, are under investigation.

determine whether former Reagan aide Lyn Nofziger acted

that Milton Benjamin had resigned as company president and the

    The agency, which emerged from bankruptcy court protection
when Vazquez-Rana bought it for 41 mln dlrs last June, has had
four presidents over the past year.
    Benjamin, who had served in the post since last November,
said he was stepping down because restoring UPI would take a
greater financial investment than he had envisaged and
Vasquez-Rana thus wished to take direct control.
    "In recent weeks, Mario (Vazquez-Rana) has indicated that in
light of the increased investment, he wants to devote even more
time to UPI and to play a more direct role in managing its
financial affairs," Benjamin said in a statement.
    Benjamin said he would return to his consulting firm of
Anderson, Benjamin, Read and Haney Inc., which he founded in
1984. He left the firm on November six last year to take over
as president of UPI.
    Besides Benjamin and Vazquez-Rana, the other presidents
have been Luis Nogales, a California businessman who helped
steer the agency through bankruptcy proceedings, and Maxwell
McCrohon, former editor and managing editor of the Chicago
Tribune.
    Vazquez-Rana, who is both chairman and chief executive
officer of UPI, is the publisher of a successful chain of 62

Deutsche Bank AG <DBKG.F> has seen a
slow start to 1987 after posting record profits in 1986,
management board joint spokesman F. Wilhelm Christians said.
    Credit business declined in the first few weeks of the
year, and the interest margin was squeezed further. The weak
German bourse saw earnings on commission fall sharply, and
trading in securities also fell. But earnings from currency
dealing were still satisfactory, he told a news conference.
    Deutsche group partial operating profits rose to 3.78
billion marks in 1986 from 2.92 billion in 1985 on a balance
sheet of 257.22 billion marks after 237.23 billion.
    Profits were swollen by earnings from the placement of the
former Flick group, which have been estimated at some one
billion marks, and from record profits in trading on the bank's
own account, not included in partial operating profits.
    Earnings from the Flick transaction were booked through a
subsidiary, and therefore showed up as part of the interest
surplus in a section current earnings from securities and
participations.
    In the group this nearly doubled to 2.64 billion marks from
1.45 billion.
    As usual the bank did not detail total operating profits.
    But it said that total operating profits, including own
account trading, rose 24.9 pct or 4.5 pct without the Flick
transaction in the group, and 35.1 pct or seven pct in the
parent bank.
    Banking analysts said this put group total operating
profits at some 6-1/2 to seven billion marks, and parent bank
operating profits at over five billion marks.
    Christians said Deutsche used the extraordinary earnings
from Flick to pay a record five mark bonus on top of its
unchanged 12 mark dividend.
    The bank had decided against raising the dividend itself
because of the uncertain business outlook at the end of 1986,
and developments so far this year showed that was correct,
Christians said.
    West German banks rarely raise dividends unless they are
sure they can maintain the increased payout in subsequent
years, preferring to use bonuses for one-of profits.
    The bank also used its extraordinary earnings to continue a
high level of risk provision, Christians said.
    Disclosed group risk provisions rose to 867 mln marks in
1986 from 765 mln in 1985.
    Under German law, disclosed provisions do not necessarily
reflect the full amount of risk provisions.
    Management board joint spokesman Alfred Herrhausen said
Deutsche's total debt exposure to problem countries had fallen
to over six billion marks in 1986 from 7.4 billion in 1985
because of the fall in the dollar.
    He agreed with a questioner who asked if over two thirds of
such problem country debt had been written off.
    Deutsche Bank posted a sharp rise in holdings of "other
securities," to 4.64 billion marks from 2.71 billion in the
parent bank.
    Christians said this 1.93-billion-mark rise was partly due
to its increased activity in international share placements,
with some shares such as those from Fiat SpA's international
placement last year remaining on its books.
    Herrhausen said that no concrete measures were planned to
place these shares and conclude the original placement.

Deutsche Bank AG <DBKG.F> has agreed
to take over the outstanding 25 pct in <Deutsche Bank (Asia)
AG>, the former <European Asian Bank AG>, from
Creditanstalt-Bankverein <CABV.VI>, Deutsche management board
joint spokesman Alfred Herrhausen told a news conference.
    Euras broke even in 1986 and required no funding from
Deutsche, he said. He gave no details of the deal with
Creditanstalt.
    Press reports that Deutsche was planning a takeover of
Lloyds Bank plc <LLOY.L> were without foundation, he said.
    Herrhausen said Deutsche had taken part in the recent
capital increase of <Morgan Grenfell Group plc>, but had no
plans to raise its 4.4 pct share in Morgan Grenfell.
    <Banca d'America e d'Italia SpA>, in which 98.3 pct was
acquired from Bankamerica Corp <BAC.N> late last year, would be
consolidated this year, and contribute to further expansion of
Deutsche's business, management board joint spokesman F.
Wilhelm Christians said.
    Following a ruling earlier this year from the Federal High
Court, Deutsche had included its non-bank holdings in the
balance sheet section "participations," Christians said.
    But Christians said the bank still regarded shares in these
non-bank companies as an investment rather than an active
participation.
    Parent bank total participations rose to 6.45 billion marks
in 1986 from a comparable 4.57 billion in 1985 including a rise
to 3.79 billion from 2.34 billion in bank participations.
    Herrhausen said the grouping of holdings in the balance
sheet in this was was not a first step to floating them off in
a separate holding company.

A world recession is unlikely this
year as fiscal and monetary policy in most industrialized
countries is supporting the economy, Deutsche Bank AG <DBKG.F>
management board joint spokesman Alfred Herrhausen said.
    But growth rates will be smaller than last year, with 1.5
to 2.5 pct likely in most industrialized countries, he told a
news conference.
    Herrhausen said he was confident private consumption would
support economic growth in West Germany this year, with net
income increases turning into purchasing power as long as
inflation did not revive.
    Herrhausen said he did not expect interest rates to rise in
West Germany this year, but there was little room for further
falls. Rates in the U.S. were however rising, as evidenced by
the latest prime rate moves, but this rise would be moderate.
    Herrhausen said he did not expect any major narrowing of
the U.S. Trade and budget deficits in the next few months.
    One success of the Paris agreement in February to foster
currency stability was that U.S. Officials have stopped talking
down the dollar, he noted.
    The recent stability would last until markets decided to
test the resolve of central banks, he said.
    He noted that central banks had spent some 10 billion dlrs
this week to stabilize the dollar against the yen in the first
such test.
    "A massive attack on the mark, which could come if we get
bad news out of the U.S., Would require a much higher
intervention amount, raising the danger of inflation," he said.
    Turning to the international debt problem, Herrhausen said
Brazil's unilateral debt moratorium had surprised banks.
    But the move showed that a real solution to debt problems
was only possible with the involvement of all parties.

An international protocol to severely
limit the use of industrial chemicals which are believed to
damage the earth's protective ozone layer could be signed this
year, officials and scientists here said.
    "By the end of this year, we should have an international
protocol in place we can all be proud of," U.S. Environmental
protection agency officer Bill Long told reporters.
    The chemicals are chiefly chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) which
are used in refrigeration and making foam plastics, solvents
and aerosols. The earth's upper ozone layer absorbs most of the
harmful ultraviolet rays from the sun.
    The officials and scientists were meeting in Tokyo, ahead
of an international conference on the problem later this month
in either Vienna, or Geneva, Long said.
    Robert Watson, a program manager for atmospheric problems
at the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration said
a protocol should demand an initial freeze on the use of CFCs
by industry. This should be followed by a gradual reduction in
CFC volume until no CFC gases are released into the air, he
said. The U.S. Has already banned use of use CFCs in aerosols
and Japan has asked for voluntary restraint, but both still use
CFCs in industrial processes.

rates, further reducing the propects for a near term cut in
U.K. Bank base rates. The key three months interbank sterling

West German industrial production,
seasonally adjusted, rose a provisional 3.2 pct in February
after a downwards revised decline of 3.4 pct in January, the
Economics Ministry said.
    The ministry had originally estimated that industrial
production fell 3.0 pct in January.
    The February figure is likely to be revised upwards by just
under one percentage point next month when the March figure is
released, a ministry statement said.
    The industrial production index, base 1980, stood at a
provisional 104.1 in February against 100.9 in January and
104.5 in December. The ministry had previously put the January
and December indices at 101.6 and 104.7 respectively.
    In February 1986 the output index had stood at 103.7,
producing a year-on-year rise for February 1987 of 0.4 pct.
    The February rise in production was aided by a sharp 19 pct
increase in construction output compared with January, when
production in many industrial sectors was depressed by
unusually severe winter weather.
    Manufacturing industry registered a 3-1/2 pct rise in
production in February compared with January. But energy sector
output fell nine pct and mining production declined seven pct.
    The ministry, which considers two-monthly comparisons to be
a better guide to trends, said output in January and February
together fell around two pct against November and December.
    The ministry said construction output fell 13-1/2 pct in
January/February against November/December due to the cold
January weather. Output in the energy sector rose four pct and
mining output 10 pct.
    Manufacturing industry's production fell 1-1/2 pct in
January/February compared with November/December.
    Within this sector, the output of both basic products and
of food, tobacco and alcohol fell 1-1/2 pct. Production of
capital goods fell 2-1/2 pct while output of consumer goods was
unchanged.
    Compared with the same months of 1986, industrial
production in January and February 1987 fell 1-1/2 pct, the
ministry said.
    Manufacturing industry output fell one pct, with output of
basic products down three pct, capital goods down one pct and
food, tobacco and alcohol production 1-1/2 pct lower. Makers of
consumer goods posted a 1-1/2 pct year-on-year rise in the
two-month period.
    In other industrial sectors, mining production fell four
pct and construction output 4-1/2 pct. The energy sector saw a
slight 1/2 pct rise, the ministry added.

Interest rates on the London money market
were slightly firmer on news U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer

targets, 2.90 marks and 1.60 dlrs, to be promptly tested in the
foreign exchange markets. Sterling opened 0.3 points lower in
trade weighted terms at 71.3.
    Dealers noted the chancellor said he would achieve his
goals on sterling by a combination of intervention in currency
markets and interest rates.
    Operators feel the foreign exchanges are likely to test
sterling on the downside and that this seems to make a fall in
U.K. Base lending rates even less likely in the near term,
dealers said.
    The feeling remains in the market, however, that
fundamental factors have not really changed and that a rise in
U.K. Interest rates is not very likely. The market is expected
to continue at around these levels, reflecting the current 10
pct base rate level, for some time.
    The key three months interbank rate was 1/16 point firmer

Chemicals group Bayer
AG <BAYG.F> said it expects to post another good result in 1987
after raising pre-tax profit to a new record high in 1986.
    The company said that this was despite the mark's further
strengthening against the dollar and other currencies and
despite an increase in competitive pressure.
    "The further progress of our business will depend largely on
the extent to which threats to free trade materialise and on
the developments of exchange rates, raw material and energy
costs.
    Bayer said world group pre-tax profit rose to 3.30 billion
marks in 1986, exceeding the previous year's record of 3.15
billion. Parent company pre-tax profit increased to 1.72
billion from 1.62 billion.
    The company gave no net profit figures or any indication of
the likely 1986 dividend. Bayer paid a 10-mark dividend on 1985
results, up one mark from a year earlier.
    Bayer said that world group operating profit declined
slightly in 1986 against 1985 but non-operating results showed
a further improvement.
    Bayer said that the decline in world group turnover to
40.75 billion marks from 45.93 billion in 1985 reflected mainly
the sharp fall in the dollar against the mark.
    Lower prices on the raw material side had also brought
pressure on selling prices, it added.
    In volume terms, however, 1986 sales rose slightly against
1985, the company said without giving details.
    "The western Europe, North America and Far East regions
developed well in local currency, but here too the translation
of local currency sales into marks distorted the picture,
especially in the case of North America," it said.
    Bayer said parent company volume sales were also higher in
1986, although turnover fell 4.3 pct to 16.77 billion marks.
    Capacity use was high at the parent company in 1986,
resulting in a decline in marginal unit costs. This, combined
with savings in raw material and energy costs, helped offset
falling prices and cost increases in other areas.
    The rise in pre-tax parent company profit was due to lower
extraordinary expenses and higher net interest income.
Plastics, organic chemicals, polyurethanes and coating raw
materials all developed well, it said.
    Turning to the 1986 fourth quarter, Bayer said that world
group turnover fell to 9.67 billion marks in the last three
months of 1986 from 10.43 billion in the same 1985 period.
    Parent company turnover in the fourth quarter fell 7.1 pct
to 3.69 billion marks, with domestic turnover 4.1 pct lower and
foreign turnover 8.6 pct lower.
    Exports accounted for 65.3 pct of turnover in the quarter
against 66.4 pct in the same quarter of 1985.

Britain's gold and currency reserves
showed an underlying rise of 1.785 billion dlrs in March after
a 287 mln dlr rise in January, the Treasury said.
    This was considerably above market expectations for a 650
mln dlr rise.
    The underlying trend, which is a guide to Bank of England
operations to support the pound on foreign exchanges, is net of
borrowings and repayments.
    The Treasury declined comment on the figures. Last month it
said the Bank of England took the opportunity of strong demand
to rebuild reserves after losses last autumn.
    Actual reserves rose by 1.89 billion dlrs, after rising 305
mln in February, to 22.26 billion. Total reserves were revalued

currency holdings were revalued by 1.995 billion.
    Accruals of borrowings under the exchange cover scheme were
361 mln dlrs last month, after 36 mln in February. Repayments

should be amended if there was anything wrong with it.
    Officials were not immediately available for comment.
    Until now, Nakasone had vowed to press on with the tax as

breaks Nakasone general election campaign promises last July

Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
Lawson's remarks yesterday suggesting there are precise
exchange rate targets for the pound undermined sterling,
dashing hopes for an early cut in U.K. Base rates, analysts
said.
    But the market's reaction, testing exchange rate levels
indicated by Lawson, was probably overdone and the longer term
outlook for sterling remained bullish, they agreed.
    In an apparent break with the previous policy of secrecy,
Lawson told a National Economic Development Council meeting he
was comfortable with sterling exchange rates around current
levels, specifying rates of around 1.90 marks and 1.60 dlrs.
    Lawson added the U.K. Government intended to keep sterling
at about present levels, using currency intervention and
interest rates to achieve this.
    The February 22 Paris agreement of the Group of Five and
Canada to stabilise exchange rates is widely believed to
include target ranges, but all participants to the meeting had
so far refused to specify these.
    Markets were quick to react to the statement, chopping
about one U.S. Cent and over one pfennig off the pound to match
the levels mentioned by Lawson.
    But most analysts polled said they did not believe Lawson's
statement signalled a change in U.K. Policy.
    Keith Skeoch, chief economist at stockbrokers James Capel
and Co, said, "the remarks have been blown out of proportion.
Lawson is paying now for a little bit of a slip of the tongue."
    Barclays de Zoete Wedd economist Mark Brett said, "there is
nothing great and fantastic in the Chancellor's statement."
    He said he did not believe the rates indicated by the
Chancellor were precise targets, but merely represented central
rates around which sterling would be allowed to fluctuate,
perhaps by as much as 10 pct.
    "It would be insane to pinpoint an exchange rate ahead of an
election ... I don't believe Lawson is mad enough to tie
himself to a fixed rate," Brett said.
    Currency markets were keen for official statements to
clarify the scope of the Paris accord and reactivate currency
trading. This mood easily led to over-reaction, analysts said.
    "Making similar statements when the market is high strung
and ready to bounce is perhaps a mistake," one senior dealer
with a U.S. Bank said.
    Capel's Skeoch said, "it gives the foreign exchange markets
something to shoot at."
    "It is obvious that the government, as a member of the Group
of Six, has agreed exchange rate bands. But they are not cut in
stone, they can change with time," Skeoch said.
    Brett said, "we think the 2.90 marks level is a central
rate. Give or take 10 pfennigs and all is fine."
    Not all analysts played down the significance of the
remarks, however. Chris Dunn, economist at Royal Bank of
Canada, said the remarks may signal a decisive move to insulate
sterling from the fortunes of the dollar.
    Although about two-thirds of Britain's trade is conducted
with European countries, sterling has traditionally shadowed
the dollar rather than the mark, analysts noted.
    "Britain must decide whether it wants to follow the U.S. Or
throw in its lot with Europe," Dunn said.
    "It suggests that while the U.K. Is not actually applying to
join the European Monetary System, it is seeking protection by
shadowing it ... The Bundesbank has made it clear that it wants
the U.K. To clarify its position relative to the mark," he said.
    Analysts said sterling's dip on currency markets following
Lawson's remarks made an early half-point cut in U.K. Base
rates from current 10 pct levels unlikely in the short term.
    "Over the next three weeks, a cut is out, unless we get some
extremely good economic indicators," Capel's Skeoch said.
    Base rates have been cut twice by one-half point in March,
the last after the March 17 budget presentation, and analysts
had been expecting another half point cut shortly afterwards.

Ranks Hovis McDougall Plc <RHML.L> said
it was making an increased and final offer for the Avana Group
Plc <AVNA.L>. The company already holds about 22.9 pct or 7.1
mln Avana ordinary shares.
    It said in a statement the terms of the offer will be 13
new Rank Hovis shares for every five Avana ordinary shares,
valuing each Avana share at 829p.
    Avana shareholders will be entitled to receive and retain
the net interim dividend of 5.25p per Avana share for the year
ending 28 March 1987.
    Accepting Avana shareholders will also be entitled to
receive Ranks Hovis's forecast net interim dividend of 2.65p
for the financial year ending 5 September 1987.
    Ranks Hovis said that full acceptance of the increased
offer would result in the issue of a maximum of 72.3 mln new
Ranks Hovis shares or about 20 pct of the enlarged issued
ordinary share capital of the company.
    The latest offer will lapse on 17 April. Ordinary
shareholders in Avana who accept the increased offer will have
the opportunity to elect for cash for all or part of their
holdings on the basis of 800p cash for each Avana share.
    Ranks Hovis said the cash required for the cash alternative
would be met by one of several methods.
    For the first 10 mln Avana shares received opting for the
cash alternative, Ranks Hovis would make a cash payment from
its own resources.
    For cash alternatives of more than 10 mln Avana shares,
Morgan Grenfell, as agent for participants, will make a
separate offer to purchase at 300p per share, net of expenses,
up to 46.3 mln Ranks Hovis new shares to which such
shareholders will be entitled under the increased offer. This
is equivalent to 780p per Avana ordinary.
    In addition, Ranks Hovis will make a further cash payment
of 20p per Avana ordinary. Avana shares traded at 800p after
the announcement, 32p up from last night's close of 768p.

Japan's leading economic organisations
urged the Government to prepare drastic pump-priming measures
even at the cost of shelving Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's
planned tax reforms, officials involved said.
    Officials of the Federation of Economic Organisations
(Keidanren) said in a meeting with government officials the
Government should issue construction bonds as an emergency
measure to prop up the economy.
    Keidanren suggested that proceeds from sales of stocks in
the newly-privatised Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp should
also be used to stimulate the economy.
    Keidanren Chairman Eishiro Saito said the dollar's fall
below 150 yen would create huge unemployment and bankruptcies
that could shake the foundation of the Japanese economy.
    The Keidanren meeting coincided with a written request for
drastic reflationary measures sent to the Government by the
Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
    Both organisations called for stepped-up Bank of Japan
intervention to stabilise exchange rates.
    Chamber head Noboru Gotoh told a press conference the
awaited economic package should be powerful enough to push up
Japan's Gross National Product (GNP) by about two pct.
    Gotoh said the Government could cope with the present
critical economic condition even if it put off its plan to stop
the issue of deficit-covering bonds by fiscal 1990.
    The plan to reduce the fiscal budget is a pillar of
Nakasone's fiscal reconstruction program.

West German industrial production,
seasonally adjusted, rose a provisional 3.2 pct in February
after a downwards revised decline of 3.4 pct in January, the
Economics Ministry said.
    The ministry had originally estimated that industrial
production fell 3.0 pct in January.
    The February figure is likely to be revised upwards by just
under one percentage point next month when the March figure is
released, a ministry statement said.
    The industrial production index, base 1980, stood at a
provisional 104.1 in February against 100.9 in January and
104.5 in December. The ministry had previously put the January
and December indices at 101.6 and 104.7 respectively.
    In February 1986 the output index had stood at 103.7,
producing a year-on-year rise for February 1987 of 0.4 pct.
    The February rise in production was aided by a sharp 19 pct
increase in construction output compared with January, when
production in many industrial sectors was depressed by
unusually severe winter weather.
    Manufacturing industry registered a 3-1/2 pct rise in
production in February compared with January. But energy sector
output fell nine pct and mining production declined seven pct.
    The ministry, which considers two-monthly comparisons to be
a better guide to trends, said output in January and February
together fell around two pct against November and December.
    The ministry said construction output fell 13-1/2 pct in
January/February against November/December due to the cold
January weather. Output in the energy sector rose four pct and
mining output 10 pct.
    Manufacturing industry's production fell 1-1/2 pct in
January/February compared with November/December.
    Within this sector, the output of both basic products and
of food, tobacco and alcohol fell 1-1/2 pct. Production of
capital goods fell 2-1/2 pct while output of consumer goods was
unchanged.

French medium and long-term debt fell to
398.2 billion francs at end-1986 from 419.6 billion at
end-September and 464.7 billion at end-1985, the Finance
Ministry said.
    The 66.5 billion franc reduction over the full year mainly
reflected a 44.8 billion difference between debt redemption and
new foreign borrowings, it said.
    The 21.4 billion franc reduction in the fourth quarter
mainly reflected an 11.4 billion franc difference between
redemptions and new borrowing, the ministry added.
    The balance reflected revisions to the previous figures,
and the impact of the currency fluctuations on the French franc
value of foreign currency denominated borrowings, it said.
    Expressed in dollar terms, medium and long-term debt fell
to 62.7 billion dlrs at end-1986 from 63.4 billion at
end-September.
    The ministry said although the dollar's depreciation
favoured a reduction in foreign debt, this was largely offset
by the appreciation of other currencies in which 63 pct of
French medium and long term debts were denominated at end-1986.
    While the dollar remained the main borrowing currency,
accounting for 37 pct of medium and long-term debt, the mark
accounted for 11.5 pct, the European Currency Unit 10.8 pct,
the yen 9.4 pct, the Eurofranc 8.7 pct, the Swiss franc 7.3
pct, the Guilder 4.6 pct, sterling 3.7 pct and seven pct
others.
    Taking into account external lending, net foreign debt fell
to 81.5 billion francs at end-1986 from 106.7 billion at
end-September and 153.7 billion at end-1985.
    External lending, comprising export credits of more than
one year maturity, and public sector foreign loans, were
estimated at about 316.7 billion francs at end-1986 against
312.9 mln at end-September.
    Total foreign medium and long-term debt included seven
billion francs of direct state debt at end 1986, reduced from
15.6 billion three months earlier, the ministry said.

International Technology corp
said it expects to report a loss for the fourth quarter ended
March 31 of about 20 cts per share, compared with a
year-earlier profit of 11 cts.
    The company blamed the expected loss on regulatory and
permitting issues that limited the full utilization of
hazardous waste treatment cites in Califoirnia, continued
startup delays for major remediation projects, the writeoff of
an investment in a subsidiary and a settlem,ent with the
California Attorney General's Office and Department of Health
Services.
    The company said the settlement relates to regulatory
violations alleged by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agengy
and the California Health Services department at the company's
Vine Hill and Panoche treatment facilities in Northern
California.
    It said under the agreement, it will pay the state
2,100,000 dlrs in civil penalties over a two-year period and
pay 500,000 dlrs over five years to local medical facilities as
part of a community awareness and emergency response program
developed by local communities.  The expenses will be charged
against fourth quarter results, it said.
    The company said it has agreed as well to make compliance
and public safety capital expenditures of about 600,000 dlrs.
    It said it has now received an operating permit for a new
250,000 cubic yard landfill cell at its Imperial County,

expected to reopen for liquid and sludge receipts in the near

accounted for the majority of the revenue at the site, could be
restricted until 1988 pending resolution of capacity issues in

Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale
<WELG.F> said its wholly-owned Luxembourg subsidiary WestLB

mln marks from 48.5 mln a year earlier.
    WestLB International will pay a 12.5 mln mark dividend to
WestLB, down from 47.7 mln a year earlier.
    The dividend was lower than in 1985 because the record
profit of the previous year could not be repeated, due to
changed market conditions, it said. Increased funds were also
allocated for provisions. Business in the first three months of
1987 developed positively, it added.
    WestLB International set aside 115.3 mln marks for
international credit risks in 1986, up from 97.4 mln marks in
1985, bringing the total amount of provisions shown in the
balance sheet to 580.3 mln marks.
    Operating profit fell to 122 mln marks in 1986 from 150 mln
in 1985. Balance sheet total fell to 9.7 billion marks from
10.8 billion, reflecting the lower dollar and the fact that
credit business redemptions were not fully offset by new
lending.
    The statement said WestLB International's business with
private customers showed a pleasing expansion last year.
    This development was aided by cooperation between the bank
and the savings banks in the West German state of North
Rhine-Westphalia, where parent bank WestLB is based.
    Deposits by non-banks rose more than 40 pct to a total of

International Business Machines Corp
said it introduced four new personal computers, including a top
of the line unit based on the powerful Intel Corp <INTC> 80386
chip.
    The company said the new PC's are compatible with most
existing IBM PC applications.          
    The new computers, which mark the first major overhaul of
the IBM PC line since the company entered the business in 1981,
include a PC based on the Intel Corp <INTC> 80386
microprocessor, making it the most powerful IBM PC to date.
    Also included is an Intel 8086 based system which IBM said
is up to two and a half times as fast as its IBM PC XT model.
    IBM also introduced two new versions of its PC AT system.
These use an Intel 80286 chip running at 50 pct faster than the
existing IBM PC AT.
    The new line of PC's, which IBM calls the Personal
System/2, uses 3.5 inch diskettes instead of the conventional
5.25 inch diskettes.
    The company said the smaller diskettes store from two to
four times more data than larger diskette, which typically
handle 360 kilobytes of data.
    IBM said the new PC AT's and the 80386-based PC use a new
IBM-designed 32-bit data bus. This carries data internally
within the PC.
    The company said the new bus offers processing power up to
two to three-and-a-half times the existing IBM PC AT.
    IBM said the new PC's can run a new operating system,
called IBM DOS Version 3.3, which is now available.
    The company also said it will offer a second operating
system, called IBM Operating System/2, developed jointly with
Microsoft Corp <MSFT>. This will be available in stages,
beginning in the first quarter of 1988.
    IBM said Operating System/2 will for the first time give
IBM PC users the ability to access multiple applications and
very large programs and amounts of data.
    IBM said said its Personal System/2 Model 30, which is an
Intel 8-megahertz (MHz) 8086-based system, is now available at
a list price of 1,695 dlrs each with two diskette drives and
for 2,295 dlrs with one diskette and one 20-megabyte fixed disk
drive. The unit weighs 17 pounds.
    It said an 8087 math coprocessor that runs at the same
eight MHz rate as the 8086 is available.
    The company said the Personal System/2 Model 50, an Intel
10 MHz 80286-based desktop system, is now available at a cost
of 3,595 dlrs.
    IBM said said its Personal System/2 Model 60, which is also
an Intel 10 MHz 80286-based system, is a floor-standing system
available in two configurations. This system, which is
scheduled for availability in the second quarter, lists at
5,295 dlrs with a 44MB fixed disk drive and 6,295 dlrs on the
70MB fixed disk drive.
    The company said the Personal System/2 80 is the most
powerful member of the new family of PC's, using an Intel
80386-based mocroprocessor. The floor-standing machine will be
available in three configurations.
    IBM said one Model 80 configuration, scheduled for July
availability at a cost of 6,995 dlrs, runs at 16 MHz, contains

A partisan battle over President
Reagan's veto of an 88-billion dlr highway bill resumes in the
Senate today after an apparent victory for the White House was
left in doubt when a key Democrat switched his vote 
    The Senate yesterday had voted to sustain Reagan's veto by
a narrow margin, but Democrats moved to reconsider the vote.
Terry Sanford of North Carolina, the only Democrat to support
Reagan, later said he had decided to vote to override when the
bill is reconsidered.
    If no other votes switch, the Senate would override the
veto on reconsideration, Senate Republican leader Robert Dole
of Kansas said. He said Reagan and Administration officials
would continue to lobby for votes to sustain the veto.
    "As of right now, the vote would be 67 to 33 (in favor of
the bill) and the veto would be overriden," Dole said. 
    After several hours of delay, Senate leaders were unable to
agree on a time for a second vote and the Senate recessed until
this morning with the issue unresolved.
    Sanford denied he had been pressured to change his vote,
but told the Senate, "I have talked to and have been talked to
by a number of senators. I have thought a little more deeply
about this vote."
    The first Senate vote put Reagan on the verge of a
political triumph he had sought to show he is rebounding
strongly from the Iran arms scandal.

Officials at Toshiba <TSBA.T> told
reporters they have developed a kind of wire which can conduct
electricity with no resistance and therefore no loss of power.
    Although other firms have developed such superconductive
materials, Toshiba scientists said their discovery is the first
that allows the material to be formed into a pliable wire.
    Developing a superconducting material that works at room
temperature with no resistance is the object of a frenetic
worldwide scientific race. The main applications would be in
super powerful magnets, small computers of immense power and
speed, electric transmission lines which use negligible power,
and electric generators which consume no power.
    Toshiba said that it will probably be five years before it
can incorporate superconductors in marketable machines.
    But problems still have to be surmounted. Present
superconductors, including Toshiba's, need to be cooled to very
low temperatures before they can pass electricity with no
resistance. This requires costly liguid gas coolants.
    Superconductors developed to date transmit only small
currents and cannot conduct alternating current, only direct
current, government scientists said.
    Toshiba, which spent 190.3 billion yen on research and
development in the year ended March 31 1986, counts itself
among the leading superconductor research companies in Japan,
manager of Toshiba's public relations Yuji Wakayama said..
    The wires the company uses are a blend of yttrium, barium
and copper oxide and can conduct with no resistance at minus
179.5 degrees centigrade.

Mellon Bank Corp said it expects
to report a loss for the first quarter in the range of 55 mln
to 65 mln dlrs or 2.13 to 2.15 dlrs a share.
    The company also said it intends to reduce its second
quarter common stock dividend to 35 cts a share from 69 cts.
    Mellon said it will make a provision for loan losses in the
first quarter of 175 mln dlrs, reflecting about 95 mln dlrs in
charge-offs and 80 mln dlrs in additions to the loan-loss
reserve.
    It will also put 310 mln dlrs in Brazilian loans on a cash
basis, resulting in interest reversals of 10 mln dlrs.
    In the first quarter of 1986, Mellon earned 60.4 mln dlrs
or 2.13 dlrs a share.
    Chairman David Barnes said the loan charge-offs and
increased provisions address four areas of concern in the
bank's wholesale lending portfolio - the energy sector,
developing countries, some basic industrial companies and
several commercial real estate businesses.
    Mellon said the loan loss reserve at the end of the first
quarter is estimated to be 575 mln dlrs, or about 2.5 pct of
the loan book, compared with 493.8 mln dlrs or 2.17 pct of
total loans at the end of 1986.
    Mellon said its primary capital ratio at the end of the
first quarter will be in line with the end-1986 figure of 7.23
pct, well in excess of regulatory guidelines.
    Non-performing loans at quarter-end are estimated at 1.45
billion dlrs, or 6.5 pct of the loan portfolio, compared with
928 mln dlrs or 3.94 pct at the end of 1986.
    Barnes noted that Mellon has a bigger involvement in
energy-based lending than many other banks. Because of the lack
of a substantial recovery in energy prices this year,
especially in natural gas prices, it was felt prudent to
increase reserves and take losses on loans in this sector.
    "This action relates both to loans to companies directly
involved in energy, as well as loans to real estate developers,
home builders and financial institutions in the Southwestern
United States," Barnes said.
    As for LDC loans, he said Mellon had removed about 80 mln
dlrs in fully current Argentine loans from cash basis but had
charged off about 20 mln dlrs in private-sector Mexican debt.
    He said Mellon, which was ordered in December to quit
Brazil because of its refusal to renew some short-term credit
lines, expects to participate in efforts to helpt Brazil and
other sovereign borrowers to reschedule their debts.
    Loans to basic industries were not major contributors to
the increase in non-performing assets or to first-quarter
charge offs, but Mellon said it remains concerned about the
absence of a strong recovery in steel and related industries.
    The increase in reserves, the dividend cut and continued
management cost-cutting are aimed at ensuring that Mellon has
the financial strength to deal with current uncertainties,
Barnes said.
    "We cannot predict when the uncertainties that presently
trouble us will end, but we are confident we are managing them
aggressively," he added.

Eli Lilly and Co said its board
approved a plan to buy up to 2.3 mln shares of its common stock
to offset dilution from conversion of its 10-year notes issued
in connection with the acquisition of Hybritech Inc in March
1986.
    The non-transferable notes pay interest at an annual rate
of 6.75 pct. The notes, which mature on March 31, 1996, became
convertible into 2.3 mln shares of Lilly stock at 66.31 dlrs a
share beginning March 18, 1987.
    Lilly said it will buy shares of stock from time to time in
the open market at prevailing prices or in privately negotiated
transactions.
    The newly announced purchase plan is in addition to its
existing anti-dilutive stock repurchase programs. Under these
programs, the company systematically buys back shares in the
open market to replace shares issued under its stock plan and
acquisition earnout agreements.
    Currently the only other potentially diluting instruments
are the warrants that the company also issued in connection
with the Hybritech acquisition.
    Lilly issued 17.1 mln warrants with an expiration of March
31, 1991. A warrant gives the holder the right to purchase one
share of Lilly common at 75.98 dlrs. Since the acquisition,
Lilly has repurchased 2.0 mln warrants, so there are currently
15.1 mln outstanding.
    The warrants are publicly traded on the New York Stock
Exchange.
    Because of the theoretical size of the dilution resulting
from the outstanding warrants, warrants convertible notes,
stock plan and acquisition earnout agreements, the company said
it will be required to report earnings per share on a fully
diluted basis beginnng with the first quarter of 1987.
    At the end of February, Lilly had 139.6 mln shares
outstanding.

Several industrial nations are
pressing the United States to consider whether its debt
strategy, under increasing fire in the developing world, needs
to be strengthened, monetary sources say.
    While few nations are ready to pour vast sums of money into
radical "debt relief" style solutions to the debt crisis,
pressure is building for a greater International Monetary Fund
role in the plan.
    But U.S. officials, who are fighting off demands for change
by Congress, are confident they will retain support for their
strategy which will probably be endorsed in a communique
issued by the IMF's policy-making Interim Committee.
    One Reagan administration official said a recent discussion
among leading industrial countries showed there was "very broad
and strong support for continuing the strategy".
    The official said in an interview, "I don't sense that
there's a strong desire to revise the debt strategy, except of
course here on (Capitol) Hill."
    But monetary sources said some industrial nations, like
France and Italy, are troubled by signs the strategy is
increasingly strained. Britain too is said to be concerned.
    In late 1985, Washington called on multilateral development
banks, like the World Bank, and commercial banks to increase
loans to the 15 major debtors by 29 billion dlrs over three
years.
    In return, the major debtors were expected to undertake
reforms promoting inflation-free economic growth, more open
markets and a reduced government role in the economy.
    The IMF was to retain a "central role" in the strategy,
shifting its economic reform programs from emphasizing
austerity to stressing growth, freer trade policies and foreign
investment in debtor nations.
    But monetary sources said some nations want even more
flexibility from the IMF when it sets economic programs tied to
loans for debtor nations.
    Such flexibility would include less rigid economic targets
-- which often lead to artificial crises when they are not met
-- and more reliance on ranges and benchmarks to monitor
economic performance.
    There is also concern that the level of IMF lending is too
low and the commercial banks, themselves under attack for
tawdry loan levels to debtors, want to see it increased.
    The IMF, which holds its semi-annual meetings with the
World Bank next week, will only be a small net lender this
year. Much of its loan disbursements are offset by repayments.
    Meanwhile, most countries, including the United States,
acknowledge the banks have not lived up to their commitments.
    Paul Volcker, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, is 
particularly irritated with the reluctance of commercial banks
to lend more to reforming debtors, monetary sources say.
    New IMF managing director Michel Camdessus is understood to
be worried about the Fund's image in the developing world,
where it is often depicted as the source of economic ills.
    Camdessus' experience as former chairman of the so-called
"Paris Club" of western creditor governments, has given him
extensive first-hand experience of the debt crisis.
    Brazil, which in February declared an interest paymernts
moratorium on 67 billion dlrs of commercial bank debt, has
flatly ruled out adopting a program of IMF-sponsored economic
reforms. Peru too has rejected an IMF program, curbing debt
repayments to 10 pct of exports.
    But the administration official said Brazil's strategy of
using a moratorium as a negotiating tool might backfire. "It's
probably turning out to be more complicated than they thought.
It underlines the extreme risk that a debtor country takes on
itself when it begins down that road," the official said.
    Indeed, U.S. banks are laying the groundwork for writing
down their Brazilian loans.
    U.S. officials have generally praised most debtors for
adopting genuine economic reforms and the multilateral
institutions for stepping up their lending.
    And they point out that Venezuela, Chile and the
Philippines have struck agreement with commercial banks
stretching out debt repayments.
    But problems still dog assembly of a 7.7 billion dlrs bank
loan for Mexico, which many officials acknowledge may be the
last major cash loan for a debtor country.
    Instead, banks are being pressed to come up with more novel
ways of easing the liquidity squeeze in debtor nations.
    The prospect of greater official involvement in the debt
strategy depends chiefly on the ability of western nations to
come up with more finance.
    While there is sympathy in Congress for various forms of
debt relief, more U.S. funds for the World Bank or the IMF are
a virtual impossibility in today's era of budget restraint.
    That leaves rich surplus nations like Japan and West
Germany, but neither country favors generalized debt relief.
    And the Reagan administration is not inclined to bow to
Congressional pressure for changes in regulations governing
foreign loans, to make it easier for banks to account for
delays in interest and principal repayments.

The European Community responded to
widespread U.S. criticism of its trade policies by publishing
an extensive list of U.S. actions which pose obstacles to EC
exports.
    A spokeswoman for the EC Commission said the detailed
25-page report of alleged malpractices was in response to a
similar document issued by U.S. Administration officials in
November, and updated a previous EC list.
    EC External Trade Relations Commissioner Willy De Clercq
said its object was to show such actions were not solely taken
by trading partners of the U.S. And that "the U.S. Were not
innocents in the matter."
    The report covers the entire field of EC-U.S. Commercial
relations and lists more than 30 obstacles ranging from tariff
measures, import quotas, customs duties, anti-dumping
procedures, fiscal barriers and export subsidies.
    The Commission said not all the barriers mentioned were
necessarily inconsistent with U.S. International obligations,
and emphasised many of them could be removed at upcoming
international trade talks. "The purpose of the report is to make
clear that trade practices which impede exports are not a
unique problem only faced by U.S. Exporters. Europeans face
similar problems in the U.S.," it said.
    Among the obstacles detailed in the report are import
restrictions on food products, such as cheese, sugar and syrup,
certain wines, beers and juices, as well as on firearms and
machine tools.
    It also criticises programs to boost U.S. Cereals exports.
The document said the U.S.'s three-year export enhancement
program (EEP), which began in 1985, had subsidised exports of
9.7 mln tonnes of wheat, two mln tonnes of wheat flour and 2.8
mln tonnes of barley up to mid-March this year. The subsidies
granted so far were worth about 620 mln dlrs, it added.
    "The Community has already reacted where necessary to U.S.
EEP subsidies by increasing its exports refunds, and will
continue to do so," it said, adding the current GATT round would
also provide an opportunity to address the subject.
    The document also says import quotas maintained by the U.S.
On a range of farm products, including sugar, peanuts and
certain cottons, restrict EC exports.
    In addition, the report deplores a recent U.S.-Japan accord
on semi-conductors, export controls on technology transfers,
standards tests in the telecommunications arena and the U.S.
Administration's "buy American" public procurement policy.

Japanese press reports said Prime Minister
Yasuhiro Nakasone has said he may compromise on his
controversial sales tax plan, bowing to widespread opposition
even within his own party.
    The reports said he told a meeting of supporters of his
ruling Liberal Democratic Party today the proposed five pct tax
should be amended if there was anything wrong with it.
    Officials were not immediately available for comment.
    Until now, Nakasone had vowed to press on with the tax as
part of his plan to reform Japan's 36-year-old tax system.
    But most Japanese newspapers and news agencies quoted him
as saying today he would not foist the tax on the Japanese
people if they hated it.
    Opposition parties and some industry groups say the tax
breaks Nakasone general election campaign promises last July
and would discourage consumer spending, needed to meet
government pledges to try to stimulate economic growth.
    Pressure for the tax to be amended or shelved is likely to
increase soon, before a first round of local elections due on
April 12, political analysts said. Resistance has spread from
opposition parties and affected industries to the LDP.
    Some 36 of Japan's 47 provincial governments have called
for the plan to be scrapped or handled carefully, government
officials said.
    Some leading LDP candidates for the local polls have not
asked Nakasone to make a campaign speech for them as they fear
his presence would weaken their position in the elections.

U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard
Lyng, reacting to recent criticism of U.S. meat inspection,
defended the program saying the United States has the best
inspection system in the world.
    Speaking to representatives of the U.S. National
Cattlemen's Association, NCA, Lyng attacked what he called
recent "terribly biased" press reports critical of USDA poultry
inspection. He cited a report on CBS "60 Minutes" which
criticized USDA salmonella detection in poultry.
    "I know we have the finest meat and poultry inspection
system in the world," Lyng told the cattlemen.
    Lyng said USDA makes every effort to minimize the levels of
salmonella in poultry, but added "the total elimination of
harmful bacteria is virtually impossible in this world."

Duff and Phelps put the outstanding
fixed income securities of of Standard Oil Co on its watch list
following the tentative offer by British Petroleum of North
America <BP> to buy the company.
    Standard Oil's nearly three billion dlrs of long-term debt
is currently rated DP-5 (high A) by the ratings agency.
    British Petroleum currently owns about 55 pct of Standard
Oil's outstanding common stock and to acquire the remainder at
the tender offer price of 70 dlrs per share would cost 7.4
billion dlrs.
    British Petroleum intends to fund two-thirds of that
purchase with borrowed funds and the rest with cash.
    The additional debt will raise the fixed obligation ratio
of British Petroleum from under 30 pct to perhaps 45 pct and
increase its debt service requirements, Duff and Phelps said.
    However, putting Standard Oil's debt on its watch list,
which Duff and Phelps said had "potentially negative
implications," may eventually result in an upgrade depending on
how British Petroleum restructures the company, Howard Mount of
the ratings agency said.
    Mount said that acquiring Standard Oil's substantial cash
flows and eliminating the annual dividend, which totaled 305
mln dlrs to common shareholders in 1986, would help satisfy
British Petroleum's higher debt service.

Coffee prices look set to continue
sliding in the near term, given the lack of progress towards a
new International Coffee Organization (ICO) export quota
accord, according to coffee traders and analysts.
    Robusta coffee futures dipped sharply to 4-1/2 year lows
yesterday at 1,220 stg per tonne, basis the May position, when
the lack of new debate on quotas at ICO talks here confirmed
expectations that efforts to restore quotas would not be
revived at this stage, they said.
    The 15-day ICO average composite price fell to 99.69 cents
a lb for April 1, the lowest for 5-1/2 years.
    Quotas will not now be renegotiated before the ICO's annual
September council session, and in the interim the Brazilian
frost season from June to August may prove the only bullish
factor to stem further price weakness, they said. Futures
bounced back from the lows today towards the previous trading
range around 1,260/1,270 stg per tonne on May as the market
recovered from yesterday's "confidence blip," one trader
commented.
    But despite today's upturn, the overall trend is for lower
prices in the near future, one trade source said.
    The market had become increasingly vulnerable to
yesterday's shakeout, having held within a 1,250/1,350 stg
second position trading range for 22 successive sessions, he
said.
    Technically the market is more likely to decline further as
it absorbs today's brief rally. Steep declines towards the
1,100/1,050 stg area could foster a "three figure mentality," and
speculators may elect to push for coffee prices below the
psychological 1,000 stg level, he added.
    Some traders said today's upturn was in part due to
Brazil's opening last night of May green coffee export
registrations.
     This had been widely anticipated by the market and came as
no surprise, but it did remove some prevailing uncertainty and
light trade buying was seen this morning as a consequence.
    However, the overall trend remains downwards and a test of
support at 1,200 stg should be expected soon, with the only
possible supportive influence on the horizon being the approach
of Brazil's frost season, they said.
    Roasters are believed to be well covered, limiting
activities to modest hand-to-mouth purchases and generally not
taking up producer offers, they added.
    Central American producers have sold the bulk of their
current crops, but robusta producers in West Africa and
Indonesia need to sell coffee for April through July shipment,
and this could pressure prices further, traders said.
    However, one dealer, although seeing no reason to be
bullish, advised caution. "Everybody's bearish now, just as they
were bullish when the market was at 3,100 stg," he said.
    Arthur Cherry, coffee analyst at E.D. and F. Man, expressed
doubts the price spiral would continue much below current
levels. "One dlr coffee is catastrophic for many producers --
there must be a minimum below which prices cannot fall."
    While prices dropped to the lowest levels since September
1982 yesterday, manufacturers have no plans to cut their retail
prices.
    "Its impossible to say, we can't predict anything like that
at this stage," a General Foods spokesman said.
    Manufacturers have lowered prices recently anyway in
response to market weakness. At the beginning of March the
price of a 100 gram jar of coffee was cut to 1.55 stg from 1.65
stg in Britain. But should coffee market prices continue to
fall, the situation would be reviewed, the spokesman added.
    Nestle also has no plans to make additional price cuts in
the near future.
    "The market seems to have established some equilibrium and
doesn't look set to go much lower," a Nestle spokesman
commented.
    Coffee's plunge this week has been mirrored by tea, which
fell to a 5-1/2 year low at today's auction at 1.18 stg per
kilo for medium quality, traders added.

options on heating oil futures will begin trading June 26.
    This would be the second options contract to trade at the
exchange. NYMEX introduced crude oil options last November.
    "Heating oil options are a logical complement to our
existing energy complex," said NYMEX Chairman William Bradt.
    "From our experience in crude, we fully expect heating oil
options to offer significant new trading opportunities to
current market participants and also draw additional users into
this marketplace," he said.
    Six consecutive trading months in heating oil options will
be introduced on June 26, led by the September 1987 contract,
according to the exchange.
    Strike prices wil be in increments of two cts per gallon
and seven strike prices for puts and for calls will be
available, the exchange said. The middle strike price will
correspond closely to the settlement price of the previous
day's futures close, it said.
    Expiration will be on the second Friday of the month
preceding delivery of the underlying futures contract, it said,
meaning that the September options contract would expire August
14.
    Prices for heating oil options will be quoted in cts per
gallon with a minimum fluctuation of 0.01 cent per gallon,
NYMEX said.
    The options will be based on the underlying futures
contract of 42,000 gallons each. Trading hours will be the same
as heating oil futures, beginning at 0950 EST and ending 1505

Sterling made a sharp recovery when U.K.
Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson described remarks he
made yesterday on targets for the pound as "insignificant,"
rallying back up almost exactly to the levels it had fetched
before Lawson spoke yesterday, dealers and analysts said.
    They said sterling would likely leave the limelight once
again to trade quietly around current levels, as the markets
set their sights on the dollar, yen and mark again ahead of key
international monetary talks in Washington next week.
    Sterling ended its European day at 1.6020/30 dlrs,
virtually unchanged from yesterday's last 1.6040/50 dlrs,
fetched before Lawson's first comment. But it was well up on
levels just above 1.59 dlrs which it had held until the second
comment came.
    Against the mark, sterling recovered to close at
2.9190/9240 marks after today's opening 2.9040/90 and last
night's 2.9210/45.
    "On balance, it is as if nothing happened ... We are back to
where we were before," Mark Brett, economist at securities house
Barclays de Zoete Wedd said.
    "This whole story is like a storm in a teacup," a dealer with
a U.K. Bank commented.
    The pound's recovery was triggered when Lawson criticised
media coverage of comments he made yesterday, when he told a
conference he wanted sterling to stay roughly where it was.
    In this context, Lawson was reported to have specified
rates of around 2.90 marks and 1.60 dlrs to the pound in
remarks which markets were quick to interpret as a signal to
sell sterling.
    Lawson said today he had merely stated yesterday's
approximate value of the pound.
    "The wrong end of the stick was picked up," he told
reporters, adding his comments did in no way signal a change in
British exchange rate policies.
    Dealers and analysts said the reactions to both statements
were clear evidence that the market, frustrated by the relative
currency stability after the February 22 Paris agreement, was
desperate to reactivate trading and would react to any clues
offered about the contents of the currency accord.
    In Paris, finance ministers of the Group of Five and Canada
are widely believed to have agreed exchange rate targets,
although no participant has specified these in an apparent bid
to foster stability by keeping markets guessing.
    "The markets are absolutely desperate to get clues on Group
of Six (countries that are part to the Paris agreement) targets
... The number of rumours flying around is bigger than ever
before," said Barclays de Zoete Wedd's Brett.
    Analysts said neither yesterday's remarks nor today's had
changed their impression that after Paris, sterling was
targeted to trade in broad ranges against major currencies.
     All polled analysts said if anything, the 2.90 marks level
mentioned by Lawson was probably the centre of a wide
20-pfennig range which sterling would easily hold, helped by
good economic indicators and relatively high interest rates.
    "It would be insane to pinpoint an exchange rate ahead of an
election ... I don't believe Lawson is mad enough to tie
himself to a fixed rate," Brett said. He expected sterling to
firm over the next few weeks, to around 2.95 marks and 1.63
dlrs, as overseas investors reappraised high-yielding
investments here.
    Robin Marshall, chief economist at Chase Manhattan
Securities, said he was not surprised to see Lawson qualify his
sterling target comments so quickly.
    "His remarks gave markets a target to aim at," he said,
adding, "He (Lawson) talked himself into a bit of a corner on
this ... It made him a hostage to fortune."
    Marshall and other analysts dismissed a theory, that by
quoting target rates Lawson had attempted to put pressure on
prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to agree to British membership
of the European Monetary System (EMS), as implausible.

Amoco Corp first quarter profits are
expected to exceed the 165 mln dlrs, or 65 cts per share,
reported for 1986's fourth quarter, chairman Richard Morrow
said.
    Speaking to reporters after a security analyst meeting, he
said the gain was expected because of higher oil and gas
prices, but declined to compare his expectations with the 331
mln dlrs, or 1.28 dlrs per share, the company earned in 1986's
first quarter.
    Earlier, Morrow told the analysts that Amoco's first
quarter refining and marketing results "will look pretty poor,"
because of low margins in January and February. The margins
began to improve last month and look pretty good now, he added.
    Morrow said he expects oil product margins to remain good
for the rest of the year, "but it remains to be seen if they
will match 1986 levels." The Amoco chairman said he expects
crude oil prices to remain in the 17 to 20 dlr barrel range for
the rest of 1988 based on his belief that OPEC's agreement will
hold.
    Morrow said his best estimate for 1989 crude oil prices is
21 dlrs per barrel, adding he believes this price level would
result in a 40 pct increase in oil company exploration
spending.
    President H. Lawrance Fuller told the analysts Amoco
reduced its estimates of worldwide oil and gas reserves by a
total of 201 mln equivalent barrels last year because of a drop
in oil and gas prices.
    Noting the Securities and Exchange Commission requires that
reserves be estimated on the assumption that year-end prices
will remain fixed for the life of the properties, he said the
drop in oil prices to 16 dlrs a barrel at the end of 1986 from
27 dlrs a year earlier forced the company to reduce its reserve
estimate by four pct.
    Fuller said Amoco expects its U.S. oil and natural gas
liquids production to decline about five pct this year from
last year's 121 mln barrels because of drilling deferrals made
last year when oil prices were falling.
    He said the full impact of the deferrals was off-set by the
purchase of properties which will add about 5,000 barrels per
day to the company's 1987 U.S. production.
    Fuller said U.S. refining capacity is expected to be
increasingly strained by the rising demand for lead-free
gasoline, especially the higher octane grades.
    He said expected federal regulations on gasoline vapor
pressure will further tighten the industry's gasoline
production capacity.

There is little scope for a substantial
increase in U.S. interest rates during 1987, said Federal
National Mortgage Association chairman David Maxwell.
    Speaking to the New York Financial Writers' Association,
Maxwell said he viewed this week's rise in U.S. banks' prime 
rates to 7-3/4 pct from 7-1/2 pct as a temporary phenomenon.
    "I don't see a substantial rise in rates this year. If
anything, the Federal Reserve is more likely to ease than to
tighten (monetary policy) because so many sectors of the
economy are showing weakness," Maxwell said. Fannie Mae buys
mortgages from lenders and issues mortgage-backed securities.
    Maxwell said restructuring of Fannie Mae over the last two
years had limited its exposure to interest rate fluctuations. A
one pct rise in rates in 1987 would cost shareholders about 18
cts a share versus one dlr a share in 1981, he said.
    Maxwell also questioned the view that housing crowds out
other sectors of the economy from obtaining needed capital.
    "There's no evidence that housing is crowding firms out of
the long-term debt market," he said. Both home mortgage debt
and long-term corporate debt grew at about equal annual rates
of about 13 pct in 1986 -- a year when mortgage originations of
442 billion dlrs needed record housing capital, he said.

Shoppers who buy Haagen-Daas ice cream,
Dijon mustard or Tuborg beer on their weekly trip to the
supermarket are soon to be the target of a promotional blitz
for national-brand "gourmet" coffees.
    General Foods, the largest U.S. coffee roaster, and A and
P, which shares the third place in the U.S. market, are the
only two national brand roasters so far to introduce the
higher-quality coffees into selected supermarkets.
    But industry insiders believe there is substantial growth
potential in upscale coffee, despite years of flat sales in
regular ground roast types.
    "I would suspect General Foods will make a name for
themselves with their gourmet line," said a coffee trade
source. "What it could do is really dent the small-store,
whole-bean business," the trade source added.
    The new lines are designed to appeal to a classic
advertising composite--the "yuppie" consumer.
    They buy fresh pasta, subscribe to Bon Appetit magazine and
were "first on their block with a wok," as described by Karin
Brown, General Foods senior product manager for its new coffee,
called Private Collection out of GF's Maxwell House division.
    Paul Gallant, president of A and P's Compass Foods
subsidiary that makes the new A and P gourmet line, described
its potential appeal as "a status thing."
    At an initial price of 4.99 dlrs for 12 ounces it is
expensive, though not more so than high quality coffee sold in
small specialty stores. General Foods' Maxwell House Div. has
just cut the price on its new offering by 50 cents to 4.49 dlrs
for 12 ounces--a move competitor A and P is bound to imitate,
according to an A and P executive.
    Number two U.S. roaster Folgers has "nothing to announce at
this point" in the gourmet line, a spokesman said. Neither does
Hills Bros., a subsidiary of Nestle that shares the third and
fourth size market spot by volume with A and P.
    Competitors believe Folgers will watch the progress of
General Foods' offering, prepared to jump in if the market
takes off.
    General Foods and A and P hope their new products will help
push coffee sales out of the doldrums. Coffee consumption in
the United States has fallen 44 pct since 1962, according to a
1986 study by the International Coffee Organization. Sales show
no signs of picking up.
    Compass's Gallant blames the falloff on declines in coffee
quality since the 1960's and aggressive soft drink marketing.
    "The national brands began to cheapen the blend in the name
of profit but spent 100 mln dlrs a year telling consumers this
was quality coffee," Gallant said.
    As a result, first time consumers never got a taste for the
brew. The first time a young consumer tries coffee, "they turn
around and say 'My God this is awful, I think I'll have a
Coke'," he said.
    Having now mostly written off the 16-25 age group, who have
confirmed their loyalty to soft drinks, coffee marketers are
aiming at the high income, free-spending, self-treating crowd
-- the yuppie composite.
    "Where else are you going to go?," an industry source said.
"Kids aren't going to drink coffee, that's apparent. There are
no other markets. The only area that's not been promoted is
gourmet," he said.
    In addition to perking up sales, success in the gourmet
line could provide much higher margins to roasters than regular
ground roast coffees produce.
    Generally, retail prices are about twice the price of
green, unroasted coffee beans, taking into account the costs of
roasting, packaging and distribution, and then deducting
often-generous trade discounts. Supermarkets tend to sell
coffee near the trade price as a "loss leader," a product
designed to draw shoppers into the store.
    But with the new gourmet lines, a different pricing
structure prevails, industry sources said. There is no trade
discounting and an emphasis on expensive packaging, including a
special valve designed to keep the beans fresher.
    Dealers said roasters were buying the higher quality green
beans at about 1.60 dlrs a lb. Thus, retail prices on gourmet
coffee are now almost three times the price of green.
    Targetted consumers seem willing to pay the difference.
General Foods claims 80 pct of consumers in their test market
surveys for Private Collection came back for more.
    And product manager Brown points to the success of more
expensive beers, mustard and ice cream, that began selling in
restricted high income areas and are now available in almost
every supermarket in the country.
    A and P is similarly optimistic. "We think we'll do
extremely well in the gourmet market," Gallant said.
    Maxwell House is marketing its eight types of Private
Collection in selected high income areas, while A and P offers
its 14 different whole bean gourmet coffees, called 8 O'Clock
Royale, only in their own stores in Philadelphia, Baltimore,
New York, Atlanta and some other metropolitan areas.

Sharp cuts this year in U.S. planted
acreage may not make a big dent in the U.S. grain stockpile but
will at least keep grain surpluses from increasing, Agriculture
Department and industry commodity analysts said.
    "The scenario is turning around on stocks. The whole
supply/demand picture could finally be getting more in
balance," a USDA analyst said.
    The USDA prospective plantings report this week indicated
that U.S. farmers will idle 52 to 55 mln acres in annual
acreage reduction programs this year. An additional 20 mln
acres have been enrolled in the conservation reserve program,
bringing total idled acreage in the U.S. to 72-75 mln acres,
almost a third of the nation's total 235 mln acre crop base.
    Production of wheat, corn and soybeans in 1986/87 will
probably closely match annual usage, limiting any buildup in
stocks, analysts said.
    "It's a substantially different story from last year when
we added 1.5 billion bushels of corn to the stockpile," Vernon
McMinimy, director of commodity research for Staley Co. said.
    Interviewed at an agribusiness education conference here,
McMinimy said that 67.6 mln planted acres of corn will likely
translate into 60 mln harvested acres, and with normal yields,
final production of 6.9 to 7.0 billion bushels.
    McMinimy estimated that total U.S. corn disappearance in
1986/87 could end up at 7.1 billion bushels, possibly resulting
in a 200-million bushel reduction in the current corn stockpile
of 5.45 billion bushels.
    "To say this represents a turn-around is wrong, but we're
at least in a holding pattern," George Hoffman, director of
commodity analysis for Pillsbury said.
    Hoffman said wheat stocks could rise slightly by the end of
1986/87 to 1.9 billion bushels due to "significantly less"
domestic feed use for wheat because of lower corn prices.
    USDA analysts, however, project slightly higher usage and
said wheat stocks will either decrease slightly or at least not
increase. With yearly use at around two billion bushels, next
year's projected crop could be used up, an analyst said.
    "We won't be adding to stocks. Stocks are at a record now,
so if we can begin to touch them even minutely through acreage
reductions, that would be an improvement," an Agriculture
Department wheat analyst said.
    Soybean planted acreage, at 56.9 mln acres, would be the
smallest planted soybean acreage since 1976 and could lower
final production by 150 mln bushels and ending stocks by 50 to
100 mln bushels, analysts said.
    As more marginal, erodable acreage is enrolled in the
conservation reserve program, annual acreage reduction programs
will be more effective because they will force more high
producing land out of production, a USDA analyst said.
    "We can now maybe see the light at the end of a very long
tunnel," the analyst said.

Changes by the USDA in its posted county
prices have successfully increased PIK-and-roll activity as a
way to pull corn out of government stockpiles, with the
resulting jump in free supplies pressuring terminal corn basis
values, cash grain dealers said.
    Processors dropped spot Chicago corn basis bids three cents
after covering most of the April needs this week, with river
corn basis bids following CIF Gulf corn values lower.
    The surge in PIK-and-roll also pressured corn futures, with
May settling today down three cents per bushel at 1.58-1/2
dlrs, near the contract low of 1.49-1/4 dlrs. But unlike in the
past when lower prices slowed country movement, now lower
county prices widen the differentials with the corn loan and
make PIK-and-roll even more attractive, they noted.

Sharp cuts this year in U.S. planted
acreage may not make a big dent in the U.S. grain stockpile but
will at least keep grain surpluses from increasing, Agriculture
Department and industry commodity analysts said.
    "The scenario is turning around on stocks. The whole
supply/demand picture could finally be getting more in
balance," a USDA analyst said.
    The USDA prospective plantings report this week indicated
that U.S. farmers will idle 52-55 mln acres in annual acreage
reduction programs this year. An additional 20 mln acres have
been enrolled in the conservation reserve program, bringing
total idled acreage in the U.S. to 72-75 mln acres, almost a
third of the nation's total 235 mln acre crop base.
    Production of wheat, corn and soybeans in 1986/87 will
probably closely match annual usage, limiting any buildup in
stocks, analysts said.
    "It's a substantially different story from last year when
we added 1.5 billion bushels of corn to the stockpile," Vernon
McMinimy, director of commodity research for Staley Co. said.
    Interviewed at an agribusiness education conference here,
McMinimy said that 67.6 mln planted acres of corn will likely
translate into 60 mln harvested acres, and with normal yields,
final production of 6.9 to 7.0 billion bushels.
    McMinimy estimated that total U.S. corn disappearance in
1986/87 could end up at 7.1 billion bushels, possibly resulting
in a 200-million bushel reduction in the current corn stockpile
of 5.45 billion bushels.
    "To say this represents a turn-around is wrong, but we're
at least in a holding pattern," George Hoffman, director of
commodity analysis for Pillsbury said.
    Hoffman said wheat stocks could rise slightly by the end of
1986/87 to 1.9 billion bushels due to "significantly less"

West German unemployment, unadjusted
for seasonal factors, fell to 2.41 mln in March from 2.49 mln
in February, the Federal Labour Office said.
    The total represents 9.6 pct of the workforce compared with
10.0 pct in February.
    The seasonally adjusted jobless total rose, however, in
March to 2.23 mln from 2.18 mln in February, it added.
    In March last year the unadjusted unemployment total stood
at 2.45 mln and represented 9.8 pct of the workforce.
Seasonally adjusted unemployment was 2.29 mln.
    The Federal Labour Office said the number of workers on
short time rose by 80,629 to 462,802 and the number of
vacancies increased by 15,263 to 180,047.
    Labour Office President Heinrich Franke, announcing the
figures, said the hesitant decline in the unadjusted jobless
total reflected continuing bad weather, slack activity in the
capital goods sector and structural changes in the coal and
steel industry.
    In a separate statement, the Federal Statistics Office said
the rise in the overall number of people in employment had
slowed in February.
    The Office said that, according to estimates for February,
25.7 mln people were in work, a rise of around 240,000 or 0.9
pct compared with the same month in 1986.
    It noted that in January the year-on-year rise was 250,000

Japan should increase foreign access to
its farm products market, while encouraging further development
of domestic agriculture, a government report said.
    The white paper on agriculture for the year ended March 31
said active participation in writing world farm trade rules at
the next round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)
talks will help prepare Japan to improve access.
    Agriculture Ministry sources said the paper marked an
easing in Japan's tough position on agricultural imports which
stressed the need for strict controls on some products to
maintain self-sufficiency in food.
    Japan now produces only 30 pct of its annual grain needs,
down from 61 pct some 20 years ago, official figures show.
    The paper said Japanese agriculture has been slow to
improve productivity and demand/supply imbalances.
    The relative shortage of farmland in Japan is mainly
responsible for higher domestic prices, it said.
    The strong yen has meant lower input material prices but
has also resulted in higher agricultural imports which has
worsened working conditions among part-time farmers, the paper
said.
    This could make it difficult to improve the industry's
structure, the paper said.
    To solve these problems and to reduce farm product prices
to more reasonable levels, Japan should try to restructure the
the agricultural sector to improve productivity and make it
self-supporting, it said.

President Reagan's reduced strength
in Congress has been demonstrated by the U.S. Senate's decision
to approve a highway spending bill despite his attempts to veto
it, political analysts said.
    "He's very weakened," said William Schneider of the private
American Enterprise public policy group after the Senate voted
67-33 yesterday to ignore Reagan's veto of the road bill.
    Schneider contrasted Reagan's failure with his previous
ability to win clear majorities on major issues.
    Sustaining his veto required him to win just one-third of
the votes in either house of Congress.
    It was the third consecutive fight over a presidential veto
on which Congress had defied Reagan, whose clout with the
legislature has been greatly diminished by the arms-for-Iran
scandal and the capture of a majority in the Senate by the
opposition Democratic party in the November 1986 election.
    Congress overrode Reagan's veto of a popular water projects
bill in January and last autumn Congress rejected his veto of
economic sanctions against South Africa.
    But this time the president laid his full authority on the
line, even making a rare journey to Capitol Hill to plead for
support in person.
    With both the House and Senate in Democratic hands,
analysts say Reagan is swiftly becoming a lame duck, facing
difficulties in enacting his own legislative agenda, especially
given the furore over the Iran arms deal.
    The situation contrasts with Reagan's first six years in
office when a Republican-controlled Senate and the backing of
conservative Democrats in the House enabled Reagan to win
passage of most of his legislative priorities.
    Reagan's ability to veto legislation he dislikes had been
his strongest weapon in dealing with Congress, but his defeat
on the highway bill was expected to reduce the credibility of
his veto power.
    Senator John Chafee, a Rhode Island Republican, told the
New York Times earlier this week that if Reagan lost "there will
be no brake on -- if you suggest a presidential veto you will
be laughed away."
    Yesterday's defeat came two days after the House of
Representatives' overwhelming rejection of a presidential veto
on the highways bill by 350 votes to 73.
    White House strategists had presented the veto fight as a
test of Reagan's strength as he attempted to recover from the
scandal over secret arms sales to Iran.
    Senate Republican leader Robert Dole of Kansas pleaded with
fellow party members to back Reagan because "this may determine
the strength of the presidency for the next 21 months."
    The defeat showed the problems facing any president in his
final years in office. Reagan's term expires in January 1989.
    A majority of Republicans in the House of Representatives
and 13 in the Senate apparently decided their own political
concerns have become more important than the president's.
    "President Reagan, he ain't going to be running in 1988, but
I am," Congressman Arthur Ravenel, a South Carolina Republican,
said on Tuesday of his decision to back a bill that means money
and jobs for his home district in new highway construction.
    The defeat interrupted a good streak for Reagan, who won
applause for his selection in February of former Senate
majority leader Howard Baker to replace Donald Regan as White
House chief of staff, and was believed by most political
analysts to have benefitted from a televised speech and a news
conference on the Iran affair last month.
    A steady drop in Reagan's job approval ratings appeared to
level off in recent weeks. The president slumped from about 65
pct last autumn to about 42 pct after the Tower Commission
report in February said he had failed to exercise proper
control over the dealings with Iran.
    His approval rating hovers at 50 pct.
    Reagan said he was deeply disappointed by the Senate defeat
but "my efforts to control spending are not diminished."
    Democratic leader Robert Byrd said "this isn't going to make
or break the president."

direction is soft," one dealer said.
    The dollar could well come under renewed pressure after the
international forums as attention returned to the U.S. And the
U.K.'s trade dispute with Japan, dealers said.
    Cross currency trading was also subdued though sterling's
rise above 1.60 dlrs helped it to firm against the mark. It was
fixed higher at 2.924 marks after yesterday's 2.910.
    The pound was seen staying between 2.90 and 2.93 marks for

West Germany's chemical
industry fears mounting risks will hurt earnings but hopes 1987
turnover will stabilize around 1986's 140 billion marks, Josef
Strenger, a board member of the industry association VCI, said.
    Strenger, management board chairman of Bayer AG <BAYG.F>,
told a news conference at the Hanover trade fair the main
dangers were stagnation in world trade, the lower dollar as
well as crude oil and commodity prices.
    Prospects of higher operating costs were also seen harming
earnings, he said. Turnover took a considerable downturn at the
start of 1987 after falling 5.9 pct in 1986.
    The chemical industry, which relies heavily on exports, was
badly hit by mark appreciation in 1986 and lower turnover was
mainly due to foreign exchange losses, Strenger said.
    Exports fell 6.4 pct to 72 billion marks in 1986 and
competition from U.S. And British firms increased. Savings from
lower oil and commodity prices were eaten up by price
competition and increased costs.
    Strenger said 1986 operating profits of German chemical
firms were slightly worse than the year before but the improved
financial and balance sheet structure, after three good years,
neutralized the negative impact.
    Strenger said the industry would try to increase production
in the U.S. To make up for lost export possibilities out of
West Germany.
    The lower dollar was the main reason for an 8.3 pct fall in
exports to North America, an 11.4 pct drop to Latin America and
22.6 pct plunge to the Middle East.
    Exports to Western Europe eased 3.5 pct and Far East
exports, due to an economic revival in Japan, dropped 5.2 pct.
    Strenger noted that the industry had lost public confidence
following several cases of chemical pollution of the Rhine late
last year.

The departure of James Baker's
closest aide, Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman, will
not change the course of Washington's domestic and
international economic policies, U.S. officials said.
    Darman, who has worked alongside Baker for six years, was
widely credited with helping him mastermind initiatives on
currency management and international economic cooperation.
    U.S. Officials said Darman also played a key role in
shepherding President Reagan's sweeping tax reform plan through
the U.S. Congress.
    But they flatly dismissed suggestions that his departure,
to the investment banking firm of Shearson Lehman Brothers,
signaled the Baker team was breaking up, or that the Treasury
Secretary himself might leave soon.
    "It really does not mean that, he took the opportunity as it
came up," one official said.
    Another commented, "Baker will miss him, but he's not going
to stand in his way."
    There has been widespread speculation since last autumn
that Darman sought a Wall Street job.
    Officials said Darman felt the passage of tax reform late
last year marked an appropriate moment to bow out.
    Baker acknowledged Darman would be sorely missed.
    "Dick Darman has contributed mightily to the success of this
administration over the past six years and his departure
represents a substantial loss," he said.
    U.S. Officials admitted Darman's absence would be an
undoubted blow to Baker, who has relied on him for policy
advice, both at the White House and, in Reagan's second term,
at the Treasury. One aide once described Darman as
"indispensable" to Baker.
    Baker is widely thought to want a more stable currency
system and Darman is generally credited by officials of other
nations as Baker's leading theorist on this issue, favouring
target zones to limit currency fluctuations.
    Earlier this year, monetary sources said the U.S. Treasury
unsuccessfully sounded out allies on a target zone system.
    But a U.S. Official disputed the assessment that, with
Darman gone, Baker would abandon international initiatives.
    Baker's work as head of Reagan's Economic Policy Council,
spearheading trade policy, and his skills in negotiating with
the Democrat-controlled Congress will go on as before.
    Darman's strength was not as an economist, but as a
political strategist "and that's Baker's strength too," the
official said.
    There were already indications that Baker, who throughout
his time in government has relied on a closely-knit circle of
advisers, has moved swiftly to find a successor.
    One possibility is that Baker might turn to George Gould,
who holds the number three Treasury position of
Under-Secretary.
    Gould, another close confidante, has known Baker for years.
    Before joining the Treasury in November 1985, Gould was a
partner at the Wall Steet firm of Wertheim and Co and formerly
headed Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette Securities Corp.
    The Darman announcement came on the eve of the semi-annual
meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank,
where many policies Darman helped shape will be debated.
    He helped Baker devise the September, 1985 Plaza Agreement,
when the United States, Japan, West Germany, France and Britain
curbed the dollar's strength. The pact was a major turning
point in U.S. Policy, ending a period of disdain for economic
cooperation and intervention in currency markets.
    Darman also worked on some other Baker initiatives, like
the Tokyo Summit agreement to intensify coordination of
economic policies among the leading industrial countries and
the recent Paris Agreement to stabilise currencies and
stimulate global growth.
    These policies are collectively aimed at redressing the
huge gap between Japan and West Germany's trade surpluses and
the United State's massive trade deficit.
    That policy goal still remains a prime objective of the
Reagan Administration and will not change with Darman's
departure.

The U.S. civilian unemployment rate
fell to 6.6 pct in March from 6.7 pct in February, the Labor
Department said.
    The number of non-farm payroll jobs rose 164,000 last month
after rising a revised 236,000 in February. That was down from
the previously reported 337,000 rise in February.
    The March unemployment rate was the lowest since March,
1980. It had remained unchanged at 6.7 pct for three straight
months before the March decline.
    The rise in non-farm payrolls was the smallest since a
decline last June of 75,000, the department said.
    Last month's unemployment rate was down from the 7.2 pct
level in March, 1986.
    Growth in jobs continued in March but was slower than in
recent months, with the gains concentrated in service
industries.
    The number of goods-producing jobs fell 68,000 in March,
while service-producing jobs rose 232,000 to bring the total
jobs in the department's survey of businesses to 102.03 mln in
March.
    Business and health services showed the largest gains in
jobs, while manufacturing employment fell by 25,000.
    The average work week fell to 34.8 hours in March from 35.0
hours in February, the department said.
    Manufacturing hours fell to 40.9 per week from 41.2 hours
in February, but overtime hours increased to 3.7 from 3.6.
    The department's survey of households showed the number of
unemployed stood at 7.85 mln out of a work force of 119.2 mln.
    The number of persons working part time for economic
reasons fell in March to 5.46 mln from 5.78 mln in February.
    The loss of factory jobs brought the March total to 19.19
mln jobs and was concentrated in automobile, electrical and
electronic manufacturing.
    Construction employment also lowered the number of jobs in
the goods-producing sector, falling by 45,000 after seasonal
adjustment, the department said.
    Mining employment was little changed in March and has not
experienced any substantial erosion since the rapid job losses
in oil and gas drilling in the first two-thirds of 1986.
    Other service industries that increased jobs last month
were finance, insurance, and real estate.

Japan should increase foreign access to
its farm products market, while encouraging further development
of domestic agriculture, a government report said.
    The white paper on agriculture for the year ended March 31
said active participation in writing world farm trade rules at
the next round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)
talks will help prepare Japan to improve access.
    Agriculture Ministry sources said the paper marked an
easing in Japan's tough position on agricultural imports which
stressed the need for strict controls on some products to
maintain self-sufficiency in food.
    Japan now produces only 30 pct of its annual grain needs,
down from 61 pct some 20 years ago, official figures show.
    The paper said Japanese agriculture has been slow to
improve productivity and demand/supply imbalances.
    The relative shortage of farmland in Japan is mainly
responsible for higher domestic prices, it said.
    The strong yen has meant lower input material prices but
has also resulted in higher agricultural imports which has
worsened working conditions among part-time farmers, the paper
said.
    This could make it difficult to improve the industry's
structure, the paper said.
    To solve these problems and to reduce farm product prices
to more reasonable levels, Japan should try to restructure the
the agricultural sector to improve productivity and make it
self-supporting, it said.

funds to completely retire its existing bank debt.
    It said the loan agreement provides for up to 30 mln dlrs
of borrowing power.
    After repayment of existing bank debt and providing for
certain letters of credit, 4.3 mln dlrs remains for future
needs, the company said.
    EAC said the new lending arrangement will allow it to focus
attention on improving the company's basic business. It added
that it anticipates the fiscal year that began Feb 1, 1987,
will be a "significant improvement" over the year ended January
31.
    It said the loans mature in March 1990.

The Bundesbank's gross currency
reserves rose 300 mln marks in the last week of March to 104.9
billion marks, the Bundesbank said in a statement.
    At the same time its foreign liabilities rose 100 mln to
22.8 billion, producing a rise in net reserves of 200 mln to
82.2 billion on March 31.
    The Bundesbank provided banks with liquidity in the fourth
March week by disbursing funds in the money market via
government-owned banks. Banks took up the Bundesbank's standing
offer of treasury bills to place excess liquidity.
    Banks received more liquidity through routine month-end
payments by public authorities as well as expansionary market
factors than was lost through the 2.3 billion mark rise in cash
in circulation to 122.3 billion, the Bundesbank said.
    But banks had to draw heavily on the Lombard emergency
financing facility due to month-end tightness, borrowing 5.3
billion marks.
    Overall, banks' holdings at the Bundesbank rose 10.2
billion marks to 58.5 billion at the end of the month,
averaging 50.9 billion in the whole of March.
    The minimum reserve requirement for March, before deduction
of banks' cash holdings, was set at 61 billion marks.
    Public authorities' net holdings at the Bundesbank fell to
2.2 billion marks in the last March week from 4.4 billion the
week before. The federal states' holdings fell 2.6 billion to
2.4 billion.
    The federal government's holdings rose 700 mln marks to 5.1
billion.

Overseas securities firms are spending
millions of dollars to set up operations in Tokyo, but many
will end up losing money, industry sources said.
    For banks and securities firms eager to establish
themselves as international players, building a presence in
Japan has become an imperative. Thirty-six are already licensed
to trade securities on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the world's
second largest. More than 50 are expected by year-end.
    But, as deregulation erodes brokers' profits and the global
share-buying spree is predicted to subside, only those
securities traders with first-class financial muscle will
survive, the sources said.
    "There will be foreigners' fallout. They come in here with
too glib ideas about how they can survive," said David Miller,
director and general manager of Jardine Fleming (Securities)
Ltd's Tokyo branch.
    Despite soaring share prices, sharp falls in commissions on
stock transactions have hurt even brokerages that came to Tokyo
early.
    "Japanese equities are no longer a very profitable business.
The margins are nothing like they were two or three years ago.
Things are not as rosy as they may seem," Miller said.
    Publicly reported earnings of foreign securities houses in
Japan for the half-year ended September 30, 1986, showed
Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd on top with profits of 1.7 billion
yen. Most other firms reported hefty gains over the year
before. But industry sources say the figures do not fully
reveal the costs of running an international brokerage in the
world's most expensive city.
    Salary packages with free housing for novice analysts
routinely run more than 100,000 dlrs a year. Miller, whose firm
had earnings of 1.4 billion yen for the half-year to September
1986, said costs for an operation strong enough to endure are
10 to 15 mln dlrs a year. "I'd be surprised if more than two or
three were making money if they honestly accounted for their
costs," he said.
    To bring commissions closer to world rates, the Finance
Ministry slashed fixed brokerage fees last year, especially on
large-lot deals. In a few years, all rates may be negotiated as
they are in New York and London, industry sources said.
    Since last October's Big Bang deregulation of London's
financial markets, at least half the equity trading deals there
have generated no commission income at all. Stockbroking firms
are unlikely to make money until some are forced out of
business, analysts said.
    The first foreign firms to set up here, especially the six
admitted as members in February 1986, have an advantage over
the latecomers, they said. The six are <Merrill Lynch Japan
Inc>, <Goldman Sachs International Corp>, <Morgan Stanley
International Inc>, <Vickers Da Costa Ltd>, <Jardine Fleming
Securities Ltd> and <S.G. Warburg and Co (Japan) Ltd>.
    The memberships, which cost about five mln dlrs, allow
firms to execute their own trades and, unlike houses with
branch status, avoid paying away 27 pct of their commissions to
have member firms place trades.
    Members can also communicate instantly with the exchange
floor, a vital source of information in a market that tends to
follow the leader. Sources said seven to 10 more seats on the
exchange are likely to open up sometime in 1988.
    For non-member firms, wrestling away market share from
tenacious Japanese and foreign firms is costly and intangibles
sometimes prove even more important than exchange membership.
    "Your name is better known if you're a member of the right
club," Miller said. "It's easier to hire ... New people."
    To inaugurate its Japan operation, <SBCI Securities (Asia)
Ltd> flew out the Basel Ballet last January for receptions in
Tokyo and Osaka. The firm, 50 pct owned by <Swiss Bank Corp>,
gave guests gifts of Swiss chocolates and Swatch watches.
    "It's expensive, but a party like that is a token of the
serious way we regard our development in Tokyo," SBCI's Tokyo
branch manager Gregory Shenkman said.
    To establish its position quickly, SBCI hired a 26-strong
research unit from <W.I. Carr (Overseas) Ltd>'s Tokyo office.
    "I was very lucky," Shenkman said. "I was anticipating a
considerable struggle to organically develop a research team.
    "I am not particularly optimistic for the prospects in the
Japanese equity market for continental European banks who have
little experience in equities outside their domestic equity
market," he said.
    But the prospect of closing down operations may be worse.
    "One would be ill-advised to open here and close, and then
decide to open again two or three years later. I'm not sure the
Japansese community would respond well to that sort of
attitude," he said.

Praxis Pharmaceuticals Inc, which owns
worldwide licensing rights to the promising AIDS treatment
AL721, said large scale tests of the drug are planned for this
summer in the United States.
    Arnold Lippa, Praxis' president, said Praxis will test the
drug in a few hundred patients with full-blown AIDS, in those
with AIDS-related complex, a precursor to AIDS, and in more
patients with swollen lymph glands but no other AIDS symptoms.
    Praxis reported a net loss of 2,186,000 dlrs for the year
ended June 30, 1986. Lippa said the firm has about two mln dlrs
left from its public offering in January 1985.
    But Lippa expects to "easily spend" five to 10 mln dlrs in
these new clinical trials. He said the Beverly-Hills,
Calif.-based company is preparing a private offering and
discussing ventures with other pharmaceutical firms to help
finance the cost of the trials.
    As another mark of the interest in AL721, Anthony S. Fauci,
who heads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Disease, said the government will begin testing AL721 in its
AIDS treatment evaluation units in June.
    A spokeswoman said the study will be "small" and will
establish the drug's toxicity. She said the study will be
"expedited" to allow the next phase of testing to proceed
rapidly.
    These plans follow the completion of a small-scale test of
the drug's effectiveness in eight patients with AIDS-related
lymphadenopathy--swollen lymph glands, at St. Lukes/Roosevelt
Hospital in New York, and another study of 14 AIDS patients in
Israel, where the drug was developed.

told reporters after a speech commemorating the 100th

    Senate Budget Chairman Lawton Chiles (D-Fla.) "is obviously

Chiles' budget plan and will try again next week.

speak at the event as he favored the agency's abolition.

again for a fantastic wake," he said to mild applause.

Time Inc's chief financial officer,
Thayer Bigelow, told security analysts the company is
"comfortable" with Wall Street estimates that 1987 earnings
will be in a range of 3.75 dlrs to 4.25 dlrs per share.
    In 1986, Time reported earnings of 5.95 dlrs per share,
including a number of special items.
    Bigelow said in adjusting the 1986 results for the special
items and also removing the earnings of American Television and
Communications Corp <ATCMA>, Time earned 2.35 dlrs per share in
1986.
    Turner Broadcasting System Inc said the investment by the
cable consortium would be in Turner Broadcasting, not directly
in CNN. The consortium would infuse up to 550 mln dlrs in
Turner Broadcasting in return for a 35 pct equity interest.
    Ted Turner, Chairman, would retain a 51 pct interest, a
Turner Broadcasting spokesman said.
    Bigelow said the company is continuing its previously
announced 10 mln share repurchase program and has bought back
4.1 mln of its own shares. He said 700,000 shares were
purchased in the first quarter of 1987 at an average price of
81 dlrs per share.
    Bigelow said the company will always have a share buyback
program in place whenever it believes it is a better long-term
investment than starting or acquring a business. But he did not
give any specifics on further repurchases beyond the 10 mln
shares already announced.

chief executive said the company is not interested in investing

In 1986 the company purchased Scott and Foresman, its biggest
acquisition ever.

the company might be interested in a relatively small book
business.

The European Commission's decision to
release an additional 300,000 tonnes of British intervention
feed wheat for the home market will provide only moderate
relief in an increasingly tight market, traders said.
    Some operators had been anticipating a larger tonnage,
pointing out that at this week's U.K. Intervention tender the
market sought to buy 340,000 tonnes but only 126,000 tonnes
were granted.
    The new tranche of intervention grain is unlikely to
satisfy demand, they said, and keen buying competition for
supplies in stores is expected to keep prices firm.
    The release of the feed wheat followed recent strong
representations by the U.K. Grain trade to the Commission.
There has been growing concern that rising internal prices,
triggered by heavy exports, were creating areas of shortage in
interior markets.
    The latest EC authorisation will add 70,000 tonnes at the
April 14 tender and a further 30,000 tonnes later in the month.
The remaining 200,000 tonnes will be made available in May and
June.
    News of the release produced an early downward reaction in
local physical markets, but by midday some sections had halved
early two stg losses while others were unchanged.
    Ministry of Agriculture figures for March indicate 1.85 mln
tonnes of wheat and 1.74 mln tonnes of barley remain in the
free market. However, some traders believe these figures are
overstated and, while some may still be held on the farm, the
bulk of wheat is already sold. Some of the grain is also off
the market in futures stores.
    A total of 2.10 mln tonnes of intervention wheat has been
sold for export or to the home market since the season started
July 1, leaving an unsold balance in intervention of about 1.59
mln tonnes.
    Intervention barley sales have reached just over 1.0 mln
tonnes, leaving about 753,000 tonnes, traders said.
    This season's U.K. Export performance has surpassed all
early expectations and has created the present nervous
situation in domestic markets where the fear now is free market
supplies may not last out until new crop becomes available in
August.
    The market is sticking to its recent prediction of total
barley and wheat exports of around 10.5 mln tonnes, a new
record and nearly double the previous record of 5.9 mln tonnes
achieved in the 1984/85 season.
    Traders expect U.K. Wheat exports to reach 6.0 mln and
barley around 4.50 mln tonnes.
    The Soviet Union has booked a record total of 2.5 mln
tonnes of British wheat and barley this season, but only 1.28
mln had surfaced in Customs export figures by March 25, traders
said.
    Other EC countries have bought large amounts of British
grain and for the July 1/March 25 period had taken 2.59 mln
tonnes of wheat and 2.06 mln tonnes of barley. This compares
with 1.28 mln and 868,700 tonnes last season.
    The market is expecting prices, particularly wheat, to stay
buoyant for the remaining few months of the season. If supplies
become more difficult and prices strengthen further, feed
compounders may increase cereal substitute usage, traders said.

Coastal Corp said it will file an
alternate proposal to reorganize TransAmerican Natural Gas
Corp, the privately-owned Texas firm in bankruptcy, on April
15.
    Coastal said the proposal will be filed with the bankruptcy
court and is expected to be heard on April 29 and 30, along
with TransAmerican's separately filed reorganization plan.
    In a letter to shareholders indicting TransAmerican's
campaign to thwart a takeover, Coastal said TransAmerican "has
mounted a campaign in Texas to smear Coastal and misrepresent
its intentions."
    The letter, written by Coastal Chairman Oscar S. Wyatt Jr
and President James R. Paul, exhorted shareholders to "consider
TransAmerican's smear campgian for what it is--a misguided
attempt to bias the outcome of the bankruptcy proceedings by a
company with an unsavory business reputation and a history of
being in bankruptcy for nine of the past 12 years."
    TransAmerican said it had not seen the letter, and could
not comment. TransAmerican's lawyer, John Nabors, was not
immediately available for comment.
    The letter sent to all Coastal employees and stockholders
in Texas also accused John R. Stanley, TransAmerican's owner,
of prospering by the companies' bankruptcy by drawing a salary
of 300,000 dlrs a year from his bankrupt companies.
    It also said that at the end of July 1986, Stanley owed his
bankrupt companies 874,000 dlrs in unpaid interest-free loans.
"His creditors may suffer but Mr. Stanley does quite well in
bankruptcy," said the letter.

Rohm and Haas Co said health
studies on workers at its Philadelphia plant showed higher
death rates from four kinds of cancer compared with mortality
rates among the general public.
    The studies covered a total of about 6,000 workers employed
at the plant from 1948 through 1981.
    Mortality rates from two other types of cancer, respiratory
cancer and leukemia, had declined compared to earlier studies,
the plastics and chemicals company said.
    Potential causes and incidence of pancreatic, colon/rectal,
prostate and bladder cancer will be studied further, a company
spokesman said.
    The studies found elevated mortality rates from the four
cancer types. But the finding does not appear to be linked with
products or processes at the plant, Rohm and Haas said.
    The reports revealed no new evidence of health risk from
operations at the plant, it added.
    Respiratory cancer deaths among workers exposed to certain
chemical operations before 1971 remain elevated but have
declined from levels reported in 1974. And deaths from leukemia
have fallen to near normal levels from those reported in 1975.
    A study completed in 1974 after an outbreak of respiratory
cancer among employees linked the disease to exposure to a
carcinogen, bischloromethyl ether, which is made at the plant.
    The production of the chemical, an intermediary used in
making industrial fluid cleaners, was isolated in 1971 so
workers were no longer exposed to it, the spokesman said.
    Last summer, Rohm and Haas settled 22 individual lawsuits
and one class action suit related to deaths from exposure to
the chemical.

    The FAA action follows a warning to the airlines by the
plane's maker, Douglas Aircraft Co, that three cracks had been

    Douglas Aircraft is a unit of McDonnell Douglas Corp.
    Such cracks typically are caused by metal fatigue and pose
no safety risk if repaired.
    The cracks were found in the metal skin covering the tail,
during aircraft maintenance.
    If not detected and repaired, the cracks "may progress until
the spar cap or skin panel is severed, which could result in
structural failure," the FAA order said.
    The spar cap is the top part of the tail wings' main beam.

Compaq Computer Corp, IBM's chief
rival in the personal computer market, scored a big gain on
Wall Street today. Compaq's stock rose 1-3/8 to 32-1/4 on
volume of 1.3 mln shares.
    "The rationale for the move," one trader said, "is that the
damage from the IBM announcement yesterday was less than
expected." He said Compaq's stock had been under pressure
recently because of anticipation of IBM's unveiling of a new
line of personal computers.
    International Business Machines <IBM> introduced four new
personal computers and more than 100 new peripheral products.
But analysts said the new computers, though they do contain a
lot of proprietary concepts, will not be as hard to copy as
some other PC makers had feared.
    "The long range issue here is who wins and who loses in the
PC business, and that issue was not resolved yesterday and is
unlikely to be decided any time soon," analyst Mark Stahlman of
Sanford C. Bernstein and Co said.
    Stahlman reaffirmed his recommendation of Compaq and Apple
Computer Inc <AAPL>.
    Stahlman said "The critical investment question now is who
will have a pickup in sales in the near term. We expect to see
a strong demand setting for PCs for the rest of this year, and
that will boost the revenues for all of the major PC vendors."
    "The first quarter was the strongest PC sales period on
record for Compaq, Apple and IBM," Stahlman said, "and I don't
think the IBM announcement is going to change that trend soon."
    "In anticipating the IBM announcement, Compaq has made
pricing adjustments necessary to compete for its immediate
purposes," he said.

    Supermarkets is best known for its Pathmark chain of

A steep drop in goods-producing jobs
detracted from U.S. March non-farm payroll employment and makes
it unlikely that the Federal Reserve will tighten monetary
policy to defend the dollar, economists said.
    U.S. March non-farm payroll employment rose 164,000, less
than the gain of 220,000 to 290,000 the financial markets
expected. Manufacturing employment fell 25,000, compared with
February's 50,000 gain, while March construction employment
dropped 45,000 after being unchanged in February.
    "The momentum of industrial activity is tapering off as we
end the first quarter," said Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley
and Co Inc. "This sets the stage for more sluggish growth in
the second and third quarters."
    "The Fed will view this as a caution flag on the economy,"
he said. "They will not ease as long the dollar is weak, but
clearly they can't tighten."
    David Wyss of Data Resources Inc said that the downward
revision in February non-farm payroll employment to 236,000
from 337,000 means that employment gains in the first quarter
were weaker than expected.
    While Wyss left his first-quarter forecast of real U.S.
gross national product growth at 3.5 pct, he said the March
jobs data suggested a downward revision in his second-quarter
growth forecast to 2.5 pct from 2.8 pct.
    Bill Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc said the average
monthly gain in non-farm jobs in the first quarter was only
237,000, compared with 254,000 in the fourth quarter of 1986.
    "There's momentum in first quarter labor force activity, 
but less than assumed," he said. "Gains in goods-producing jobs
were subdued at best. This rules out any possibilty of the Fed
tightening for exchange-related purposes."
    In March, the average workweek fell back to its January
level of 34.8 hours from 35.0 hours in February. Manufacturing
hours also fell back to their January level, totalling 40.9
hours in March compared with 41.2 hours in February.
    The Commerce Department noted that loss of manufacturing
jobs in March was concentrated in automobile, electrical and 
electronic manufacturing.
    Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities International said that a
13,000 decline in auto manufacturing employment accounted for
nearly half of the total drop in manufacturing jobs.
    Economists said that a build-up in auto inventories
resulting from a steep drop in sales has finally caught up with
the labor force and may point to slower growth ahead.
    Most expect an increase in inventories of as much as five
pct to offset a steep four to five pct drop in final sales in
the first-quarter GNP accounts.
    Roach said he expects first quarter U.S. GNP to rise two
pct, to be followed by a gain of 1.0-1.5 pct at best in the
second and third quarters. He said the March drop in industrial
activity "is a reasonable response in light of the inordinate
contribution inventory accumulation made to GNP."
    Economists said the employment data also suggest weak gains
in industrial production and personal income for March.
They expect only marginal gains, if not small declines, for
these indicators, compared with a February increases of 0.5 pct
in industrial production and 0.9 pct in personal income.
    Steve Slifer of Lehman Government Securities said the drop
in March construction employment may also signal a drop in
March housing starts, which rose 2.6 pct in February to 1.851
million units at an annual rate from 1.804 million units in
January.
    The rate of unemployment fell to 6.6 pct, its lowest level
since March 1980, from 6.7 pct in February. But Wyss pointed
out that this resulted from a drop in the labor force, which 
fell to 119.2 mln in March from 119.35 mln in February.
    "This just means that there were fewer people looking for
work, so the drop in unemployment doesn't mean much," he said.
    He said the latest employment report will not concern the
Fed because it does points to GNP growth in the first half of
2.5-3.0 pct, but "it does suggest they can't afford to tighten
to quickly either."
    The statistical factors used to smooth out seasonal
fluctuations in the jobs data may have understated March labor
force gains, just as seasonal factors probably overstated them
in January and February, Slifer said, but are consistent with
his forecast of 1.8 pct first quarter GNP growth.
    Economic growth remains sluggish, but Silfer does not think
that the Federal Open Market Committee changed policy at their
meeting this week. "At some point they will be more inclined to
ease," he said. For the time being, however, the March
employment report "increases the likelihood they won't tighten,
regardless of the dollar."

Several pharmaceutical companies, drawn
in the 1970s to the fast growing cosmetics industry, are no
longer finding it fashionable to sell makeup.
    "The fad right now is to purify and concentrate on the most
attractive business. Right now that's the drug business," said
David Saks, an analyst with Morgan, Olmstead.
    Yesterday, Eli Lilly and Co joined the ranks of other drug
companies by choosing to sell off its lower growth Elizabeth
Arden cosmetics business.
    "It's not that Elizabeth Arden is bad. To some it may be
their pride and joy, but to Eli Lilly, it's a diversion of
their management energies and financial resources from their
gemstone, which is the drug business," Saks said.
    "Arden is a good company. I'm sure it's going to be a hot
property. I'm sure people will be lining up to buy it," said
Lynne Hyman, E.F. Hutton cosmetics analyst.
    Analysts said the Arden business could command about 600
mln dlrs, and likely buyers would be interested in its
well-known name and distribution channels.
                                   
    Analysts said Avon Products Inc, a door-to-door makeup
distributor, and the Japanese company Shiseido Co of Tokyo,
might be willing buyers. An Avon spokesman said the company is
interested in Arden, but it has not yet seen offering
documents.
    Analysts said most of the changes of control in the
cosmetics industry have been determined for the time being.
"There's not much out there that hasn't changed hands or isn't
relatively stable," said Hyman.
    Squibb <SQB> last year sold its Charles of the Ritz
business to Yves Saint Laurent for 630 mln dlrs, and Beecham
Plc said last month it was selling its Germain Monteil unit to
Revlon Group <REV>.
    American Cyanamid <ACY>, a chemical and drug concern, is
selling its Jacqueline Cochran Inc unit.
    One big cosmetics concern whose fate hasn't been sealed is
Revlon Group Inc. The company received a takeover offer from
McAndrews and Forbes, which is controlled by its chairman,
Ronald Perelman.
    A major Revlon shareholder, McAndrews and Forbes, is
offering 18.50 dlrs per share to take the company private. But
Wall Street has been estimating values for the company of 20
dlrs per share and more. The stock was trading today at 20-7/8,
off 1/2.
    Analysts said Revlon's cosmetics lines and name might be
attractive to a corporate buyer, but they doubt one would jump
into the situation one analyst described as a "can of worms."
    Analysts said drug companies are getting high prices for
the cosmetics companies. They said buyers are attracted by
strong brand names because of profit stability and prestige.

The Securities and Exchange
Commission reminded corporate raiders and others tendering for
the shares of companies that they must extend the period their
offers are open if key conditions are changed.
    Specifically, the agency said those making tender offers
for companies' stock must extend the offers if they decide to
eliminate conditions requiring a minimum number of shares to be
tendered in order for the offers to be valid.
    Tender offers typically include minimum share conditions.
As a result, a purchaser would not be bound to buy the shares
that were tendered if the minimum level were not reached.
    In an interpretation of current rules, which officials said
clarifies the SEC's present position, the agency said a tender
offer must be extended if a minimum share condition is waived,
even if the purchaser reserved the right to do so.
    The interpretation makes clear that waiving a minimum share
condition is a "material change" of the tender offer under U.S.
securities law, SEC officials said.
    The SEC has already said that other specific material
changes, such as changes in the percentage of securities being
sought or the price being offered, made during the course of a
tender offer require a 10-day extension of the offer.
    The length of the extension, which is aimed at giving
shareholders an adequate chance to assess revisions of a tender
offer, was not specified in cases where the minimum share
conditions were waived.
    SEC officials said the length of the extension in such
cases would depend on the facts and circumstances surrounding
each case, but would generally be between five and 10 days.
    The agency cited two recent tender offers in which waivers
of a minimum share conditios were tried on the last day of each
offer, denying shareholders the chance to react to the new
information. Officials declined to identify the two offers.
    "If a bidder makes a material change near or at the end of
its offer, it will have to extend the offer to permit adequate
dissemination," the SEC said.
    Federal securities law requires that all tender offers
remain open for at least 20 business days.

analyst Peter Appert of C.J. Lawrence said. "Their (Fox) saving
grace is that their parent has deep pockets."
    The question television industry, advertising and Wall
Street executives are asking is whether this new entry can lure
advertisers from the big three: CBS Inc <CBS>, ABC, and NBC, a
unit of General Electric Co <GE>.
    Network advertising revenues rose to 8.6 billion dlrs in
1986 from 8.3 billion a year earlier, with NBC accounting for
all of the gain. Revenues at CBS and ABC declined, analysts
noted.
    "They (Fox) are competing for the same pool of funds as the
traditional networks," said Jon Mandel, associate media
director at Grey Advertising Inc.
    But James Mandelbaum, a Los Angeles-based entertainment
attorney said, "If they have enough money, they have a good
chance of making it work."
    Fox president Jamie Kellner said the company expects to
lose 30 to 50 mln dlrs this year on revenues of about 150 mln
dlrs. He said it will take three to five years to turn a
profit.
    To succeed, the company must also win over the young
viewership it has targeted with an offbeat set of shows, two of
which debut this Sunday, and another, next weekend.
    The first Fox-produced program -- "The Late Show,"
featuring comedienne Joan Rivers -- was shown last fall on
Fox's seven stations and close to 100 affiliates. Although the
show has dropped recently in ratings, it still has a captive
young audience in the late night time slot, analysts said.
    Sunday's prime-time shows include a situation comedy,
"Married ... with Children," which Kellner describes as an
alternative to the suger coated family shows on the networks.
It is also airing "The Tracy Ullman Show," featuring the
British comedienne, singer and actress.
    Fox has lined up 107 independent TV stations around the
U.S. to run the shows. The networks have some 637 affiated
stations.
    To make sure viewers get a chance to see the programs, the
company is taking the unprecedented step of airing them three
times in the course of the evening.
    "I believe if some of their shows were on the traditional
networks, it would be extremely high-rated," Mandel said, who
added that his firm has signed up several million dlrs in
advertising for the shows.
    But some question whether Fox will really become a fourth
network. Robert Adler, president of the Cabletelevision
Advertising Bureau, said many cable shows are geared to the
audience Fox is attempting to win. "There are already many
alternatives out there to the three networks," he said.
    And at least one network is not yet ready to consider Fox
the competition. An ABC spokesman said, "the schedule we've put
together for this Sunday night ... has not taken Fox's
programming schedule into account."
    But analysts noted that the major networks are keeping a
eye on the venture to see how it fares in the ratings and with
its advertisers.
    Fox also appears willing to take a long-term view. Asked
whether the company will be looking at ratings after Sunday's
debut, Kellner said, "the last thing I want to do is worry
about ratings because that was the last thing Murdoch told me
to do."

U.S. scientists said some tropical
vegetable oils can be hazardous to consumers whose health is at
risk because of high levels of saturated fat, lending weight to
a campaign by the American Soybean Association (ASA) for
labelling changes.
    The scientists appeared to support an ASA charge, denied by
Malaysian palm growers, that imported coconut, palm and palm
kernel oils contain high levels of saturated fat and thus raise
blood cholesterol and the risk of heart disease.
    In a petition filed in January, the ASA asked the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) to require palm, palm kernel and
coconut oils to be identified as saturated fats on food
manufacturers' labels.
    The FDA responded to the ASA in a letter saying it would
consider the petition as a comment to a proposed rule dealing
with cholesterol and fatty acid labelling of foods.
    Malaysian oil palm growers have said the charges by the ASA
that palm oil consumption increases blood cholesterol and
contributes to heart disease are untrue.
    But Steve Chang, Professor of Food Science at Rutgers
University, said, "Palm oil is definitely not good for human
health because it has a high content of saturated fatty acid."
    He added that the higher the fatty acid, the greater the
blood cholesterol level. "It has been well established that
high cholesterol levels will have a higher level of heart
disease," he said.
    A Malaysian Oil Palm Growers Council official, Borge
Bek-Nielsen, has said studies have shown that palm oil is
cholesterol-free, low in saturated fats, has anti-cancer
properties and prevents blood clotting and blocking of arteries
in humans.
    Bek-Nielsen said Americans consume more saturated fats
daily through food like butter, bacon, ham and beef than from
palm oil, which, he added is rich in vitamins A and E.
    David Kritchevsky, Associate Director of the Wistar
Institute in Philadelphia, appeared to take the ASA view on
labelling. "What people really have to learn is to read labels,"
said Kritchevsky. "The more a consumer knows, the more likely he
will make an intelligent choice."
    The U.S. scientists said they had no doubt imported palm,
palm kernel and coconut oils contain high saturated fat levels.
    Kritchevsky, a specialist in nutrition, said, "More
saturated fat would raise cholesterol levels...So, from that
point of view it's a health risk. High cholesterol levels in
the blood are a risk factor for heart disease."
    Susanne Harris, deputy assistant secretary of the U.S.
Agriculture Department's Food and Consumer Services Division,
said the health risk among consumers of vegetable oils with
high saturated fat levels was highest among those who have
heart disease.
    The scientists said more than 50 pct of the fatty acid
content of the tropical oils was saturated, whereas less than
20 pct of the fatty acid content of soybean oil was saturated.
    David Ericksen, director of ASA's technical services, said
U.S. soybean producers could regain about one-half of the 273
mln dlrs in sales lost to imported tropical oils if consumers
were aware the vegetable oils were high in saturated fat.
    Imported tropical oils displace 171 mln bushels of U.S.
soybean sales in the U.S. market, ASA estimates.
    U.S. imports of coconut oil during January totaled 82.9 mln
lbs compared with 48.0 mln lbs in December and 106.5 mln a year
earlier, according to Commerce Department figures.
    Imports of palm oil totaled 44.0 mln lbs compared with 51.3
mln lbs in December and 85.2 mln a year earlier.

Firmer crude oil prices, government aid
packages and corporate spending cuts will help Canada's oil
industry recover from last year sharp downturn, industry
analysts said.
    They said there will be significant earnings gains in 1987
compared to last year's dismal results when oil prices dropped
about 50 pct.
    On Canada's stock exchanges, energy shares have soared to
their highest levels since 1983, with many issues trading at
record highs.
    "This is reflecting a tremendous amount of optimism on the
part of the investment community that the outlook for the
industry for the future is extremely attractive," Peters and Co
Ltd oil analyst Wilf Gobert said.
    Financial statements from Canada's major oil companies,
culminating with Dome Petroleum Ltd's 2.20 billion Canadian dlr
1986 loss reported this week, painted a bleak picture of last
year's results, analysts said.
    "But the financial statements are a snap shot and a
recording of history. The stock market is the indication of the
future," Gobert commented.
    The Toronto Stock Exchange's oil and gas index of 41
companies is up to 4065.4 so far in trading today from 3053.15
at the end of 1986.
    Among Canada's largest oil companies, class A shares of
Imperial Oil Ltd <IMO.A>, 70 pct owned by Exxon Corp <XON>, is
trading at 71, up from a 52-week low of 34-3/4.
    Shell Canada Ltd, 72 pct owned by Royal Dutch/Shell Group,
is at 40-1/2, up from a low during the last year of 18-3/4.
Texaco Canada Inc <TXC>, 78 pct owned by Texaco Inc <TX>, is
at 34-7/8, up from a low of 24-1/2.
    Levesque Beaubien Inc oil analyst Robert Plexman forecasts
operating profit for 10 of Canada's largest oil and gas
companies will rise 37 pct in 1987 to about 1.44 billion dlrs
and operating cash flow will increase 12 pct to 3.24 billion
dlrs, based on an average oil price for the year of 16.50 U.S.
dlrs a barrel. "However, if prices hold about 18 U.S. dlrs a
barrel...1987 net operating income could show a 69 pct increase
with cash flow 27 pct higher," analyst Plexman said.
    "Although it is difficult to forecast the extent of the
profit improvement this year, the gain should be significant,"
he added.
    Those improvements follow a sharp downturn in 1986, when
operating income for the ten companies dropped 47 pct to 1.05
billion dlrs and operating cash flow fell 22 pct to 2.90
billion dlrs.
    But one industry source doesn't think oil prices will hold
recent gains and more government assistance is needed.
    Canadian Petroleum Association technical director Hans
Maciej sees industry cash flow falling another 10 pct in 1987,
after dipping about 60 pct last year. Maciej said he sees crude
oil supply outweighing demand and doesn't believe a recent OPEC
production accord will continue to support prices.
    However, several companies share the optimistic industry
outlook expressed by a majority of analysts.
    Shell Canada and <Norcen Energy Resources Ltd> forecast
improved 1987 earnings in their annual reports issued this
week, assuming oil prices remain at or above 1986 levels.
    "The industry's outlook for 1987 is positive, but not
robust," Texaco Canada said in its annual report.
    "While oil prices have strengthened somewhat and there is
good reason to believe that the general level is sustainable,
continued volatility is likely," Texaco Canada added.
    In the face of short-term uncertainty, many companies have
pared 1987 spending plans from last year's lower levels,
deferring most frontier exploration work.
    "The industry is becoming very selective in investments,
very conservative and cautious, which is not unexpected,"
Canadian Petroleum Association's Maciej said.
    Federal and Alberta goverment aid measures helped cushion
the industry downturn in 1986 and are improving 1987 results.
    The most significant help came last September when the
federal government lifted the 10 pct Petroleum Gas Revenue Tax
(PGRT) 28 months earlier then planned.
    Analysts estimate the tax relief will save larger oil
companies about 1.50 billion dlrs by the end of 1988.
    The PGRT cut helped brake the steep profit and cash flow
decline in 1986 for many oil companies and prevented further
exploration spending cuts, analysts said.
    "For a number of companies, the PGRT cut was absolutely
necessary to even maintain the kind of reduced investments that
were made, otherwise the reduction would have been considerably
more," Maciej said.

Rising demand for U.S. rice may
gradually reduce surpluses while a marketing loan should help
increase the U.S. share of the world rice market despite
sluggish trade this year, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.
    In its quarterly rice outlook and situation summary, the
department said U.S. rice use may surpass production during the
1986/87 marketing year, causing stocks to fall about 10 mln
hundredweight from a year earlier to an estimated 67 mln cwt on
July 31.
    Long grain acreage as a percentage of total acreage is
expected to decline this year, the report said.
    USDA said factors once supportive of increased long grain
acreage have turned around. Domestic prices of medium grain
relative to long grain have increased, the loan differential
has been greatly reduced and increases in long grain yields
relative to those of other classes have leveled off.
    With the drop in domestic prices resulting from the
marketing loan, domestic rice use is expected to grow at a
faster rate, USDA said.
    "Development of new products and increased promotion have
helped make rice more available and visible to a wider range of
consumers," USDA said.
    USDA said world trade is expected to fall in 1987 because
of large production and stocks but a weaker market should
affect competing exporters more than the U.S.
    "The United States has already recovered a substantial share
of the European Community market and made inroads into markets
in the Middle East and Africa," the report said.
    World rice consumption is projected to reach record levels
in 1986/87, the report said, as higher per capita incomes,
increased domestic production and low import prices have
allowed people in many countries to substitute rice for coarse
grains.
    China, India and South Korea have increased output, while
the Middle East and Africa have doubled imports since the
mid-1970s, the report said.

    After Emery made its offer, Hutton extended the deadline on

offer since Emery, an overnight courier, might have an easier
time justifying a lofty price since it would realize cost
savings by combining its business with those of Purolator.

Four U.S. meat processors have asked
the federal government to relax a labelling requirement which
they said discourages the use of mechanically separated meat,
the U.S. Agriculture Department said.
    The petition, filed by Bob Evans Farms, Odom Sausage Co,
Sara Lee Corp and Owens Country Sausage, asks USDA to allow
mechanically separated meat to be listed on product labels as
the species from which it was derived.
    For example, "pork" would be listed on the ingredients
statement instead of "mechanically separated pork."
    Under the petition, the calcium content of the meat product
would have to be stated on the label and the mechanically
separated meat could constitute no more than 10 pct of the meat
and poultry portion of the product.
    Mechanically separated meat is a high-protein, low-cost
product that has been approved for use since 1978, USDA said.
    Current regulations allow use of mechanically separated
ingredients at levels up to 20 pct of the meat and poultry
product, but require it to be listed in the ingredient
statement as "mechanically separated (species)," USDA said.
    USDA said the petitioning firms claimed companies avoid
using mechanically separated meat in their products because the
term carries an "unwarranted negative connotation" in the minds
of many consumers. The petitioners also noted that no similar
regulation exists for poultry products.
    Mechanically separated meat is made by placing carcass
parts, which usually have been hand-trimmed but still have some
remaining meat, into specialized processing equipment.

The Federal Open Market Committee at
its February 10-11 meeting voted nine to one to maintain the
then-existing degree of reserve restraint, minutes showed.
    The FOMC issued an asymmetric inter-meeting policy
directive which gave greater possibility to firmer rather than
easier policy. The Committee set a six to seven pct January
through March annualized growth target for M-2 and M-3 and no
M-1 goal. At the prior meeting in mid-December, the FOMC set a
seven pct target for M-2 and M-3 for November through March.
    The February FOMC kept the four to eight pct Federal funds
rate "reference" range for policy, as in other recent meetings.
    At a telephone conference on February 23, committee members
discussed the possible implications of the decisions reached in
Paris for U.S. intervention in foreign exchange markets. No
conclusions were contained in the minutes.
    In its inter-meeting policy directive, the February FOMC
said that "somewhat greater reserve restraint would, or
slightly lesser reserve restraint might, be acceptable
depending on the behavior of the aggregates, taking into
account the strength of the business expansion, developments in
foreign exchange markets, progress against inflation, and
conditions in domestic and international credit markets."
    The February FOMC voted nine to one for an unchanged
policy. Thomas Melzer, St Louis Federal Reserve Bank president
favored some tightening of reserve conditions.
    He noted the strong growth in bank loans in November
through January and the firm federal funds rate that had
prevailed despite the extraordinary pace of reserve growth. He
also cited the recent declines in the dollar's value.
    Finally, looking ahead, Melzer pointed out the potential
for a further rise in inflationary expectations. He believed
that prompt restraints might avert the need for more
substantial tightening later.
    Regarding inter-meeting policy adjustments, the FOMC
minutes showed, "the members generally felt that policy
implementation should be especially alert to the potential need
for some firming of reserve conditions."
    In this view, the FOMC said somewhat greater reserve
restraint would be warranted if monetary growth did not slow in
line with current expectations and there were concurrent
indications of intensifying inflationary pressures against the
background of stronger economic data.
    One indication of potential price pressure might be a
further tendency for the dollar to weaken.
    The minutes showed that one member, presumably Melzer,
preferred a directive that did not contemplate any easing
during the weeks ahead. However, "most of the members did not
want to rule out the possibility of some slight easing during
the inter-meeting period, although they did not view the
conditions for such a move as likely to emerge."
    The FOMC members assumed that future fluctuations in the
dollar's value would not be of sufficient magnitude to have any
significant effect on the Fed's economic projections. In
addition, they anticipated that considerable progress would be
made in reducing the federal budget deficit.

The U.S. Energy Department issued a
request for proposals to buy the Snettisham Hydroelectric
project, a major part of the Alaska Power Administration.
    It said invitations were sent to two Alaskan electric
utilities, the city and borough of Anchorage and the state of
Alaska.  It did not cite a possible purchase prices.
    The requests were limited to Alaskan entities because the
purpose of privatization of the administration was to put the
local utility into the hands of a local body, the DOE said.
    It added that proposals are due back by August three.
    The DOE said it then had 120 days to select a proposal that
it would recommend to Congress, which then would vote the
recommendation up or down.
    Proposals to buy the other major part of the Alaska Power

Standard and Poor's Corp said that the
credit quality of most U.S. cable television companies is
unlikely to improve in the near term.
    S and P said that after two years and many delays and
disappointments, the cable television industry has firmly
established a net cash generating position.
    However, rather than using their improved position to
decrease the leverage of current capital structures, the
companies' cash flows are being fully leveraged to finance a
wave of consolidations, S and P said.
    Many cable television companies exhibit greater financial
risk because of their asset growth aspirations and
debt-financed consolidation. That delays a lower risk profile
for many of them, Standard and Poor's said.
    The acquisition and financial growth policies of many
company executives heavily influenced the ratings outlook.
    Citing aggressive capital structures, acquisitions and cash
flow coverages of interest expense of between 1.0 and 1.5
times, S and P noted that the companies are more debt intensive
now than in their building phase. These factors keep their
ratings at speculative grades, the agency concluded.

The United States defended its sales
of stockpiled tin in 1986 in reaction to criticism from
Malaysian miners who have said it violated an agreement with
southeast Asian producers.
    "The United States has continued to abide by the spirit of
the memorandum of understanding and has consulted with the
ASEAN states on GSA tin disposals," a State Department spokesman
said in a statement.
    "The views of the ASEAN governments have been taken into
account in determining disposal levels," the statement said.
    The United States and the ASEAN countries signed a
memorandum of understanding concerning tin disposals by the
U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) in December 1983.
    In its latest annual report, the States of Malaya Chamber
of Mines said the GSA sold 5,490 tonnes of tin in 1986, well
above an agreed upon annual limit of 3,000 tonnes. "The United
States appears to have lost sight of the U.S./ASEAN Memorandum
of Understanding," it said.
    The State Department statement said GSA tin disposals
increased in calendar year 1986 due to changed market
conditions. During the first quarter of calendar year 1987,
they have been running at a lower rate compared to 1986.
    The spokesman declined to say how much stockpiled tin the
GSA sold last year, however.

Thayer Bigelow told security analysts.
    He said Scott, Foresman, a textbook publisher, will
contribute more than 50 mln dlrs in operating income before
depreciation and amortization for the full year.
    N.J. Nicholas, president and chief operating officer, said
Soctt Foresman will have over 200 mln dlrs in revenue in 1987.
    Bigelow said the textbook business, which normally has its
highest profit in the third quarter and incurs a loss in the

book publishing income for the first quarter.

effects of financing the acquisition. Bigelow also said the

The U.S. Treasury market ended sharply
higher, reassured by news that the Federal Open Market
Committee voted in February to maintain the then-existing
degree of restraint on bank reserves, dealers said.
    News of a weaker-than-expected March employment report and
a minor bounce back in the dollar prompted short-covering that
pushed coupon issues higher, while an easing in the Federal
funds rate below six pct helped short-dated issues.
    The key 7-1/2 pct 30-year Treasury bond price finished 3/4
higher at 95-27/32, pushing the yield down to 7.86 pct from
7.93 pct yesterday.
    Danuta Zielonka of Wertheim Schroder Co Inc said that
recent slowing in the growth of the monetary aggregates is a
another factor arguing against firmer Fed policy.
    "Money growth has been slowing perceptibly in March which
should give them more room to not tighten," she said. "Both M2
and M3 are will be at the low end of their target ranges in
March."
    "The FOMC minutes are neutral for the bond market,"
Zielonka said. "Dollar considerations will prevent them from
easing anytime soon, but they can't tighten with the economy
weak and the banks having to deal with Brazil."
    Doubts on the economy's strength were underscored not only
by a smaller-than-expected 164,000 gain in March non-farm
payrolls, but also by a downward revision in February's gain to
236,000 from a previously reported 337,000.
    The market's initial reaction to the data was restrained by
fears the employment news would undermine the dollar, but when
the dollar maintained a firm tone, the bond market extended its
gains.
    Profit-taking pulled bond prices down from the day's highs,
but a record close in the U.S. stock market stimulated buying
late in the day that offset this somewhat.
    Still, coupon issues were unable to recover completely from
this week's steep losses as trade tensions between the U.S. and
Japan pressured the dollar and discouraged Japanese investors
from buying U.S. Treasury bonds.
    The current 7-1/2 pct Treasury bond traded down to 94-11/32
in Tokyo this week, pushing the yield to 7.98 pct. This capped
the U.S. 1987 high yield on the 30-year bond of 7.93 pct, seen
yesterday.
    Treasury bills advanced on the week. The six-month bills
rose one basis point, but three-month bills fell 17 basis
points and the year bill fell two basis points.
    Dealers said that the sharp drop in three-month bills
resulted in part from recent outright bill purchases for a
customer, believed to be related to heavy intervention by
foreign central banks to support the dollar.
    A drop in the Fed funds rate to 5-15/16 today underpinned a
decline in bill rates. It traded at this level throughout the
session, down from yesterday's 6.14 pct average.
    Three-month bills closed two basis points lower at 5.48 pct
bid. Six- and 12-month bills both dropped nine basis points to
respective bids of 5.70 pct and 5.75 pct.

Sales of U.S.-built new cars surged
during the last 10 days of March to the second highest levels
of 1987, indicating that car buying may have fully rebounded
from its January slump.
    Sales of imports, meanwhile, fell for the first time in
years, succumbing to price hikes by foreign carmakers.
    For the ten-day March 21-31 period, domestic automakers
sold 282,358 new cars, up 19.3 pct from late March 1986, giving
the industry an annualized sales rate of 8.1 mln cars. That
rate a year ago was 6.9 mln cars.
    "The last 10 days of March was the second strongest 10-day
period we've had this year," said David Healy at Drexel Burnham
Lambert.
    "We've had a slow recovery since January, and these latest
figures build on that. This lends some encouragement to the
idea that we're looking at a pretty strong year," he said.
    In early February sales were up briefly to 8.3 mln units on
an annual basis, before dropping again.
    Car buyers had rushed to dealer showrooms in December to
take advantage of expiring tax deductions, taking away from
normal January selling.
    But a slowly expanding economy, an exploding stock market
and a growing array of incentives have lured customers to
dealers' showrooms, analysts said.
   Ford Motor Co <F> sales jumped 29.5 pct in the period to
79,249 cars from 61,169 a year ago. For the month, the nation's
second largest carmaker said sales increased 17.8 pct to
197,328 compared to 167,490.
    Chrysler Corp <C> reported a 20.2 pct sales jump to 40,454
compared with 33,669. In all of March it sold 96,649, up 6.3
pct from 90,945.
    Industry giant General Motors's sales rose a more modest
6.2 pct for late March to 140,522 verses 132,298 last year. But
sales for the full month dropped 5.6 pct to 349,578 from
370,390.
    Also helping the U.S.-based industry, analysts said, is the
slackening demand for imports, which suffered the first sales
decline in memory.
    "Imports will need more and more sales incentives, a
phenomenon unheard of two years ago," said Scott Merlis at
Morgan Stanley. "Import prices have risen 17 pct on average, so
they've become more sensitive to weaker demand in general."
    General Motors market share for the period fell to 48.2
pct, below the 51 pct for the first three months of the year
and far below the 56 pct of most of last year.
    Ford's market share was 28.1 pct, up from 27.7 pct for the
first three months, while Chrysler's share was 14.3 pct, a rise
from 13.7 pct since the start of the year.
    Falling market share at General Motors apparently prompted
the company to decide this week to close six plants for a week
to bring supply into line with demand.
    But Ronald Glantz at Montgomery Securities said further
production cuts might be necessary.
    "While GM has just taken 100,00 units out of second quarter
production already because of weak sales, the continuation of
this weakening market share suggests another production cutback
is likely," Glantz said.
    Other carmakers with U.S plants posted these results during
the March 21 to 31 period -- American Motors Corp <AMC> 1,198,
down 50 pct, Volkswagen 2,145, down from 3,342, American Honda
16,635, up from 6,358, and Nissan 4,635, up from 2,536.

Sales of U.S.-built new cars surged
during the last 10 days of March to the second highest levels
of 1987, indicating car buying may have fully rebounded from
its January slump.
    Sales of imports, meanwhile, fell for the first time in
years, succumbing to price hikes by foreign carmakers.
    For the ten-day March 21-31 period, domestic automakers

Gulf States Utilities Co said
its condition has "significantly deteriorated" and that its
operating cash reserves will be inadequate by May 1987 unless
it receives additional financing or rate relief from state
public utilities commissions in Texas and Louisiana.
    In the company's newly-released annual report and 10-K
filing, Gulf States said its bank lenders had notified the
utility last month that no additional credit would be granted.
Gulf States said the banks had requested the utility to begin
making prepayments by the end of April of 45 mln dlrs more than
the estimated 1987 lease payments of 40 mln dlrs.
    "The circumstances increase the likelihood that the company
may have to seek protection from its creditors under the
bankruptcy code," Gulf States said.
    The utility had previously said it might be forced to
consider filing for bankruptcy because of limited rate
increases granted by state regulators in connection with Gulf
States' 4.3 billion dlr River Bend nuclear plant in Louisiana.
    "If the regulatory commissions approve the company's
proposed rate moderation plan and grant the increases provided
for in such plan during the initial three-year phase-in period,
the company believes it could achieve financial stability,"
Gulf States said.
    In February, the Texas Public Utilities Commission granted
Gulf States an interim rate increase of 39.9 mln dlrs
contingent upon the utility obtaining a new 250 mln dlr line of
credit to pay operating expenses. The utility had sought 144.1
mln dlrs in rate hikes in Texas.
    Gulf States has appealed a decision by Louisiana state
regulators rejecting its application for 100 mln dlrs in
emergency rate relief.
    In 1986, Gulf States earned 244.9 mln dlrs on revenues of
1.47 billion dlrs, compared to profits of 265.4 mln dlrs on
sales of 1.85 billion in the previous year.

Production in the manufactured goods
industry has been falling since mid-1986 and will decline by
between one and two pct this year after a 2.5 pct increase in
1986, the Ifo economic institute said.
    An Ifo report said recessionary influences were affecting
the engineering industry particularly. It saw a decline of two
to three pct in this sector after a 5.2 pct rise in 1986.
    Orders, especially from abroad, were also falling sharply
for capital goods in the electronics sector, it added.
    Ifo also predicted stagnation in the automobile industry in
1987 after a particularly successful 1986 when production rose
5.1 pct.
    Chemical industry production, which fell by 0.9 pct last
year, was likely to stagnate or decline by one pct in 1987.
This sector suffered from slack demand from abroad and from low
domestic consumption.

Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger has
ordered the U.S. Navy to increase its presence near the Gulf in
an effort to fulfil President Reagan's pledge to keep oil
flowing to Europe and Japan, The New York Times reported.
    The newspaper quoted Pentagon officials as saying the Navy
would keep the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk on station in the
Arabian Sea and the rest of the Indian Ocean until May, three
months longer than planned.
    The Navy would then have a carrier battle group of six to
eight warships in the area at all times rather than part of the
time, as happens now, the paper said.
    The paper said that last month U.S. Intelligence sources
said they had spotted land-based anti-ship missiles of a
Chinese design known in the West as the HY-2 near the Strait of
Hormuz.
    It said their purpose was seen as a signal Iran was ready
to continue and perhaps step up the Gulf shipping war against
Iraq.
    U.S. Carriers or battleships would sail out of range of
those missiles, but within striking distance, the paper quoted
officials as saying.
    From several hundred miles at sea, carriers could launch
aircraft bombing runs or missile strikes, and battleships could
fire long-range missiles, the paper said.

A consortium headed by the construction
group Bouygues SA has been awarded a 50-pct controlling stake
in French state television network TF1, which stock market
analysts said represented a major boost for Bouygues.
    The Bouygues-led consortium was widely regarded as the less
likely of the two candidates in contention to be awarded the
three billion franc stake by the National Commission for
Communications and Liberties (NCCL), the French television
watchdog authority.
    The losing candidate was a consortium headed by publishing
group Hachette SA <HACP.PA>.
    The NCCL decision awarded the Bouygues consortium a 50-pct
controlling stake in a company which will have a 10-year
operating concession for TF1, France's oldest and most widely
watched television network.
    Independent market analysis group C.O.P.S. In a note on
Bouygues said the award would represent a major diversification
for the group out of the highly cyclical construction industry
into the rapidly expanding media business.
    Bouygues in February said it estimated 1986 group net
attributable profit at 480 mln francs, up from 443 mln for
1985, on consolidated turnover of 45.8 billion francs, up from
26.3 billion.
    The sharp rise in turnover reflected the groups acquisition
of the loss-making SCREG construction group last year.
    Bouygues closed on the Paris stock market at 1,451 francs
on Friday, up from 1,405 the previous day, but well below its
year's high of 1,475.
    Hachette closed at 3,280, up from a previous 3,250.
    Bouygues holds a 50-pct stake in the winning consortium,
giving it a 25-pct stake in TF1.
    The U.K.-based <Pergamon Media Trust> of Robert Maxwell has
a 20-pct stake in the consortium, representing a 10 pct stake
in TF1, while <Maxwell Media France> has a six pct stake, or
three pct of the television network.

Growth in oil consumption in the Western
industrialised countries is likely to slow to around one pct
this year compared with 2.3 pct in 1986, the International
Energy Agency (IEA) said.
    Oil use in the 24 countries of the OECD increased by around
one pct in first quarter 1987 to 35.9 mln bpd, the IEA said in
its Monthly Oil Market Report.
    Growth in OECD countries is expected to come primarily from
transport fuels, as in 1986. But if average consumer prices are
higher than 1986, the rate of growth for these fuels may be
below last year's 3.6 pct, it said.
    The IEA said that assuming crude oil and product prices
stay close to current levels, some destocking by end-users can
be expected. If that happens, natural gas will also regain some
of the market share it lost to heavy fuel in 1986, and there
may be slightly less growth in transport fuels.
    IEA estimates on April 1 put oil stocks in the OECD area at
428 mln tonnes, representing 98 days of forward consumption.
This is about the same level as at the begining of the year.
    The agency said this flat trend is explained by the
projected seasonal consumption decline in the second quarter of
the year which offset a reduction in stocks.
    It said initial estimates indicate that company stocks fell
by 1.2 mln bpd in OECD countries in the first quarter of the
year. This followed a small rise in January of 0.4 mln bpd but
a decline of 1.5 mln bpd in February and 2.5 mln bpd in March.
    It is possible that final data will show a larger draw,
particulary for March, it said. As crude production also fell,
there is likely to have also been a decline in non-reported
stocks, particularly at sea, the IEA said.
    Company stocks on land in the OECD rose to 326 mln tonnes
on April 1 against 316 mln on April 1 1986. Governments built
up strategic stocks to 102 mln tonnes against 97 mln in the
period.
    The year-on-year trend of government stock building is
continuing with year-on-year company stocks also rising, more
or less in line with consumption, after declining for five
years, the IEA noted.
    Oil stocks on land in the U.S. And Canada were put at 206.6
mln tonnes on April 1, down from the 214 mln tonnes on January
1 and equivalent to 94 and 98 days of consumption,
respectively.
    Oil stocks in Western Europe were 147.4 mln tonnes on April
1, down from the 154 mln on January 1 but still equivalent to
94 days of consumption.
    World oil supply fell in the first quarter by about two mln
bpd to 45.2 mln bpd from 47.2 mln bpd in last quarter 1986.
    This drop was mostly due to a decline in OPEC crude
production to around 15.5 mln bpd in February/March from 16.5
mln bpd in January and to the seasonal drop in exports from
centrally-planned Economies, the IEA said.
    Total OPEC crude oil supply was 15.8 mln bpd in the first
quarter, plus 1.4 mln bpd of NGLs, compared with 17.3 mln bpd
of crude in the last three months of 1986 and 17.9 mln average
for the whole of 1986. Supply from non-OPEC countries totalled
28 mln bpd, against 28.5 mln bpd in the fourth quarter 1986.
    A drop in Saudi Arabian output to a tentatively forecast
3.3 mln bpd in March from 3.6 mln bpd in February was the
largest factor behind the OPEC production decline, the IEA
said.
    Saudi Arabia"s Opec-assigned output quota is 4.133 mln bpd.

West Germany's Christian Democrats (CDU)
and their liberal Free Democrat Party (FDP) allies today won
control of the central state of Hesse in state elections,
toppling the Social Democrats (SPD) who had governed the state
for over 40 years.
    The CDU/FDP coalition will have a two-seat majority over
the SPD and their Greens party allies in the new state
parliament. Earlier predictions forecast a hung parliament.
    The poll was the first major test of public opinion since
national elections last January returned Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's CDU-dominated coalition to power in Bonn.
    Political commentators said the result was a debacle for
the SPD, which has been split by disagreements over the party's
future direction. It was also a rebuff for a unique coalition
the SPD had formed in Hesse with the anti-nuclear Greens
movement, which left-wing Social Democrats said could provide a
model for a similar alliance at federal level.
    Bonn Environment Minister Walter Wallmann, the CDU's
victorious candidate for the state premiership, told reporters
"Many traditional SPD voters voted for us because they did not
want an SPD that was under the influence of the Greens."

The U.S. economy in March improved at a
faster rate than in February, with the National Association of
Purchasing Management's composite index rising to 53.9 pct from
51.9 pct, the NAPM said.
    The first quarter average for the index also was 53.9 pct.
The NAPM said that, if this average were to continue for the
rest of 1987, it would be consistent with real gross national
product growth of about three pct.
    An index reading above 50 pct generally indicates that the
economy is in an expanding phase. One below 50 pct implies a
declining economy.
    The NAPM said the economic improvement was evident in all
of the indicators in the index except inventories, which
declined slightly.
    New orders rose sharply in March, with production also
higher. Vendor deliveries slowed, another sign that the economy
improved in March. Employment expanded for the first time since
August 1984.
    Robert Bretz, chairman of the NAPM's business survey
committee and director of materials management at Pitney Bowes
Inc <PBI> said "the economy ended the first quarter with a
healthy, if not substantial improvement."
    Bretz said the sharp rise in the growth of new orders in
March assures a good beginning for the second quarter.
    Some 50 pct of the purchasing managers reported that they
were paying higher prices in March than at the end of 1986. Of
those paying higher prices now, the average increase was put at
2.5 pct.
    The estimated average price increase anticipated by members
for the remainder of 1987 is 2.1 pct. While prices continue to
rise, the NAPM said that most purchasers do not see them as
being significant.
    The composite index is a seasonally adjusted figure, based
on five components of the NAPM business survey - new orders,
production, vendor deliveries, inventories and employment.
    The monthly report is based on questions asked of
purchasing managers at 250 U.S. industrial companies.

Public opinion polls showing a surge in
support for British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher following
her trip to Moscow have raised the possibility she will call a
spring election, political analysts said.
    A poll in today's Daily Express showed 39 pct support for
the ruling Conservative party, 30 pct for the Alliance of
Liberals and Social Democrats and 29 pct for the Labour party.
    Reproduced in a general election, the result would give
Thatcher an overall parliamentary majority of 22.
    A poll in yesterday's Sunday Times gave the Conservatives
41 pct support, 12 percentage points ahead of both opposition
groups -- their biggest lead in three-and-a-half years.
    Conservative sources have said Thatcher would prefer a
series of polls giving her party over 40 pct of the vote,
securing it a clear parliamentary majority, before announcing
the date for the next election.
    Lord Whitelaw, Conservative leader in the House of Lords
and one of Thatcher's closest advisors, yesterday ruled out a
May general election, but left open the choices of June and
early autumn.
    The Sunday Times poll, taken during Thatcher's visit to
Moscow last week, was the first to show the party breaking
through 40 pct.
    The Express poll was the first since Thatcher's trip to
Moscow, hailed as a triumph by the British media. It confirmed
a number of recent surveys suggesting that the Alliance had
overtaken Labour.
    Thatcher, currently serving her second consecutive term of
office, does not have to call elections until June 1988 but is
widely expected to do so within the next six months.

U.S. Bond trading is likely to remain
cautious in the near term with a possible downward price bias
as market participants focus on trends in the dollar, the
economy and Federal Reserve policy, economists said.
    Most expect the economy to continue showing modest gains,
that the dollar has more room to fall and that the Fed will
keep policy essentially steady, perhaps for several months.
    Until trends are clearer, "the market can only attempt to to
establish and hold a new trading range at higher interest
rates," said economists at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
    Merrill Lynch economists Raymond Stone and Ward McCarthy
said that while the fundamentals generally bode for a healthy
investment climate, the market will have no confidence in this
environment until there is illumination of and confidence in
U.S. Dollar/trade policy.
    Salomon Brothers' Henry Kaufman said the bond market,
highly sensitized to dollar movements, could be encouraged if
currency markets seem to be stabilizing or if U.S. And overseas
economic growth is perceived as slowing sharply.
    "The crucial question, however, is how soon either of these
developments is likely to occur," Kaufman said.
    "Market uncertainties and the erosion of portfolio manager
confidence could continue portfolio selling pressure a while
longer," said Philip Braverman, chief economist at Irving
Securities Corp.
    However, Braverman said that, "from a longer term
perspective, current (bond) prices provide a buying
opportunity."
    Despite a nearly one-point bond price rebound Friday on
unexpectedly weak March employment data, key 30-year Treasury
bonds lost 2-1/4 points in price for the week as a whole and
Thursday's 7.93 pct closing yield was a 1987 high.
    Braverman said historical evidence suggests that a long
bond yield in the 7.93 pct area provides a basis for optimism.
Bonds closed at 7.86 pct on Friday.
    The Irving economist noted that three times last year, in a
similar "paroxysm of pessimism," the key bonds reached a similar
closing yield high. Within three to six weeks in each instance,
however, Braverman said bond prices recovered to bring the
yield down sharply by 63 to 82 basis points.
    Mitchell Held of Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co Inc said
that many portfolio managers now believe yields could approach
nine pct by midyear, which he considers unlikely.
    Held said that, since late 1986, Smith Barney analysts have
spoken about the risk that interest rates could move higher and
they continue to believe that an upward bias is likely to
persist over the next few months.
    Held said that in conversations with portfolio managers
last week there appeared to be increasing belief that the rate
rise had just begun and that yields could approach nine pct by
midyear. Naturally, that would mean a sharp bond price fall.
    "Yields could rise further over the next few months, but the
rise should be less than the 65 basis point rise we've seen
since the start of the year," Held said.
    Most expect Fed policy to be neutral for bonds near term.
    "The Fed is currently frozen into a fixed stance," said
economists at Aubrey G. Lanston and Co Inc.
    They said the Fed cannot tighten policy and push up
interest rates as might be appropriate to stabilize the dollar
and head off renewed inflationary psychology. That might harm
the fragile U.S. Economic expansion.
    The Lanston economists said, "The Fed cannot ease its policy
stance to both foster more rapid economic growth and calm
domestic and Third World debt jitters without the threat of
causing a further decline in the dollar."
    Minutes of February's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)
meeting released Friday showed that while the FOMC left policy
unchanged it was more inclined to firm rather than ease policy
later if conditions in the economy, foreign exchange or credit
markets warranted a policy shift.
    However, economists generally believe that continued fairly
sluggish U.S. Economic growth and the financial strains on U.S.
Banks resulting from their problem loans to developing
countries rule out any Fed policy firming.
    There is broad agreement among economists that the FOMC at
last Tuesday's meeting also left Fed policy unchanged.
    This week's U.S. Economic data are expected to have little
impact. February consumer instalment credit numbers are due on
Wednesday, with March producer price data out Friday.
    There may be mild relief in some quarters that the U.S.
Purchasing Managers Composite Index, a closely-watched economic
indicator, rose only to 53.9 pct in March from 51.9 pct. A
Friday rumor had put the number far higher. The index's first
quarter average also was 53.9 pct, translating into real GNP
growth of about three pct if continued through 1987.
    Federal funds traded at 5-15/16 pct late Friday and are
expected to open about there today with no Fed action seen.

Caesars World Inc <CAW> said its
directors unanimously approved a recapitalization plan under
which stockholders will get a cash distribution of 25 dlrs per
share via a one-time special cash dividend and will retain
their common stock ownership in Caesars World.
    Caesars World said it expects to raise the approximately
one billion dlrs needed to pay the 25 dlr per share dividend
and the expenses of recapitalization through around 200 mln
dlrs in bank borrowings and a public sale of approximately 800
mln dlrs of debt. Some outstanding debt will be retired.
    Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc, Caesars' financial advisor, has
told the company it is confident it can arrange the entire
financing needed for the recapitalization.
    Henry Gluck, chairman and chief executive officer of the
hotel, casino and resorts company, said in a statement the
board believes the recapitalization plan is financially
superior to a 28 dlr a share tender offer by Martin Sosnoff.
    Gluck said the Caesars World board once again recommends
that shareholders reject the Sosnoff offer.
    The stock closed at 29.25 dlrs a share on Friday.
    "Our ability to restructure along these lines is possible
primarily because of the financial stability and the strong
operating results achieved by management in recent years," Gluck
said.
    He said that after the recapitalization takes effect,
proforma net income for the fiscal year ended July 31, 1988 is
expected to be about 28.7 mln dlrs.
    Fiscal 1988 primary earnings per share are projected to be
76 cents, based on about 37.8 mln in post-recapitalization
common and common-equivalent shares outstanding.
    Commenting on the company's longer term earnings outlook,
Gluck said "we project net income to increase to 86.2 mln dlrs
in 1992, reflecting increased operating income and lower
interest expense due to the retirement of 267 mln dlrs of debt
incurred in connection with the recapitalization."
    He said the company does not usually release projections,
but has done so now beause of the significance of the
recapitalization.
    Gluck said the recapitalization plan will be submitted for
stockholder approval at a special meeting expected in June.
    The plan will require the approval of stockholders and that
of the Nevada and New Jersey gaming regulatory authorities.
    As part of the plan, the company will change its state of
incorporation from Florida to Delaware by means of a merger of
Caesars World into a wholly owned subsidiary of the company.
    The new incorporation certificate and bylaws will provide
for, among other things, a "fair price" provision requiring that
certain transactions with interested 15 pct stockholders be
approved by an 80 pct vote of stockholders, excluding shares
held by such interested stockholders.
    Caesars World said in a statement that "the cash
distribution will result in a substantial deficit in
stockholders' equity." It did not give an estimate of the size

Growth in oil consumption in the Western
industrialized countries is likely to slow to around one pct
this year compared with 2.3 pct in 1986, the International
Energy Agency said.
    Oil use in the 24 member countries of the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) increased by around
one pct in the first quarter of 1987 to 35.9 mln barrels a day,
the IEA said in its latest monthly report.
    Growth in OECD countries is expected to come primarily from
transport fuels, as was the case in 1986. But if average
consumer prices are higher than 1986, the rate of growth for
these fuels may be below last year's 3.6 pct.
    The IEA said assuming crude and product prices remain nar
current levels, some destocking by end-users can be expected.
    If that takes place, natural gas will also regain some of
the market share it lost to heavy fuel in 1986, it said.
    IEA estimates on April one put oil stocks held in the OECD
area at 428 mln tonnes, or 98 days of forward consumption. This
is about the same as at the begining of the year.
    The agency said this flat trend is explained by the
projected seasonal consumption decline in the second quarter of
the year which offset a reduction in stocks.
    Company stocks on land in the OECD rose to 326 mln tonnes
on April one this year compared with 316 mln tonnes in calender
1986 while governments also built up their strategic stocks to
102 mln tonnes against 97 mln in 1986.
    The year-on-year trend of government stock building is
continuing with company stocks rising, more or less in line
with consumption, after declining for five years, IEA said.
    Oil stocks on land in the United States and Canada were put
at 206.6 mln tonnes down from the 214 mln tonnes on January one
and equivalent to 94 and 98 days of consumption, respectively.
    Oil stocks in Western Europe were 147.4 mln tonnes, down
from the 154 mln tonnes on January one but still equivalent to
94 days of consumption.
    The IEA said that initial estimates indicate that company
stocks fell by 1.2 mln bpd in OECD countries in the first
quarter of the year. This followed a small rise in January of
400,000 bpd but a decline of 1.5 bpd in February and 2.5 bpd in
March.
    And it is possible that final data will show a larger draw,
particulary for March, it said.
    As crude production also fell, there is likely to have also
been a decline in non-reported stocks, particularly at sea, the
IEA said.
    World oil supply fell through the first quarter by about
two bpd to 45.2 bpd from 47.5 bpd in the last quarter of 1986.
    This drop was mostly due to a decline in OPEC crude
production to around 15.5 bpd in February/March from 16.5 bpd
in January and to the seasonal drop in exports from Centrally
Planned Economies, the IEA said.
    Total OPEC oil supply totalled 17.2 bpd in the first
quarter of 1987 compare with 19.3 bpd in the last three months
of 1986 while supply from non-OPEC countries totalled 28 bpd as
against 28.2 bpd in the same 1986 period.
    A drop in Saudi Arabian output to a tentatively forecast
3.3 bpd in march from 3.6 bpd in February was the largest
factor behind the OPEC production decline, the IEA said.

Japanese oil traders generally expect oil
prices to remain steady through June, when the next
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' (Opec) meeting
is scheduled to take place.
    Prices have kept to a narrow trading range for more than a
month, despite coming under considerable pressure in February
as Japanese oil companies holding high oil stocks strongly
resist paying official prices, trade sources said.
    Despite these attempts, spot crude rose steadily to
stabilize around OPEC's 18 dlr a barrel target, they said.
    Spot prices fell more than two dlrs during the month,
mainly on market assumptions Opec was producing more than its
15.8 mln barrel a day (bpd) self-imposed ceiling and members
would submit to pressure to discount prices, oil traders said.
    However, Opec's discipline in holding its price and output
targets eventually forced many of the buyers back, they said.
    Countries such as Qatar, Iran and Iraq refused to bend to
demands for lower prices in spite of threats of non-lifting
from Japanese buyers.
    The solidarity of Opec encouraged Qatar to charter vessels
to store its production rather than cut its prices, they said.
    Opec's March production was 14.6 mln bpd, 1.2 mln below its
ceiling, with Saudi Arabia's output just below 3.0 mln bpd
compared to its Opec quota of 4.133 mln bpd, the Middle East
Economic Survey estimated.
    "Of course there was a little cheating but not enough to
destroy the market," an oil trader in Tokyo said.
    Opec crudes have been appearing on the spot market at
discounted prices through barter deals and the swapping of
Middle East grades for North Sea cargoes, but these trades have
not generated sufficient volume to depress the market, he said.
    The current spot values of Middle East grades are only 20
to 25 cts below official prices, so resistance to buying crude
under term contracts in the second quarter is likely to be
weaker, traders said.
    Indonesia's Minister of Energy and Mines Subroto said today
OPEC faces the choice of either maintaining present output
volume at 15.8 mln bpd and seeing prices increase slightly, or
raising the production ceiling so members can produce more in
the third and fourth quarters of 1987.

The ruling Liberal Democratic Party has
drawn up the guidelines of an economic package including a
supplementary budget of more than 5,000 billion yen, a senior
party official said.
    It also urged the government to concentrate in the first
half of the current fiscal year which began on April 1 a record
proportion of the year's public works spending, he said.
    The LDP also suggested the government review the ceiling on
budgetary requests for investment in public works projects
presented by individual ministries, he added.
    But the LDP official said the government should not abandon
its fiscal reform target of ending the issue of
deficit-covering bonds by fiscal 1990.
    These measures should be treated as an emergency, partly
because of the urgent need for Japan to redress its external
trade imbalance with the U.S., He said.
    The guidelines will be explained to the U.S. This week when
Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa visits Washington for the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) meeting, he added.
    The official, the LDP Policy Affairs Research Council's
Chairman Masayoshi Ito, told a press conference the proposed
supplementary budget will probably be compiled no earlier than
August but before November.
    The guideline will be the basis for a more detailed
reflationary plan to be worked out by the LDP before Prime
Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone leaves for Washington on April 29
for talks with President Reagan, Ito said.
    The full government-endorsed economic package is expected
to be announced in late May.
    The LDP expects public works spending in the first 1987/88
half to account for more than 80 pct of what was originally
incorporated in the fiscal 1987 budget, Ito said. The previous
record for the rate was 77.5 pct in 1986/87.
    Ito said revenue sources for the additional pump-priming
measures should include the issue of construction bonds and the
use of part of the proceeds from sales of the privatized Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone Corp stocks.
    An LDP statement said the government should use the
additional budget mainly to encourage housing construction and
to revitalize regional economies hit hard by the yen's rise.

West German banking regulations must be
expanded to cover off-balance sheet risks arising from new
financing forms, Federal Banking Supervisory Office President
Wolfgang Kuntze said.
    Kuntze told bankers at a reception that deals for hedging
price risks are not covered by current supervisory rules.
    Such deals could be used for speculation and do not have to
be disclosed.
    Kuntze also said it must be considered whether banks can
continue not to set shareholders' equity and reserves against
their own holdings of securities.
    Since early 1984, banks have been limited to lending 18
times shareholders' equity and reserves on a consolidated basis
and Bundesbank officials have said that interest rate and
currency swaps and currency options are under scrutiny.
    Authorities favour reinterpreting the banking law to fit
present circumstances in order to avoid the long parliamentary
political process of changing it, banking sources said.
    Kuntze said solutions to the problem of banking supervision
can be found without having to change the law again.
    The risk structure in banking is moving away from the model
on which banking supervisory rules are based, Kuntze said.
    Banking supervisors are still firemen with a safety net but
the safety net has become a little too small, he said.
    Kuntze declined to detail possible changes to banking
regulations, as these are still the subject of discussions
between the Supervisory Office and the Bundesbank.
    He said he sees no chance in the foreseeable future for an
international harmonisation of supervisory law and the German
supervisory office would not wait for such harmonisation.
    Nor would it get involved in international competition on
minimal regulatory standards in order to shield banks from
competitive disadvantages, he said.

Electrical appliance maker Moulinex
<MOUP.PA> said industrial director Roland Darneau had been
nominated as general manager of the group.
    Darneau's appointment, if confirmed by the Moulinex board
on April 16, effectively names him as successor to 87-year-old
Moulinex group President Jean Mantelet, industry analysts said.
    The company declined to comment on press reports that
Moulinex recorded a loss of between 200 mln and 250 mln francs
in 1986, or that this would be offset by Mantelet personally
injecting 200 mln francs.
    Company sources said earlier this year that the group was
likely to increase its net consolidated losses to 200 mln
francs in 1986 from 34.9 mln in 1985.
    Moulinex has implemented a restructuring programme,
including plans to cut jobs, to improve its results.

London's soft futures markets, namely

uniform presentation on their respective open positions
referring to previous day's trading figures, a spokeswoman for
the London Commodity Exchange (LCE) said.
    The figures represent total clients' long positions as well
as short positions, plus the net house positions as submitted
by all members for each delivery month, she said.
    As a result, figures will differ from those previously
published but are hoped to be more accurate and to compare more

    Since the introduction of a revised clearing procedure last

The British Petroleum <BP.L> Co Plc's
refinery at Grangemouth, Scotland, shut down after an explosion

barrels per day (bpd) capacity, as work on overhauling the
North Side of the complex, which began at the end of January,
will not be completed before the end of April.
    He said the refinery had been closed for longer than

The ruling Liberal Democratic Party has
drawn up the guidelines of an economic package including a
supplementary budget of more than 5,000 billion yen, a senior
party official said.
    The official, the LDP Policy Affairs Research Council's
Chairman Masayoshi Ito, told a press conference the proposed
supplementary budget will probably be compiled no earlier than
August but before November.
    It also urges the government to concentrate in the first
half of the current fiscal year which began on April 1 a record
proportion of the year's public works spending.
    The guidelines will be explained to the U.S. this week when
Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa visits Washington for the
meetings with the IMF and G-7 ministers, Ito added.
    The LDP suggested the government review the ceiling on
budgetary requests for investment in public works projects
presented by individual ministries, Ito said.
    But the LDP official said the government should not abandon
its fiscal reform target of ending the issue of
deficit-covering bonds by fiscal 1990.
    These measures should be treated as an emergency, partly
because of the urgent need for Japan to redress its external
trade imbalance with the U.S., He said.
    The guideline will be the basis for a more detailed
reflationary plan to be worked out by the LDP before Prime
Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone leaves for Washington on April 29
for talks with President Reagan, Ito said.
    The full government-endorsed economic package is expected
to be announced in late May.
    The LDP expects public works spending in the first 1987/88
half to account for more than 80 pct of what was originally
incorporated in the fiscal 1987 budget, Ito said. The previous
record for the rate was 77.5 pct in 1986/87.
    Ito said revenue sources for the additional pump-priming
measures should include the issue of construction bonds and the
use of part of the proceeds from sales of the privatized Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone Corp stocks.
    An LDP statement said the government should use the
additional budget mainly to encourage housing construction and
to revitalize regional economies hit hard by the yen's rise.

The European <Airbus Industrie> consortium
is to change the lead engine on its A-340 aircraft because the
high-technology superfan engine will not be ready by 1992, a
company spokesman said.
   Airbus has chosen the Franco-U.S. CFM-56-S3 engines to
replace the <International Aero Engine> (IAE) consortium's
superfan. The spokesman added the new engine, to be produced by
General Electric Co of the U.S. And SNECMA of France, can
provide greater thrust than the IAE rival.
    The spokesman said the IAE consortium, which includes Pratt
and Whitney of the U.S. And Britain's <Rolls Royce>, is unable
to supply its superfan engines in time for mid-1992 when the
A-340 is due to become operational.
    Airbus signed an agreement with IAE last December,
replacing an earlier accord with GE and <SNECMA>, whose CFM-56
engine could then offer no more than a 28,600 lbs thrust,
compared to the proposed superfan's 30,000 lbs.
    The latest version of the CFM-56, however, can provide a
30,600 lbs thrust.
    The Airbus spokesman said the consortium's decision did not
exclude the IAE superfan, once ready, being offered as an
alternative engine on the A-340 as the superfan was more
fuel-efficient than the CFM engine.
    The spokesman said Airbus expected IAE to come back with
some proposals on superfan's new production timetable within
the next few weeks or months.

Emery Air Freight Corp said it has
entered into an agreement with E.F. Hutton Group Inc EFH under
which Hutton will terminate its merger agreement with Purolator
Courier Corp and its pending 35-dlr-per-share tender offer,
effective April 13.
    Under its merger agreement, Hutton has the right to
unilaterally terminate the merger agreement under certain
circumstances, including its receipt of less than 66-2/3 pct of
Purolator shares or the start of a higher competing tender
offer, such as Emery's competing 40 dlr per share offer for
Purolator stock.
    Yesterday, Hutton's PC Acquisition Corp subsidiary extended
its tender offer, which was to have expired at midnight, for
two more days.  It said it only about 450,000 shares, or 6.5
pct, of Purolator shares had been tendered and not withdrawn,
down from an 11.5 pct interest held earlier.
    Emery's bid expires April 28.
    Emery said pending the termination of PC Acquisition's
merger agreement, PC has released Purolator from an agreement
not to discuss Emery's acquisition proposal with Emery. Emery
said as a result it is renewing its request that Purolatr enter
into merger negotiations with it.
    Emery said if it were to acquire 51 pct of Purolator shares
or control of the Purolator board, it has agreed not to dispute
PC Acquisition's right to receive fees that Purolator agreed to
pay if PC were unsuccessful in acquiring control of Purolator
due to the acquisition of control by another party.
    The company said it has also agreed to let Purolator pay
all of PC Acquisition's documented expenses in connection with
the merger agreement up to three mln dlrs and Emery has agreed
to pay the amounts itself should Purolator fail to do so.

Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul
Volcker said a further large drop in the value of the dollar
could be counterproductive for world economic growth.
    Testifying before the Senate Banking Committee, Volcker
said that Europe and Japan were slowing exports and that growth
in those countries was also decreasing.
    "In that kind of situation, further sizeable depreciation
of the dollar could well be counterproductive," he said.
    Domestic expansion in foreign industrial countries has not
been enough to offset the effects of slower exports, Volcker
said.
    On the value of the dollar, Volcker said he could not say
whether it should be higher or lower to restore balance in
trade.
    "What we do know is that a substantial exchange rate
adjustment has already been made," he said.
    "That adjustment should be large enough, in a context of a
growing world economy and fiscal restraint in the United
States, to support the widespread expectations of a narrowing
in the real trade deficit in the period ahead," he said.
    Volcker said U.S. exports were now growing substantially
while import growth should slow.
    Volcker said that to improve the trade deficit with a
minimum of inflationary pressure, the United States would have
to slow its spending growth.
    It would also have to achieve a better balance between
investment and domestic savings if it wants to be able to
dispense with foreign capital.
    "The constructive way to work in the needed direction would
be to reduce our budget deficit, year by year, paving the way
for improvements in our trade accounts," he said.
    Relying on depreciation of the dollar alone would risk
renewed inflation, he said.

Marion Laboratories Inc's stock rose
sharply today after the company presented a bullish earnings
scenario at a meeting for pharmaceutical analysts Monday,
traders and analysts said.
    The company said it expects earnings for fiscal 1987,
ending June 30, to rise more than 75 pct over a year ago.
    That pronouncement encouraged analyst David Crossen of
Sanford C. Bernstein and Co to raise his earnings estimates for
the company to 1.28 dlrs a share in 1987, compared to his
previous estimate of 1.20 dlrs a share. Last year the company
earned 70 cts a share.
    Marion's stock gained 3-1/4 to 75-1/2.
    At the meeting of pharmaceutical analysts, Marion's
president Fred Lyons Jr. said Wall Street eanrings estimates of
1.10-1.15 dlrs a share for fiscal 1987 "are expected to cause
even the aggressive side of this range to be 10 to 15 cts low."
    Lyons said the strong performance in the second half of
this year will result from the fourth quarter introduction of
90 mg and 120 mg Cardizem tablets. Analyst Crossen said that
Cardizem, which treats angina, is also expected to be approved
for the treatment of hypertension by the end of the year.
    Crossen said "because Marion is still just a small company,
the growth of Cardizem is having a big impact on the bottom
line." He raised fiscal 1988 earnings estimates to 2.15 dlrs a
share from his previous estimate of 2.05 dlrs a share.
    "The company has a broad new product pipeline in the
industry and as far as I am concerned, it is the most
innovative company in the business," he said.
    For the five years through 1991, Crossen expects Marion to
have a growth rate of 55 pct.

Bundesbank council member Lothar
Mueller said the bank has not given up its money supply policy
and that restraining money supply growth does not always mean
pushing up interest rates.
    Mueller said in an article for the Boersen Zeitung
financial daily that a monetary policy which took into account
exchange rate expectations and capital flows could not be
confused with an exchange rate oriented policy.
    The article followed international press speculation that
the Bundesbank had abandoned money supply targetting in favour
of an exchange rate policy.
    Mueller, a member of the Bundesbank council in his position
as president of the regional state central bank in Bavaria,
noted that the Bundesbank's decision in January to cut leading
interest rates amid continuing strong monetary growth had led
some people to think it was dropping monetary targetting.
    "Simply to ignore the external economic context would be
risky and dangerous for monetary policy," he explained.
    Mueller said the cuts in official interest rates had put an
end to interest rate speculation. The Bundesbank could now
assume that upward pressure on the mark would ease and currency
inflows slow down.
    Lower money market rates, achieved by widening short and
long term interest rate differentials, also encouraged
investors to re-invest funds parked in liquid accounts, Mueller
said.
    The measures therefore aimed clearly at bringing monetary
growth back onto the desired path, he said.
    "Finally, of course, and there is no need to keep this
quiet, the cut in interest rates was also in line with the
changed economic situation of the last few months," he added.
    "All in all, the Bundesbank in no way abandoned its money
supply policy with the January discount rate cut, despite
suppositions to the contrary," Mueller said.
    "Keeping money supply developments in check is not always
synonymous with raising interest rates, especially when
excessive liquidity due to inflows from abroad, rather than
growth in bank credits, is the cause of rising monetary
holdings of non-banks," Mueller said.
    Now that West Germany no longer ran large external deficits
other concepts were needed for monetary policy.
    Mueller said it would be both difficult and dangerous for
monetary policy to pursue a specific mark/dollar exchange rate.
    In any case, the exchange rate partly depends on U.S.
Currency and budgetary policy and the U.S. Economy, he said.
    But an exchange rate orientation would also mean the end of
a strict stability policy because both interest rates and
liquidity would be affected by required currency intervention
and could no longer be steered autonomously by the Bundesbank.
    Even interest rates are not in the centre of the
Bundesbank's considerations, but reflect competition and other
market conditions, Mueller said.
    A cut in bank liquidity will not directly influence central
bank money stock, the Bundesbank's main money supply indicator.
    This does not reflect banking liquidity, but the liquidity
of industry and households which cannot be directly reached
with the Bundesbank's instruments, Mueller said.
    The less dependent non-banks are on bank credits, the
harder it is to steer money supply. This has increasingly been
the case recently, because non-banks have received considerable
sums from current account surpluses and capital imports.
    "If the Bundesbank had tried to brake the money supply rise
with higher interest rates, as would have been appropriate if
credit was growing excessively, it would not only have missed
its target but probably even set off further inflows," he said.
    Mueller said growth in money supply was still too high.
    In the last three months money stock grew at an annual rate
of seven pct, down from 10 pct in the previous quarter.
    The growth curve has therefore come closer to the three to
six pct 1987 target corridor for central bank money stock
growth, pointing to the success of the current policy, he said.
    But high monetary stocks can be a warning sign and there
should be no change in priorities. "Monetary policy must be
first and foremost stability policy and successful stability
policy is money supply policy -- nothing else," he said.

State-owned engine maker <Rolls Royce
Plc> launches its prospectus for privatisation tomorrow with
many analysts forecasting higher profits this year. But it is
likely to miss contracts to power the proposed <Airbus
Industrie> A340 aircraft.
    The company's so-called "pathfinder prospectus" gives all the
details of its stock market flotation except for the price at
which shares will be offered.
    Last month, the company announced that pretax profits rose
in 1986 to 120 mln stg from 81 mln the year before.
    Brokers Barclays de Zoete Wedd, BZW, sees 155 mln profit
for 1987.
    Analyst Tim Harris of Phillips and Drew said rising profits
and a low tax charge would be offset by the fact that Rolls
operated in a sector which traditionally attracted low ratings.
    Assuming the company was valued at around eight times
earnings, this would give a selling price valuing it at about
1.2 billion, though he said the recent good performance of the
aerospace sector could nudge this figure upwards.
    BZW is currently forecasting a higher sale price at between
1.5 billion and 1.7 billion.
    The price will be increased by it being likely to have much
of its debt wiped off by a government anxious to assure the
company's health when it has to fend for itself. Rolls was
rescued from bankruptcy and taken into state ownership in 1971.
    When the government announced the sale, it said it would
inject permanent capital equivalent to net debt -- around 250
mln stg at end-1986 -- into the company.
    Analysts noted this was necessary to ensure Rolls a credit
rating to match those of its main competitors such as General
Electric Co <GE.N> and United Technologies Corp's <UTX.N> Pratt
and Whitney unit.

As pressure mounted on British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher to call a June election, she said
today that the decision on when to go to the county was hers
and hers alone.
    She was speaking to parliament after senior members of the
ruling Conservative Party urged her to call elections due in
June 1988 a year early in the wake of two more opinion polls
giving her party a commanding lead.
    Asked by a Conservative back-bencher for an assurance that
the decision was hers alone, and did not depend on "media hype,
pressure and speculation," she replied: "The date of the next
election will be decided by Downing Street, not Fleet Street."
    Downing Street is the Prime Minister's official residence,
Fleet Street the traditional home of the British national
press.
    A Harris poll for the breakfast-time program TV-AM gave the
Tories 43 pct of the vote, representing a majority of 132 seats
in parliament, their biggest lead since the party's landslide
victory in the 1983 elections.
    In The Times of London, a MORI poll gave the Tories a 92
seat majority. It was the sixth poll to show the ruling party
with a big lead over the opposition Labour Party and the
fast-improving centrist Alliance.
    Leading the chorus urging Thatcher to go to the polls in
June, Sir Marcus Fox, vice-chairman of the influential 1922
committee of Conservative back-benchers, said: "I have always
felt that it would be June, and this reinforces my view.
    "I always thought June was right. We have got most of our
legislation through and to go beyond that I do not think would
be in the national interest."
    Another Tory back-bencher, Anthony Beaumont-Dark, said: "I
have always been an October man, but I think it would be good
to get it out of the way now."
    Their comments came as government officials dismissed
speculation about a snap election to coincide with local polls
in May, timed to reap maximum advantage from the recent
popularity surge, Thatcher's successful trip to Moscow and
Labour's current popularity slump.
    Calls for a May poll were also prompted by Tory concern
over a steady advance by the Alliance, and the possibility that
if it continues it could rob the Conservatives of an overall
majority in parliament.
    Today's MORI poll showed an Alliance gain of eight points
over the past month in around 100 key marginal seats where the
outcome of the next election is likely to be decided.

Volcker said a restrictive monetary policy would be damaging to
investment and that a better course would be to restrain
spending.
    "A restrictive monetary policy would hit investment. You
don't want to put interest rates up unless you have to," Volcker
told the Senate Banking Committee.
    "That is not a constructive way to proceed," he said.
    Volcker said that given a choice between squeezing the
budget deficit or squeezing investment, he would favor
squeezing the budget deficit.
    In response to a question about banks, Volcker said he
would be pleased if Congress decided to give banks a tax
writeoff as an incentive for them to take greater reserves
against loans to debtor countries.
    "If you give a tax writeoff for reserving against loans,
then we will see more reserving and that would make me happy,"
Volcker told Committee Chairman Sen William Proxmire (D-Wisc).

The inflow of long-term capital into
West Germany slumped to 606 mln marks in February from
January's record 11.91 billion, with foreign purchases of
German bonds and shares declining sharply, the Bundesbank said.
    While foreigners bought only four billion marks worth of
German bonds in February after 13 billion in January, they sold
a net 500 mln marks in shares and promissory notes of public
authorities after sales worth 300 mln in January.
    With German investors' purchases of foreign securities
steady around 1.3 billion marks, only 2.2 billion marks were
imported through securities transactions, after 11.2 billion.
    Direct investment abroad led to a capital outflow of 1.60
billion marks in February after 2.83 billion in January.
    There was a deficit of 8.14 billion marks in the short-term
capital account after a surplus of 194 mln in January.
    Banks alone exported some 8.6 billion marks in funds while
domestic companies increased their short-term financial assets
abroad by 700 mln. But public authorities received some one
billion marks from abroad, the Bundesbank said in a statement.
    Combining long and short term capital outflows, West
Germany recorded a net outflow of 7.53 billion marks in
February against a net inflow of 11.91 billion in January.
    The Bundesbank confirmed the German trade surplus widened
to 10.45 billion marks in February from January's 7.20 billion.
    Taking the two months together the seasonally adjusted
surplus was slightly below the figure for the previous two. In
terms of current as well as constant prices, the narrowing of
the surplus was progressing, the bank said.
    Germany's current account surplus widened to 6.63 billion
marks in February from 4.79 billion in January, but was down on
the 7.26 billion figure for February 1986. Seasonally adjusted,
the February current account surplus narrowed against January.
    While exports in February fell a half pct against the same
month last year, imports fell 10-1/2 pct largely due to the
drop in prices. Exports grew three pct in volume and imports
two pct.
    In the balance of services, a fall in net investment income
led to a 300 mln mark deficit in February after a 300 mln mark
surplus in January.
    The deficit in transfer payments widened to 3.70 billion
marks from 2.69 billion, largely due to a sharp jump to 2.3
billion marks from 200 mln in payments to the European
Community budget.

the stocks in anticipation of postive announcements by Ford
Motor Co <F> and General Motors Corp <GM> at meetings to be
held at the end of the week, traders said.
    General Motors gained two points to 83-1/2 and Ford one to
91-1/8. Chrysler Corp <C>, which is not expected to make any
major announcements this week, rose 1/4 to 58-1/2.
    "There is a little mystery coming at the end of the week
for the automakers," one trader said, "and in a bull market,
investors don't mind the mystery so much."
    Yesterday, GM's stock climbed 1-3/4 points on expectations
that the company might disclose some bullish news at a meeting
before analysts on April 9-10. A GM spokesman had no comment on
the meeting.
    GM chairman Roger Smith is expected to attend the meeting,
along with GM president James McDonald and other senior GM
executives.
     "The stock could be moving up just on the proximity of the
meeting, thinking GM will say something positive," analyst
Philip Fricke of Goldman Sachs said.
    Though he maintains a buy recommendation on GM, Fricke said
he cut 1987 earnings estimates for the company by 50 cts a
share to 7.30 dlrs a share because of the costs of incentive
programs. The company earned 8.21 dlrs a share in 1986.
     Monday, Ford closed 2-5/8 points higher as rumors
circulated that the company would announce a higher dividend
and a three-for-two stock split at it Thursday board meeting.
     A Ford spokesman said, "it is likely they will have a
dividend announcement." He said it is a board policy to make a
dividend announcement at the first board meeting of the
quarter, but he would not comment on any plans for a change in
the dividend or a stock split.

The use of generic commodity
certificates, or "certs," for fiscal years 1986-88 will save
the government 50 to 100 mln dlrs, Department of Agriculture
Undersecretary Daniel Amstutz said.
    Speaking at a House agriculture subcommittee hearing on the
use of the certificates, Amstutz said that the issuance of 8.5
billion dlrs of certificates during fiscal years 1986-88 could
result in government outlays of up to 400 mln dlrs.
    However, the use of certificates preclude the need for 450
to 500 mln dlrs in storage and handling costs, resulting in net
savings for the government of 50-100 mln dlrs, he said.
    Without the use of certificates, Amstutz said nearly the
entire 1985 crop which had been put under loan would have been
forfeited to the Commodity Credit Corporation, CCC.
    In addition, 260 mln bushels of grain that have been
redeemed from CCC inventory through certificate exchanges would
have remained in the goverment inventory, he said.
    When asked to comment on a recent study by the General
Accounting Office that concluded certificates result in a net
cost to the government, Amstutz said, "GAO underestimated the
benefits and overstated the costs" of the certificate program.
    Amstutz said while certificates encourage more loan
entries, they also encourage heavier loan redemptions rather
than forfeitures.
    GAO underestimated this net loan activity, Amstutz said.
    "There is no question in the mind of the Department of
Agriculture that these certificates have been very useful,"
Amstutz said.
    Immediate benefits of certificates include greater market
liquidity, improved market price competitiveness, higher farm
income, and improved debt situation and decreased carrying
costs, he said.
    Certificates are an integral part of USDA's long-range
market-oriented farm policy, he said.
    Amstutz told subcommittee Chairman Rep. Dan Glickman,
D-Kans., that USDA is in the process of preparing an official
response to the GAO study on certificates and will submit it to
the subcommittee when completed.

(Consolidated-Bathurst Inc) said it
expects improvement in the pulp and paper sector shown in the
second half of 1986 to continue this year. The continued
improvement would be due to good market demand, better product
prices and high operating capacity, the company said in its
annual report.
    Consolidated-Bathurst, which reported operating profit of
104 mln dlrs last year on sales of 2.02 billion dlrs, said its
joint-venture acquisition of a market pulp mill at Castlegar,
B.C. last year broadens its product range and will contribute
to equity earnings.
    Last year's results were up from 1985 operating profit of
80 mln dlrs and sales of 1.73 billion dlrs.
    The company said it views its near-term prospects with
improved optimism.
    It said results from its Bridgewater newsprint mill in the
U.K. should improve greatly this year due to stronger capacity
and production and more favorable market conditions.
    It said it anticipates a return to profitability in 1987
for its Diamond-Bathurst Inc (DBH) subsidiary, which lost 6.2
mln U.S. dlrs and underwent a reorganization last year, and
expects higher sales and earnings for its other North American
packaging divisions.
    Consolidated-Bathurst said the outlook for its Europa
Carton unit is mixed. It said the effect of trade disputes
between the United States and the European Economic Community
on the West German economy and the higher value of the mark may
lead to increased costs which could not be offset by price

More generic grain certificates
should be released onto the market in order for the U.S.
certificate program to have its full effect on commodities,
according to a study by Sparks Commodities Inc.
    The Agriculture Department should make grain deficiency
payments and paid land diversion payments in a two-third
certificate, one-third cash ratio through fiscal year 1989, 
Carroll Brunthaver, president of Sparks Commodities, told a
House agriculture subcommittee hearing on certificates.
    Thereafter, government payments should be issued in roughly
a 50-50 split between cash and certificates, Brunthaver said.
    The Sparks study on certificates examined two possible
scenarios through the 1990 growing season -- a "zero
certificate case," where no certificate program was assumed,
and an alternative case labeled "adequate certificate case" in
which sufficient certificates would be released so that grain
prices would not be artificially supported by market shortages
due to acreage reduction programs or government holdings.
    The study showed that total grain use under the adequate
certificate scenario would exceed the zero certificate scenario
by 11.2 pct.
    Usage would be markedly more in 1989 and 1990, when grain
usage under a certificate program was estimated to exceed the
zero certificate case by 15 to 19 pct.
    For the five-year period examined, government expenditures
under the adequate certificate case were 7.0 billion dlrs, or
7.5 pct less than under the zero certificate case.
    The Sparks study said that 5.1 billion dlrs, or 70 pct of
those savings resulted from smaller government storage costs.
    The study also estimated that government grain stocks under
the adequate certificate case would be 4.7 billion bushels
below the zero certificate case at the end of the period
examined.
    The Sparks study said that while certificates permit market
prices to fall below loan levels, these lower prices increase
commodity usage and reduce the net costs of certificates versus
cash.

Philadelphia Electric Co said the
Operations Engineer at its Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station
has been replaced with another nuclear experienced, qualified
engineer holding a senior operator license at Peach Bottom.
    Early last week, the staff of the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission ordered that unit three of the nuclear power plant
be shutdown after determining that operators were sleeping on
duty.
    In a letter to the commission detailing actions taken as a
result of that order, the utility said the Operations Engineer
had been reassigned to corporate headquarters on April 6.
    Releasing its letter to the NRC, Philadelphia Electric said
it "will have no future comment on this response pending
Nuclear Regulatory Commission disposition" of the case.
    Effective April 11, the utility said, it is establishing
24-hour coverage of operations by at least one independent,
nuclear experienced engineer or physicist per shift posted
within the control room complex who will report directly to the
company's Superintendent of Nuclear Operations Quality
Assurance Division at corporate headquarters.
    Immediately after receipt of the NRC order, Philadelphia
Electric said, Senior Plant Management began making unannounced
control room visits during the night shift, adding this
activity will continue until the planned additional 24-hour
coverage operations are in place.

New immigration rules relating to
alien farm workers and reportedly being drafted by the U.S.
Agriculture Department are meeting with objections in Congress,
sources on Capitol Hill said.
    USDA is drafting regulations, required by a 1986 law, that
would offer amnesty to illegal aliens if they worked in the
cultivation of fruits, vegetables and other perishable
commodities.
    The department is considering including in its definition
of perishable commodities such farm products as tobacco, hops,
Spanish reeds and Christmas trees, while excluding sugar cane,
the New York Times reported yesterday.
    Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif., would like to see the
definition extended to include sugar cane, cultivation of which
is "a breeding ground for one of the scandals of the nation,"
Gene Smith, a spokesman for Berman, said.
    Livestock, dairy and poultry producers have been lobbying
USDA hard to have their products covered by the amnesty
provision, farm industry sources said.
    Chuck Fields of the American Farm Bureau Federation said
livestock producers were "desperate" because they fear they will
be unable to retain the many illegal aliens who have joined
that industry.
    A House staff member involved in drafting the landmark 1986
immigration law who asked not to be identified said Congress
did not mean to extend special amnesty provisions to workers
who helped cultivate tobacco, and that inclusion of hops and
Spanish reeds was "marginal."
    In addition, lawmakers made it clear during consideration
of the bill that lumber workers were not to be covered by the
the amnesty provisions, making the inclusion of Christmas trees
"a tough call," this source said.
    USDA officials declined to comment on the draft regulation
except to say it was subject to change before it will be
released, probably some time later this month.
    While lawmakers may object to the USDA rule under
consideration relating to perishable commodities, Congress is
not likely to reopen debate on the controversial immigration
question, congressional sources said.
    The amnesty provision specially designed for farm workers
was crucial to passage of the overall immigration bill.
    Congressional staff members estimate the special farm
worker amnesty provision would apply to between 250,000 to
350,000 aliens. The law would allow eligible farm workers who
worked for 90 days during the year ending May 1, 1986, to apply
for temporary, then permanent, resident status.

U.S. trade representative Clayton
Yeutter said that if Congress were to require trade
retaliation, it would only close markets and would result in
less trade.
    In remarks prepared for an address to members of the
University of Chicago's Graduate School of Business, Yeutter
said many Congressional proposals do not appear to be overtly
protectionist, yet their undeniable effect would be to close
off market opportunitites, just as exchange rate movement is
unleashing such opportunities for the first time in several
years.
    "Despite all our progress on trade policy and despite the
President's comprehensive competitiveness initiative, there are
many in Congress who still are supporting trade bills
containing many dangerous provisions," Yuetter said.
    Yeutter said many countries would prefer U.S. retaliation
to opening their own markets. "We should be intelligent enough
to not let them off the hook that easily," he said.
    He said that tough but flexible legislative language is
infinitely preferable to tough but inflexible language.
    Both House and Senate trade proposals place undesirable
limits on Presidential discretion, he said.
    "Limiting the President's ability to consider all available
options on issues as sensitive as these would be most unwise,"
Yeutter said. "That could readily provoke retaliation, which
would unneccesarily embroil us in trade wars, injuring most
competitive export industries."
    Yeutter said present U.S. trade laws are fundamentally
sound.
    President Reagan has threatened or implemented retaliation
eight times in the last 18 months -- most recently in the case
of Japanese semiconductors being dumped in world markets.
    "He took these steps as a last resort, only after carefully
analyzing all the contingencies on a case by case basis and
only after determining that such actions would open markets to
American exports", he said.
    Yeutter said it would be foolish to attempt to solve the
U.S. trade deficit by focusing on trade policy alone. He added
that the trade deficit was created primarily by macroeconomic
policy shortcomings here and abroad.

Texaco Inc made a filing in a Texas
Court of Appeals to enjoin the enforcement of the 10.3 billion
dlr judgement pending appeal, an attorney for Pennzoil Co <PZL>
said.
    "They made the filing in the First Court of Appeals in
Texas," said John Jeffers, an attorney at the Houston law firm
of Baker and Botts representing Pennzoil.
    A Spokesman for Texaco had no immediate comment. Attorneys
representing Texaco were not immediately available.
    The filing follows yesterday's decision by the U.S. Supreme
Court, overturning a lower federal court decision that had cut
Texaco's bond to one billion dlrs. The high court ruled that
the issue should first be considered by Texas state courts.
    Texaco yesterday said it would soon file to prevent
enforcement of the bond, but it was unsure whether it would
make the filing in a District Court, the Court of Appeals or
the Texas Supreme Court.
    Jeffers said Texaco chose the Appeals Court because it
currently has jurisdiction in the case.
    According to Texas state law, Texaco could be forced to
post the full amount of the judgement as a bond. If it failed
to do so, Pennzoil could seek liens on Texaco's assets for the
amount of the judgement.
    Texaco's filing contains a request to cut the amount of the
bond to between one and 1.5 billion dlrs, Jeffers said. Asked
what Pennzoil's thought of that amount, he said, "I don't think
it's enough."
    Pennzoil has repeatedly said it would not seek to force
Texaco to post the full amount of the judgement in the form of
a bond, but has said it would seek other forms of security.
    "We've recognized there are other alternatives to a bond,"
Jeffers, the Pennzoil attorney, said.
    Pennzoil will also have the right to respond to the filing
but Jeffers said he was unsure when the response would be made.
    The dispute between Texaco and Pennzoil stems from the 1984
takeover of Getty Oil Co by Texaco. Pennzoil said the merger
violated a prior agreement it had to buy Getty and sued Texaco.
Since then, Pennzoil's position has twice been upheld by Texas
State Courts. The Judgement now stands at 10.3 billion dlrs,
including interest, and is on appeal.

Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc is telling
clients getting nervous about the volatile U.S. stock market to
take a look at European and other foreign stock markets.
    "We're still pushing for a fully invested position (in U.S.
stocks) but we also recognize the market is up 40 pct since
September," says Burton Siegel, investment strategist.
    Rein van der Does, director of international research,
admits to being cautious and somewhat confused about certain
developments in the Tokyo market, such as Nippon Telephone
shares trading at 250 times earnings.
    The firm recently dropped its recommendation on Jaguar plc
<JAGRY> following a sharp runup in the shares. About the same
time, says analyst Khaled Abdel Majeed, Drexel issued a buy
recommendation on the West german automaker BMW.
    He says a new plant and new models brighten the outlook for
1987 and 1988. "The company trades in Germany on the parent
company's earnings but on worldwide consolidated earnings, the
multiple is seven or eight, half that of competitors."
    By contrast Jaguar's share price to earnings multiple is
about 12 and Daimler-Benz AG is around 14 or 15.
    Drexel analyst Lucille Palermo recently upgraded
recommendations on some Canadian gold stocks. With no recession
in sight she sees improved physical demand plus new buying
interest from the Middle East. Also, expectation of a higher
inflation rate stimulates demand.
    On the supply side she thinks "people are overlooking the
problems in South Africa."  Palermo says all of this will push
the bullion price to 475 dlrs an ounce by the end of the year.
    Her current buy recommendations are Agnico-Eagle Mines Ltd
<AEAGF>, American Barrick Resources Corp <ABX>, and Echo Bay
Mines Ltd <ECO>.
    Palermo also believes the overall Canadian stock market has
greater potential this year than last. Although the Canadian
dollar has moved up slightly it is below levels of several
years ago. "Canadian exports of all types look relatively cheap
to foreigners - resources, manufactured goods, bonds and
stocks."
    Other European stocks favored by Drexel include Club
Mediterranee <CMI>, Pernod-Ricard, Royal Dutch Petroleum <RD>,
Unilever <UN>, British Petroleum Co plc <BP> and Imperial
Chemical Industries plc <ICI>. Drexel cautions U.S. investors

Petroleum futures rallied today in a
market that was expecting declines in domestic supplies and
became further unsettled by escalated Mideast fighting.
    Crude oil, gasoline and heating oil all posted gains on the
New York Mercantile Exchange, with crude oil prices matching
life-of-contract highs. Crude for delivery in May closed 17
cents higher at 18.84 dlrs a barrel.
    "Crude futures could jump above 19 dlrs a barrel but will
not remain there long if products are not strong," Robert
Murphy, account executive at E.F. Hutton, said.
    Traders said prices were supported by anticipation that the
American Petroleum Institute would report a decline in domestic
inventories of petroleum products in a weekly report.
    Traders said prices also were supported by an escalation in
the Iran-Iraq war, with the Iranians reportedly launching a new
offensive against Iraqi positions, and Iraq attacking offshore
oil fields and an oil export depot.
    Buying by speculators continued to prompt gains in gold and
silver futures on the Commodity Exchange in New York.
    Gold prices retreated at midday, but rallied before the
close with support from the silver market, which was
approaching two-year highs, traders said.
    Soybean futures posted strong gains on the Chicago Board of
Trade, while corn and wheat were mostly higher.
    Traders said cash sales have been slow in the country, and
the soybean harvest in Brazil has been delayed by rain, which
is limiting supplies.
    In addition, the Agriculture Department last week projected
a substantial drop in soybean acreage this year.     Monday's
report that the USDA inspected 46 mln bushels of corn for
export last week was unexpectedly high and, coupled with a lack
of farm sales, provided support for the corn market, traders
said.
    Live hogs and frozen pork bellies rallied on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, while cattle ended lower.
    Live hogs pushed ahead on a lack of supplies because many
farmers are turning their attention to spring planting rather
than marketing livestock, traders said, noting that cash sales
have been lighter than expected this week.
    The lack of marketing also has supported pork bellies, but
prices drifted lower for moderate losses in nearby months as
speculators sold contracts to take profits, traders said.
    Cattle prices closed lower but continued to show strength
related to tight supplies.
    Prices pushed ahead to new contract highs, extending gains
past three-year peaks set Monday, as tight supplies forced meat
packers to bid aggressively for available animals.
    However, some traders sold contracts to take profits after
the extended rally, which has seen the April delivery contract
soar to 69.90 cents a pound from 56 cents a pound at the start
of the year.
    New York coffee futures closed higher on trade talk Brazil
would not be an aggressive seller near term, analysts said.

The State of Texas, faced with a record
5.8 billion dlr budget deficit over the next two years, may
have to consider introducing income tax,economic analysts said.
     Such a possibility was unthinkable a few years back when
the state's enormous wealth from oil and gas revenues easily
allowed Texans the luxury of paying no personal or corporate
income tax.
     However, last year's dramatic slump in oil prices not only
sent the Texas economy into a tailspin, but cut heavily into
the state's tax revenues.
    Both Moody's Investor Services and Standard and Poor's cut
their credit ratings of the state to double A from the top
triple A in early March.
    Moody's Vice President George W. Leung said it was the
first time Texas' rating had been lowered since 1962, adding
the report noted that while "the Legislature is now considering
proposals to restore budget balance, medium term prospects for
full recovery are weak."
    With only a slight improvement in the economy seen by State
Comptroller Bob Bullock, the Texas Legislature must grapple
with a one billion dlr deficit by August 31 and another 4.8
billion dlr deficit by the end of the next biennium. No other
state in U.S. history has faced such a deficit.
    "There is a strong independent streak in Texans and five
years ago I would never have dreamed the State Legislature
would institute an income tax," said George Bland, Assistant
Professor of Political Science at North Texas State University,
adding, "Now my contacts at the Legislature tell me it's
coming, it's inevitable, it's only a matter of time."
     State taxes on oil and gas production traditionally
supplied as much as a third of the state's revenues.
    However, that source has fallen to about 15 pct in recent
years, and with last year's price slump, the state's dependence
on sales taxes is approaching 50 pct.
     Bland said he believes the Tax Reform Act will be a major
factor in the state's decision because under it sales taxes are
no longer deductible from federal income tax while state income
tax is.
    John Kennedy, senior research associate at the Austin-based
Texas Research League said, "There is a great deal of popular
sentiment against it, plus the first plank of Governor
Clements' platform was no tax increases, let alone a new tax."
    However, he said that since the oil price fall the state
faced a choice of either instituting an income tax or
broadening and possibly raising the sales tax.
    Steve Pejovich, director of the Center for Free Enterprise
at Texas A and M University and an opponent of income taxes,
said he favored reforming the present tax system to take
account of the changed structure of the economy.
    "We should rely less on traditional sources, such as oil
and agriculture and real estate and more on service industries,
manufacturing and high-tech," Pejovich said.
    Tony Proffitt, an aide to State Comptroller Bob Bullock
said, "Bullock is opposed to an income tax, but has warned the
Legislature that if they get tired of looking at everything
else, that's the only option."
    Apart from Texas, states which have no individual income
tax are Alaska, Florida, Nevada, New Hampshire, South Dakota,
Washington and Wyoming 
    For the time being, Attorney General Jim Mattox has ruled
that the Legislature may carry over the current one billion dlr
deficit into the next biennium, even though the state
consitution requires a balanced budget. But as State Treasurer
Ann Richards said last Thursday, "Jim Mattox's decision today
turns the heat down on the pressure cooker, but we must not
think that the goose isn't still cooking."
    Opponents to new or higher taxes argue in favor of spending
cuts. But the state is already under pressure from a Federal
District Court to clean up its overcrowded prison system -- or
face 24 mln dlrs a month in fines.
    And U.S. Education Secretary William Bennett has accused
the state, among others, of lax education reform. Earlier this
year, both houses of the Legislature, citing financial
restraints as well as teacher morale, passed bills abandoning
plans to require teachers to take competency tests.
    Bland said he believes the state will set up a commission
next year to "study alternative revenue sources," with an
income tax being instituted as early as January 1989.
    "If the political leaders are educated about (the effects
of the Tax Reform Act), I think there will be a gradual drift
toward income tax," he said.

Gynex Inc said that Gynex Labs

the distribution agreement under which Searle had exclusive
rights to market Gynex's line of generic oral contraceptives.
    This means that Gynex Labs, 50 pct owned by Gynex and 50
pct by Watson Laboratories, will not get remuneration under the
distribution agreement beyond the 650,000 dlrs received from
Searle in February and March 1986. This has been applied to the
costs of inventories.
    Searle and Gynex Labs will both bear costs involved with a
product recall. Gynex Labs' cost is estimated at 900,000 dlrs,
to be shared equally by Gynex Inc and Watson, it said.
    The companies ended the agreement when it was determined
that Searle's product line sales and marketing commitment would
not allow it to commit the necessary resources for the relaunch
of the Gynex line of oral contraceptives, Gynex said.
    After launching the first two Gynex products in early
February, Searle voluntarily recalled them in March as a
preventive measure because a limited number of packages may
have contained out of order or missing tablets.
    Gynex has made changes that should prevent a recurrence of
the problem, and is ready to reinitiate production, it said.
Talks are underway with other potential distributors.

The Reagan administration is secretly
developing plans for an early deployment of President Reagan's
controversial "Star Wars" anti-missile system, according to a
Senate study.
    "Near-term deployment is an absurd and dangerous course for
America," said Sen. Bennett Johnston in a statement issued with
the report. "It would force us to break the bank, throw out the
ABM treaty and commit us to an arms race in space."
    The Reagan administration is engaged in an internal debate
over the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), as the land and
space-based anti-missile system is called, and may decide later
this month to reinterpret the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile
treaty to justify an acceleration of SDI research to include
development and space testing.
    Johnston, of Louisiana, and fellow Democrat William
Proxmire of Wisconsin, whose staff prepared the report, accused
the administration of covertly seeking early  deployment as a
political ploy to commit the United States to strategic
defenses even after Reagan leaves office in 1989.
    "This report exposes the fact that without a presidential
directive or congressional consent, the SDI program ... is
being changed to pursue a near-term deployment of strategic
defenses," Proxmire, chairman of the powerful Senate
Appropriations Defense Subcommittee, said.
    "In other words, they're covertly reorienting the SDI
program without congressional approval."

Moody's Investors Service Inc said the
credit quality of corporate bond issuers continued to decline
in first quarter of 1987.
    Of all corporate ratings changes during the quarter, 66 pct
were downgrades compared with 55 pct during all of 1986.
    Moody's said downgrades led upgrades last quarter by two to
one. It downgraded 50 companies, affecting 61 billion dlrs of
debt and upgraded 25 companies, affecting 9 billion dlrs of
debt.
    It said more than half of the quarter's downgrades were in
the industrial sector, affecting 25 billion dlrs of debt.
    Moody's said that continued leveraged buyouts and
restructuring among small and medium-sized companies will
account for up to one-quarter of coporate debt downgrades.
    Worldwide competition and overcapacity will continue to
take its toll on industrial companies, Moody's added. It said
intensifying competition in an environment of slow economic
growth, Moody's predicts 2.5 pct worldwide growth in 1987, will
lower returns and margins for many multinational firms.
    Bank and finance company downgrades outpaced upgrades by 16
to 6 respectively. It said this trend will continue because of
Latin American debt problems.

The House Armed Services Committee
slashed President Reagan's funding request for the Strategic
Defense Initiative (SDI), approving 1.7 billion dlrs less than
he had proposed for the anti-missile program.
    The committee, during its consideration of the 1988 defense
authorization bill, also cut by more than half Reagan's request
for a rail system for strategic missiles.
    The proposals must be adopted by the full House and Senate
before becoming law.
    The committee approved 3.5 billion dlrs for SDI, a land-
and space-based anti-missile defense program commonly known as
"Star Wars." The amount was 1.7 billion dlrs less than the
administration request of 5.2 billion dlrs.
    The Reagan administration has requested a total of 312
billion dlrs for defense in 1988, but congressional leaders
have said that will be cut as part of a budget-trimming effort
to reduce the huge federal deficit.
    In other action today, the committee approved 250 mln dlrs
for a rail system for inter-continental ballistic missiles, but
did not specify which missile system. Supporters have said
missiles on such a rail network would be less vulernable to
attack than those in fixed underground silos.
    The administration requested 590 mln dlrs specifically for
a rail-mobile system for the 10-warhead MX missile. But many
congressmen, including House Armed Services Chairman Les Aspin,
a Wisconsin Democrat, favor a smaller mobile missile dubbed the
"Midgetman."

Dutch Finance Minister Onno Ruding
said there was a growing feeling in the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund that commercial banks and debtor
countries should take a greater lead in assembling new
financing packages.
    "The IMF and the Bank may be less inclined to put together
large packages like Mexico," Ruding told reporters in a briefing
on this week's semi-annual IMF and World Bank talks.
    Ruding, who is also chairman of the IMF's policy-making
Interim Committee, said he was reflecting a feeling within the
two institutions.
    Asked whether his comments reflected a feeling the
institutions were being unduly pressured by the Reagan
administration, Ruding replied "we should not go in the
direction of politicisation of the two institutions."
    Ruding said "no country large or small should push in that
direction."  He said he expected commercial bank lending to
debtors to come in for some criticism for the slow pace of
lending recently. Ruding also said he did not expect any major
initiatives to develop a larger commercial bank role in the
debt strategy or any new proposals for dealing with the debt
crisis itself.
    In other remarks, Ruding said many countries supported a
General Capital Increase for the World Bank and he expected
Bank president Barber Conable also to express his support.
    The U.S. has said it is opposed to a GCI at present.
    Ruding said the Interim Committee Communique would support
the use of indicators to assist multilateral surveillance but
would stop short of supporting U.S. proposals for automatic
consultations if indicators were sharply out of line with
policy objectives. Monetary sources say the U.S. has suggested
establishing "norms" or automatic triggers for consultations
among industrial states if policies deviate from plan.
    Currently the plan also has the support of France, the
Netherlands and Italy while Britain, Japan and West Germany are
all opposed.

News of an agreement among G-5 and G-7
finance ministers meeting in Washington this week will be key
to the direction of currency futures at the International
Monetary Market, but any such agreement will need to go beyond
the Paris accord to stem the recent rise in futures, financial
analysts said.
    "If they (the finance ministers) give the market something
really new to look at -- that is, some package that goes beyond
the Paris agreement -- you could have a real boost in the
dollar," said Shearson Lehman Brothers analyst Anne Mills.
    On the other hand, "anything neutral would tend to be
bearish for the dollar," Mills said.
    Traders and analysts agree a simple reaffirmation of the
Paris accord will not be enough to halt the decline in the
dollar, nor will central bank intervention.
    "A lot of people are looking for a reason to buy currencies
and sell the dollar," said one trader for a large retail firm
on the floor of the IMM.
    "If there is no concrete resolution, they will be looking
to sell the dollar, possibly down to the 1.80 mark level," he
said.
    Technically, most currency futures are poised for another
rise, said Smith Barney Harris Upham analyst Craig Sloane.
    Sloane noted that June yen futures set a new contract high
on Tuesday and closed at its best level ever, while June
sterling set a new contract high on Monday.
    "Everything seems to be coming to a head right now and you
don't need much to get things rolling," Sloane said.
    In particular, the June Canadian dollar, for which Sloane
recently put out a buy recommendation, has hovered in a range
between 0.7600 and 0.7660 in recent weeks, forming a triangle
on the charts from which it may soon break out on the upside.
    A close above the contract high of 0.7665 would signal a
breakout, Sloane said, and would likely mean the nearby
Canadian dollar contract would extend its advance to near the
0.7800 level. June Canadian dollar closed at 0.7656 Tuesday.
    Mills noted, however, that interest rate differentials
between Canadian securities and U.S. securities have narrowed
dramatically recently, with yields on 10-year Canadian bonds
only about 80 basis points above U.S. 10-year notes.
    What has helped the Canadian currency, she noted, is an
increasing proportion of foreign funds flowing into the
Canadian equity market, particularly from Japanese investors.
    Other analysts, however, said currency futures may be near
the top of their long-term rally.
    "Something will be done at the (G-5 and G-7) meeting to
calm people," said David Horner of Merrill Lynch Economics.
    The Paris accord has pretty much fixed where major European
currencies will trade, Horner said.
    But sterling futures may still make another run for new
highs, up to 1.6300 to 1.6500 dlr in the June contract, on the
positive atmosphere that will prevail before British elections
and possibly another interest rate cut, Horner said. The June
British pound closed at 1.6080 on Tuesday.
    Horner said that new boundaries for the trading range of
the yen are likely to come out of the G-5 and G-7 meetings.
    The most likely range will be a bottom for the dollar
between 140 to 142 yen per dollar and a top near 150 to 152
yen, Horner said. In yen futures, the bottom of the dollar's
range would be equivalent to 0.007100 to 0.007150 in the June
contract. June yen closed at 0.006913 on Tuesday.
    If such a range does emerge from the meetings, "we will
have one more rally in the yen," Horner said.

Major Japanese automakers are gearing up
to equip sporty models with four-wheel steering, a feature that
could become standard on high-grade cars in the future,
automotive industry sources said.
    Two companies are ready to market such cars soon, they
said. Honda Motor Co Ltd will sell its Prelude with four-wheel
steering from this Friday, and Mazda Motor Corp officials say a
model with the new steering will be out by mid-year. Mazda aims
to ship the cars overseas before year-end but the decision will
depend on initial consumer reaction.
    Nissan Motor Co Ltd has offered a less sophisticated
four-wheel steering system on its Skyline since August 1985.
Toyota Motor Corp has exhibited its developments in the field
at a recent motor show and Mitsubishi Motors Corp said it will
use the system in the near future.
    Though major U.S. And European automakers have also
researched and tested the four-wheel system, they say they are
waiting to see consumer response to the Japanese cars and for
further improvements in safety and costs.
    Four-wheel steering allows drivers to easily manoeuvre into
parking spaces and gives more control on sharp turns. 
    Mazda officials believe the new steering will improve
safety. "At extremes, four-wheel steering gives a driver more
control," said one official. "On slippery surfaces or at high
speeds, the system reduces unnecessary movement of the vehicle."
    While acknowledging the added vehicle stability, a Honda
engineer said: "This invention is not intended to improve
safety, but is aimed at allowing everyone to drive easily."
    Mazda's electronic steering system tells the back wheels to
turn in the opposite direction from the front wheels at slow
speeds but in the same direction at high speeds.
    Honda's system, which is mechanical, is similar but the
direction of the rear wheels is determined by the angle of the
front wheels. With Nissan's system the rear wheels move only
parallel to the front.
    Automakers say professional drivers who have tested the
four-wheel steering say it greatly improves handling.
    An official with one U.S. Vehicle manufacturer said
four-wheel steering is a technical improvement, but it is
uncertain whether it will translate into higher sales or
profits. "All automakers are interested in something new," he
said. "If it becomes a predominant factor, everyone will want to
follow."
    The official said four-wheel steering is partly a gimmick
to sell cars. "It's a benefit of a secondary nature compared
with devices for fuel economy or emission control."
    General Motors Corp has developed a four-wheel steering
system, but is unlikely to market it within the next five
years, Y. Hojoh, engineer with the Japan branch of General
Motors Overseas Corp, said. GM must consider the costs to the
consumer, he added.
    The industry sources said the additional cost of the system
in Japan would probably make little difference to the consumer
as it would be added to already high-priced models.

Talks between
employers and unions in the West German engineering industry
over pay and working hours broke down without result late last
night, an official from the IG-Metall union said.
    IG-Metall, Western Europe's largest union, is reviving its
campaign for a 35-hour working week and is demanding a five pct
pay increase. Strikes for a 35-hour week in 1984 brought West
Germany's automobile industry virtually to a standstill.
    The result of the 1984 campaign was a compromise reduction
in working hours to 38.5 from 40.
    The talks which broke down yesterday were in the key North
Wuerttemberg/North Baden area, which generally sets the trend
for the rest of the country.
    IG-Metall official Ernst Eisenmann, speaking last night,
blamed the failure of the negotiations on the employers. He
said they had been uncompromising on the question of the
shorter week.
    Hans-Peter Stihl, negotiating for the employers, said any
plan to reduce working hours gradually to 35 hours was
unacceptable. 
    The employers have not made an official offer on cutting
the working week, but sources involved in the negotiations say
that they are working on the basis of a possible half-hour
reduction from next year and a pay increase of 2.7 pct in 1987
and of 1.5 pct in 1988.
    The Union will propose that the negotiations be officially
declared a failure and then a process of arbitration is likely.
    IG-Metall has said that cutting the working week will
create jobs in West Germany where more than two mln people are
unemployed. IG-Metall itself has about 2.5 mln members.
    IG-Metall has already been staging a series of "warning
strikes" to press home demands for the 35-hour week.
    Yesterday, 23,000 engineering workers struck at 90 plants
for one to two hours, according to an IG-Metall statement.
    Among the strikers were 4,000 at a Daimler-Benz AG <DAIG.F>
plant in Bremen, and 3,100 at Ford Motor Co's <F> Ford-Werke AG
plant in Saarlouis.

The economic package unveiled yesterday by
the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) marks the start of a
major shift away from the policies of the past, private
economists and government officials said.
    "A big step forward has been taken," said Industrial Bank of
Japan Ltd senior economist Susumu Taketomi.
    The package, seen as a response to mounting overseas
pressure to boost the sagging Japanese economy, calls for a
supplementary budget of more than 5,000 billion yen later this
year, plus increased imports.
    Although the measures must still gain the approval of the
Finance Ministry, economists said the government will find it
too difficult to alter the measures significantly once they
have gained domestic and overseas backing.
    "At last, the LDP and the Ministry of Finance are turning a
corner," said Sumitomo Bank Ltd's chief economist Masahiko
Koido.
    For the past five years the government has adhered to a
tight fiscal policy in its drive to stop issuing deficit
financing bonds in 1990.
    To meet that goal, spending departments are required to
submit annual budgets for current expenditure 10 pct below the
previous year and investment five pct below.
    Masayoshi Ito, chairman of the LDP's policy affairs
council, said yesterday the government must stick to its 1990
fiscal reform target, but should review the ceiling it places
on public works spending.
    Even some Finance Ministry officials privately acknowledge
that policy changes might be needed, including easing the
government's iron grip on spending.
    Economists said the government could meet its 1990 target
and also increase spending by using money it got from the sale
of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp shares and by taking
advantage of lower than expected interest rates on its debt.
Officially, the Finance Ministry is adhering to its tight
stance but some signs of change have appeared.
    "We do not have any intention of abandoning our objective to
restore fiscal balance," a Finance Ministry spokesman said.
    He said so far the ministry had tried to achieve two goals
simultaneously. These were reforming the government's fiscal
position and stimulating domestic demand.
    But the Finance Ministry spokesman added, "In looking at the
current situation of the economy and the relationship between
Japan and the United States, we feel we have to place more
emphasis on stimulating demand."
    Economists predict battles within the government over the
coming months as the Finance Ministry fights to ensure the
cracks in its policy do not lead to a complete breakdown of
fiscal discipline.
    "The Ministry is afraid that once there is a small hole in
the dike, it will lead to a flood," Industrial Bank's Taketomi
said.
    But Taketomi said the ministry, provided it has a device in
place to check excess spending for political reasons, is likely
to give the go-ahead to a shift in policy.
    "This seems to mark the first step toward a more active
fiscal policy in response to requests from the international
community," he said.
    Sumitomo's Koido said if the government quickly implements
the LDP's 5,000 billion yen package, economic growth in the
1987/88 year ending next March 31 could be around three pct,
His current forecast of 2.2 pct growth assumes a supplementary
budget of around 1,000 billion yen.

The five-nation <International Aero
Engine> (IAE) consortium has decided not to go ahead with the
proposed launch of its Superfan engine, a spokesman for
consortium member <Rolls-Royce Plc> said.
    He said a group board meeting had concluded that a launch
would have been premature given the risks involved in trying to
meet an availability date of Spring, 1992 required by airlines.
    However, he added that the project had not been cancelled
and could be offered later on.
    The engine was originally proposed for fitting on the
<Airbus Industrie> A340.
    IAE's members are Rolls, United Technologies Corp's <UTX.N>
Pratt and Whitney, Fiat SpA <FIAT.MI> <Japanese Aero Engines
Corp> and <MTU> of West Germany.
    Airbus said this week it would switch to the Franco-U.S.
CFM-56-S3 alternative because of doubts whether the Superfan
would be ready on time.
    Rolls, which has been state-owned since 1971, launches its
"pathfinder" prospectus giving preliminary details of its public
flotation later today.
    Analysts said that the timing of the postponement of
Superfan -- an 30,000 pound thrust upgrade of the consortium's
V2500 engine fitted to the A320 -- was embarrassing but should
not be considered a serious blow. If anything, it indicated the
financial prudence of the group, one added.
    The Rolls spokesman added that the decision did not affect
the V2500 programme itself. Equally, there was the possibility
that the consortium would go ahead with the Superfan later on.
    Rolls RB211 engine was not available for fitting to early
versions of the Boeing Co <BA.N> 747 but had since captured
about 25 pct of the market, he noted.

Elders IXL Ltd <ELXA.S> plans to float
off the around 5,000 public houses belonging to its U.K.
Subsidiary Courage Ltd to raise about one billion stg, Elders
strategy executive director Stuart Kelso said.
    The scheme, subject of speculation in a Scottish newspaper
yesterday, was fairly well advanced, but not certain to go
ahead. "There could be road blocks," he added.
    The earliest flotation date would be June, though the sale
will probably be later. Elders would retain a one-third
interest in the property interests under the current plan.
    No immediate use has been earmarked for the funds raised.
    Kelso said float plans currently include an offering of
debentures to institutional investors and issues of ordinary
shares and convertible stock for sale to the public.
    Elders bought Courage from Hanson Trust Plc <HNSN.L> last
year for 1.4 mln stg. The deal followed Elders' unsuccessful
efforts to expand into the U.K. Drinks industry by acquiring
Allied-Lyons Plc <ALLD.L>.
    Hanson acquired Courage when it took over Imperial Group
Plc early last year. The Elders plan to raise funds from
Courage is a variant of the its earlier scheme to sell off 50
pct stakes in the Allied-Lyons pubs to their publicans, market
sources added.

Nickel prices are unlikely to rise
significantly from current levels unless further steps are
taken to reduce production, Shearson Lehman Brothers said in
its quarterly nickel market report.
    The market had recovered slightly to around 1.72 dlrs a lb
yesterday from its four year low of 1.55 dlrs in early January,
due to the absence of Soviet nickel cathode deliveries, but
Shearson sees Soviet shipments soon returning to last year's
buoyant levels, which should ease current tightness.
    Output reductions by producers will take effect later this
year but are likely to be offset by increases elsewhere.
    Shearson said the nickel market will be virtually in
balance during 1987, with total non-Socialist world demand at
556,000 tonnes, compared with an estimated 544,000 tonnes in
1986, production at 505,000 tonnes (504,000) and imports from
Socialist countries at 47,000 tonnes (50,000).
    It forecast prices will edge higher during the year from a
first quarter average of 1.67 dlrs a lb up to 1.77 dlrs in the
last quarter. The year's average will be around 1.72 dlrs a lb
compared with 1.76 dlrs in 1986, using London Metal Exchange
cash metal prices in dollar terms and assuming an average 1987

Japan should promote division of labour
with its Asian neighbours, especially the newly industrialized
countries, to help achieve more balanced world economic growth,
the Bank of Japan said in a report.
    Instead of trying to produce everything by itself, Japan
should open up its market further to imports, transfer
manufacturing facilities abroad and increase technology
transfer with those nations, the bank said in its monthly
report.
    Japan should not see industrializing Asian nations as mere
competitors in its overseas and domestic markets but as
countries that can contribute to the region's prosperity.
    The bank said trade relations between Japan and the Asian
neighbouring countries have so far been vertical, meaning that
Japan imports primary goods from those countries and exports
manufactured goods to them.
    But this has resulted in an increase in their trade
deficits with Japan while some newly industrialized Asian
nations have accumulated trade surpluses with countries like
the United States.

Banking supervisory authorities are
not carrying out any special checks at banks in the wake of the
currency fraud scandal at Volkswagen AG <VOWG.F>, a spokesman
for the Hesse regional state central bank, LZB, said.
    But inspectors are paying particular attention to foreign
exchange matters in their routine checks at banks, he said in
answer to enquiries. There is no evidence rules were broken.
    The LZB spokesman was commenting on press reports that
banks had "parked" open currency positions for short periods with
VW to circumvent regulations limiting the size of open currency
positions that can be carried by banks overnight.
    The press allegations emerged after VW said it may have
lost 480 mln marks as a result of a possible currency fraud.
    LZBs are regional branches of the Bundesbank. Their
inspectors also act for the Federal Banking Supervisory Office
in West Berlin, which regulates banking in West Germany.
    Following the 1974 Herstatt bank crash on currency
speculation, West Germany limited a bank's total open positions
overnight to 30 pct of shareholders' equity and reserves.
    German press reports have said some banks circumvented this
rule by selling excess positions to VW, then repurchasing them.
    The banking regulations only cover banks. Company foreign
exchange activities are not subject to the banking regulators.
    The LZB spokesman said there were no concrete signs that
the regulations had been broken, and it would be irresponsible
to instigate a special check just on the basis of the reports.
    The LZBs receive monthly balance sheet statistics from
banks in their areas, which they check, and they also routinely
inspect all banks in greater detail over longer periods.
    But LZB officials said it would be hard for inspectors to
detect a breach of these rules as they do not check companies
and therefore would not see both sides of any parking deal.
    "If the managements of the banks have not spotted them, it
will be even harder for our inspectors," said one official.
    It would be up to the public prosecutors to order special
checks on suspicion of breaches of these regulations, they
said. Prosecutors in Brunswick are already investigating the VW
currency scandal, and have ordered the arrest of VW's former
chief foreign exchange dealer.
    Breaches of the Banking Law in this way can be punished by
a 100,000 mark fine for the dealers involved, and in extreme
cases by removal of the managers if their active involvement is
proved.

Senate Banking Committee Chairman
William Proxmire (D-Wis) said he planned to introduce
legislation shortly to require greater public disclosure of
corporate takeovers and fairer treatment for all shareholders.
    Speaking to the National Association of Manufacturers,
Proxmire said recent insider trading stock scandals increased
the chance that Congress will act to curb abuses.
    "We are proposing legislation that would provide for more
disclosure, would be fairer to all shareholders, and would
insure that takeovers are properly financed," he said.
    Among the provisions, the bill would reduce the threshold
for notifying the Securities and Exchange Commission that a
investor or group has acquired a percentage of stock in a
company to three pct from the current five pct threshold within
10 days, Proxmire said.
    In addition, there would be a pre-notificaton requirement
that an investor intended to aquire three pct that would have
to filed with the SEC.
    Proxmire said the pre-notification requirement was meant to
prevent arbitragers from having a jump on the general public in
knowing about coming takeover attempts.
    Proxmire said he would call for extending the period that a
tender offer must be kept open under the Williams Act to 60
business days from the current 20 business days.
    His bill would provide for private suits if the acquiring
company violated the time period on the tender offer.
    To correct abuses in the financing of takeovers, Proxmire
said the legislation would aim at insuring current margin
requirments are properly enforced.
    The Federal Reserve Board has a 50 pct margin requirement
for purchasing stock, but Proxmire said it is not generally
enforced in hostile takeovers.
    Rather, the groups or individuals leading a takeover
declare that they can raise the capital for a takeover without
actually putting any of their own money, Proxmire said.
    He said his bill would allow private suits for damages for
failure to meet the Federal Reserve's 50 pct margin
requirements.
    The bill also would require more disclose when several
investors form an alliance in a hostile takeover.
    "When Pickens and Icahn get together we want people to know
about it," Proxmire said.
    Proxmire said he favored the approach used in Britain
towards two-tiered tender offers that insures that all
shareholders recieve equal treatment.
    He said he expected amendments to the bill also would cover
defensive mechanisms such as green mail and poison pills.
    Proxmire said he intended to introduce his bill later this
month and predicted the Senate committee would act this spring.
    He said he was hopeful Congress could pass a bill this
year.

augurs well for its earnings in 1987.
    "The generally strong outlook bodes well for significantly
improved earnings this year," Burnell Roberts, chairman and
chief executive officer said.
    Earlier, the company reported first quarter earnings of
34.2 mln dlrs, or 1.09 dlrs a share, versus 20.3 mln dlrs, or
65 cts a share, in last year's first quarter.
    In 1986 the company reported earnings from continuing
operations of 109.3 mln dlrs, or 3.50 dlrs a share.
    Mead said its first quarter benefitted from stronger market
conditions and improved operations.
    "The combination of capital improvement programs and more
employee involvement has been paying off throughout our paper
operations," Roberts said.
    He added that Mead's pulp and paperboard businesses are
operating well as prices have improved and strong demand has
placed most products in a sold-out position through the middle

    Mead said sales of its unbleached coated paperboard was

Demand for shares in state-owned engine
maker <Rolls Royce Plc> is expected to be substantial when the
government privatises it at the end of April, Christopher Clark
of the group's bankers Samuel Montagu and Sons Ltd said.
    He told a press conference after the release of an initial
prospectus for the float that the issue would be offered to
U.K. Institutions, company employees and the general public.
    As in previous flotations, clawback arrangements would be
made if public subscriptions exceeded initial allocations.
    He declined to say how the shares would be allocated beyond
saying that a "significant proportion" would go to institutions.
    A decision on what percentage would go to each sector would
be made shortly before the sale price was announced on April
28.
    Minimum subscription would be for 400 shares with payment
in two tranches, again a method broadly in line with previous
privatisations.
    Chairman Sir Francis Tombs denied suggestions that Rolls
was a stock that should be left to the institutions. He noted
that although the aircraft industry was cyclical, Rolls had
several operations -- such as spare parts and military
equipment -- that evened out the swings.
    Rolls' 1986 research and development expenditure in 1986
was 255 mln stg and could be expected in the future to vary
according to changes in turnover.
    He noted that net research and development expenditure was
written off in the year it occurred, a policy that received
"inadequate recognition in one or two of the more extravagant
forecasts of future profits." He made no forecast himself.
    In 1986, Rolls reported that pretax profit rose 48 pct to
120 mln stg on turnover 12 pct higher at 1.8 billion.

Volkswagen AG <VOWG.F>,
VW, is due to make a formal announcement about its 1986
dividend tomorrow after saying the 1985 level of 10 marks per

a suspected foreign currency fraud.
    A spokesman said VW's supervisory board will meet tomorrow
to discuss the payout.  A statement will be made afterwards.
    VW has also said disclosed profits for 1986 will reach
their 1985 level, despite provisions of a possible 480 mln
marks linked to the currency affair. The figure is virtually
the same as the 477 mln mark 1985 parent company net profit.
    When VW first confirmed the currency scandal on March 10 it
said the management board would propose an unchanged 10-mark
dividend to the supervisory board. A dividend of 11 marks would
be proposed for the company's new preference shares.
    Share analysts said they saw supervisory board approval of
the management board proposal as virtually a formality.
"Anything else would be more than a surprise," one said.

maintain the disclosed profit. Parent company reserves stood at

Promising new findings in the use of
a controversial experimental drug called Interleukin-2 as a
cure for cancer will be published in the April 9 issue of the
prestigious New England Journal of Medicine, according to a
Wall Street analyst who has obtained an advance copy of the
magazine.
    Among interleukin's principal U. S. makers are Cetus Corp
<CTUS>, headquartered in Emeryville, Calif., and Immunex Corp
<IMNX>, based in Seattle, Wash.
    The journal, to be released late today, contains two
articles reporting high remission rates several cancer types.
    The journal also contains a signed editorial concluding
that the new results mark a significant milestone in the search
for a successful immunotherapy for cancer.
    Interleukin-2, also known as IL-2, is a substance naturally
produced by living cells in the laboratory.
    The drug is controversial because it was widely praised as
a promising cancer treatment in early reports on its
effectiveness in late 1985, only to come under criticism a year
later for its failure to live up to its promise and due to its
ravaging side effects.
    One of the new studies, conducted by Dr. William West of
Biotherapeutics Inc of Franklin, Tenn., is particularly
significant because it found far fewer harsh side effects after
it changed the way in which the drug is administered.
    In that study, researchers administered IL-2 to 48 cancer
patients and found a 50-pct remission rate for kidney cancers
and a 50 pct remission rate for melanoma, a type of skin
cancer, according to Prudential-Bache Securities' Stuart
Weisbrod, who obtained the advance copy of the magazine.
    For rectal and colon cancer, the researchers found no
remissions, but none of the 48 patients treated had side
effects serious enough to be placed under intensive hospital
care, according to the article.
    In the second study, whose principal author is Dr. Steven
Rosenberg of the National Cancer Institute, researchers
administered IL-2 to 157 cancer patients and found a 33 pct
remission rate in cancers of the kidney, a 27 pct rate in
melanomas and a 15 pct rate in cancers of the colon and rectum.
    In the National Cancer Institute trials, a total of four
patients died, the magazine reported, confirming the harshness
of the drug's side effects as originally administered.
    "Perhaps we are at the end of the beginning of the search
for successful immunotherapy for cancer," said the editorial,
signed by John Durant of Philadelphia's Chase Cancer Center.
    "These observations reported by Rosenberg and West surely
did not describe successful practical approaches ready for
widespread applications in the therapy of cancer patients," the
editorial said.
    "On the other hand, if they reflect, as seems possible, a
successful manipulation of the cellular immune system, then we
may be near the end of our search for a meaningful direction in
the immunuotherapy of cancer," the editorial concluded.

An audit submitted to the Georgia
Public Service Commission claims that between 944 mln dlrs and
1.8 billion dlrs of the costs of the Plant Vogtle nuclear power
station should be disallowed, a Southern Co spokeswoman said.
    Southern's Georgia Power Co subsidiary has a 45.7 pct
interest in the plant and estimated earlier this year it would
cost a total of 8.87 billion dlrs. Last year, the plant's
owners pledged to Georgia regulators they would limit the cost
passed on to rate payers to 8.4 billion dlrs.
    The Southern spokeswoman said the company feels the report
by O'Brien-Kreitzberg is "flawed and biased." She said the
report was released yesterday by the state attorney general.
    Responding to the report today, Georgia Power Chairman
Robert W. Scherer told a news conference the conclusions drawn
by the firm "are not only wrong -- they also reflect the same
bias against nuclear power that these auditors have
demonstrated in similar cases accross the country."
    Saying he was not suggesting Georgia power was without
fault, Scherer said "the audit identified several things I wish
we had done differently."
    Scherer pointed out a report O'Brien-Kreitzberg submitted
to Georgia regulators in March 1986 projected Georgia Power
would not finish Plant Vogtle unit one before the end of 1987.
    Noting "unit one is finished, and we expect it to be in
commercial operationg by June," he said the firm's latest
report ignored the earlier projection, gave the utility no
credit for the completion and "actually penalized us by
suggesting that costs to maintain t he schedule be disallowed."
    Scherer said the latest audit alleges Georgia Power could
have saved 95 mln dlrs if it had stopped using four shifts,
seven days a week to speed construction three years sooner.
    He said this would have delayed completion of the plant for
another year "and it would have cost several hunderd million
dlrs more."
    Noting the audit said costs were increased 600 mln dlrs by
schedule delays totaling 20.5 months, he said "First, we have
the best concrete placement record in the industry, Second new
government regulations after the Three Mile Island incident
significantly increased construction time.

Cheap oil feedstocks, the weakened U.S.
dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will
propel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to record
profits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990,
major company executives predicted.
    This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an
industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF
Corp <GAF>, privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firms
to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants.
    Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc <ASH>, the
Kentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping for
money-making petrochemical businesses to buy.
    "I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period," said
Paul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co <DOW>, adding,
"There's no major plant capacity being added around the world
now. The whole game is bringing out new products and improving
the old ones."
    Analysts say the chemical industry's biggest customers,
automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of
paints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year.
    U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about
90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike
product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher,
managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand
for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up
by as much as 300 pct, he said.
    Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in
Houston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned
last year and predicted it would have the best year in its
history.
    In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel
and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S.
dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. "I believe the entire
chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it,"
Oreffice said.
    GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical
industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987.
Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion
dlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985.
    The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical
industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and
planning, said Pace's John Dosher.
    Dosher said last year's fall in oil prices made feedstocks
dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar
was weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost
U.S. chemical exports.
    Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has
been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical
manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers
in the early 1980s.
    Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers
have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program
to mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate
unrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of
friendly and hostile takeover attempts.
    GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire
Union Carbide Corp <UK>, recently offered three billion dlrs
for Borg Warner Corp <BOR>, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics
and chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace <GRA> 
has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer
businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions.
    But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be
headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on
the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as
ethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that
are custom-designed for a small group of buyers.
    "Companies like DuPont <DD> and Monsanto Co <MTC> spent the
past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity
chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had
deteriorated," Dosher said. "But I think they will eventually
kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche
market." Some top chemical executives share the concern.
    "The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting
carried away and repeating past mistakes," GAF's Heyman
cautioned. "The shift from commodity chemicals may be
ill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long."
    Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the
Sterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700
mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend.
    Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout
of Dupont's Conoco Inc's chemical business, has spent 1.1
billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants
along the Texas Gulf Coast.
    The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that
are the building blocks of specialty products.
    "This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a
glamorous, high-margin business," Cain said, adding that demand
is expected to grow by about three pct annually.
    Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said
chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for
plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood
and steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical
business could last as long as four or five years, provided the
U.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.

Faulty repair work by The Boeing Company

the final draft of a Ministry of Transport report says.
    There were only four survivors when the aircraft crashed
into a mountain north of Tokyo.
    The report said inadequate inspection of the aircraft by
Japanese inspectors after the repairs was another factor in the
crash. The crew were cleared of any responsibility for the
disaster.
    The report, which was sent on March 23 to the U.S. National
Transportation Safety Board for comment, should be released in
late May. Under an international convention the draft must be
submitted for final comments to the relevant authorities.

would probably make no comment on the Japanese investigation
team's report until it was officially released.
    On September 6, 1985, Boeing said in a statement that the

First Boston Corp analyst William
Randol recommended the purchase of Texaco Inc today, saying
"the discount that investors have made in the share price to
reflect the ongoing litigation with Pennzoil has been overdone
relative to how we expect the case to conclude."
    Texaco's stock rose 1/8 to 34-1/8.
    On Monday, the stock tumbled four points after the Supreme
Court overturned a lower court decision that cut Texaco's bond
in the 10.3 billion dlr legal dispute with Pennzoil Co <PZL> to
one billion dlrs. Yesterday, a Texas court granted a temporary
injunction on the bond issue pending a hearing next week.
    The current litigation arose from Texaco's buyout of Getty
Oil Co in 1984. Pennzoil sued, arguing its earlier agreement to
buy Getty was binding. Two Texas state courts upheld Pennzoil's
position.
     Randol, noting that the stock has suffered a great deal in
the two years since the litigation was filed, said "we
recognize the legal problems but think investors have overdone
it."
    He said "the stock is selling at 48 pct of its asset value,
and we think it represents a good value at this level."

John Shad said he wanted Congress to write a better definition
of insider trading but thought action should wait until the
Supreme Court ruled on an insider trading case.
    "I'd like the benefit of the Winans decision before
deciding on a definition," Shad told a Senate Appropriations
subcommittee hearing.
    Shad was refering to the appeal by former Wall Street
Journal reporter R. Foster Winans of his conviction on insider
trading charges for telling a friend in advance what stocks he
was going to write about in his column.
    The stocks usually went up or down in price depending on
Winans' recommendation.
    He said insider trading accounted for only 11 percent of
the SEC's enforcement activities last year despite the
publicity given to recent major cases.
    "Insider trading makes up only a tiny fraction of one pct
of the 50 billion dlrs of daily securities trading," Shad said.
    Shad asked for a budget increase so the SEC could enlarge 
its enforcement staff by 20 this year and 73 next year to deal
with all types of securities fraud.
    Shad said he hoped to start his new duties as U.S.
Ambassador to the Netherlands by June. He said he did not know

Director James Miller said President Reagan will reject the tax

    "It's just completely unacceptable," Miller told a House
Appropriations subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service and

    The plan, drafted by the Democratic-controlled Budget
committee, calls for 22 billion dlrs in higher revenues, of
which 18 billion would be from new taxes set by the tax-writing
committees.
    The House committee's budget proposal includes some
increases in federal user fees as well as 18 billion dlrs in
taxes.
    Miller warned that failure to reduce the federal deficit
would jeopardize the U.S. economy.
    "If we do not further reduce the deficit... we place this
economic expansion that we've had in the last five years at
risk," Miller told the subcommittee.
    "The result of any kind of tax increase would be to increase
substantially the prospects that the expansion would come to an
end," Miller said.

said it has added a new chief compliance officer and will
expand its regulatory surveillance program.
    Paul O'Kelly, currently assistant regional administrator of
the Securities and Exchange Commission, was named
vice-president of compliance for the exchange, the CME said.
    The expanded compliance program, which calls for an
increase in the exchange's compliance budget and addition of
staff, was in response to recent criticisms that the CME's
current surveillance was not able to keep up with increased
demands of recent volatility and volume, the CME said.
    The new surveillance program calls for the addition of
three floor investigators and five compliance investigators,
the CME said.
    Some of the new staff will monitor the exchange's new
Computerized Trade Reconstruction system, scheduled to start
July 1.
    In addition, three computer programmers will be added to
assist in regulatory support for the exchange's management
information system department.
    Recent criticism has been especially directed at the CME's
Standard and Poor's stock index futures and options division.
    A special membership referendum to prohibit CME members
from filling customer orders and trading for their own account
in S and P 500 futures and options will be voted on April 13.
    In a letter dated March 12, CME chairman John Sandner and
Executive committee chairman Leo Melamed urged members to
reject the referendum in favor a series of new rules.
    Included in the rule changes was the requirement that
futures brokers in the S and P pit manually record all personal
trades to the nearest minute, intended to "enhance the
effectiveness of surveillance and compliance functions,"
    "We made a promise to our members that we have kept,"
Melamed said in a release today.
    He said the new surveillance program "represents a
commitment to a vigorous enforcement policy."

The largest U.S. textile maker focused
on its own business as its competitors found merger partners,
but now Burlington Industries Inc may have restructured itself
into an attractive takeover candidate, analysts said.
    The takeover spotlight fell today on Burlington, which rose
4-7/8 to 52-7/8 on speculation that investor Asher Edelman and
Dominion Textiles Inc of Canada bought an almost five pct
stake.
    A published report said Edelman and Dominion jointly
acquired a stake in Burlington and were weighing a takeover
offer. Edelman would not comment, and a spokesman for
Montreal-based Dominion called the report just "rumors."
    Burlington said it did not know if the report was true.
    Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced of
the story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors if
Burlington actually came into play.
    Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion, however,
added credence to the speculation. Dominion has said that it
was looking for a takeover in the U.S.
    Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Mills
and has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used for
a U.S. acquisition.
    A Dominion spokesman said Canada's largest textile producer
has been negotiating with "many" U.S. textile companies, but
would not say whether Burlington was among them.
    "There have been acquisitions in this area. It's not
unusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after the
housecleaning they've done," said Eileen Gormley of Thomson
McKinnon.
    Burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheets
and other linens, to J.P. Stevens and Co Inc for 110 mln dlrs
last year. It also has reorganized management, and focused its
operations on businesses that would be less affected by foreign
competition, Gormley said.
    "They've pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer,"
said Gormley. She said in moving more heavily into industrial
fabrics, Burlington bought C.H. Masland, which supplies carpets
and other fabric to the auto industry.
    "In the past, they just spent and never realized the return
on the outlays they did make," she said.
    "You look at their record over the year, and I think
they're poised to be more profitable than they had been in the
past," Gormley said.
     She estimated 1987 earnings of 2.50 dlrs per share, up
from 2.01 dlrs per share.
    Some analysts today recommended clients not buy Burlington
at its current levels.
    Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook said he recommends
selling. He said he believes the stock is worth only about 50
dlrs on a takeover basis and about 46 dlrs on an earnings
basis.
    Some arbitragers, however, said takeover values have been
placed on the company of 60 to 65 dlrs per share.
    "After Asher's (Edelman) recent history, a lot of people
don't find him very credible anymore," said one arbitrager.
    Another, however, said Edelman succeeds in forcing
managements to take steps to enhance shareholder values even if
he doesn't win the target company.
    Edelman was unsuccessful last year in offers for Lucky
Stores Inc and Fruehauf Corp. He did succeed in buying
Ponderosa Inc.
    The stocks of other textile makers rose along with
Burlington.
    J.P. Stevens <STN> climbed 5/8 to 44-7/8, and Fieldcrest
Cannon Inc <FLD>, the result of a merger of Fieldcrest and
Cannon, rose 1-1/8 to 39-3/4. West Point-Pepperell Inc <WPM>

A Treasury official said there are no
plans to try to reduce the U.S. budget deficit by issuing
yen-denominated bonds that would become known as "Reagan bonds."
    "It simply isn't something that we are planning to do," the
official said.
    He added the Treasury was aware of Japanese news reports
suggesting the Reagan administration might issue such bonds as
the former Carter administration did when it sold "Carter bonds"
denominated in West German marks.
    But he said the situation was greatly different now.
    "If you look at the differences between the treasury market
now and in the Carter administration years, it is a much more
global market now," the official said.
    "There was not the same ease then for the holder of another
currency to buy other countries' securities," he added, "But
there is no difficulty now for them to purchase dollars and buy
U.S. securities."
    The United States needs dollars, not Japanese yen, to pay
its debts and reduce the deficit and so has no plans to issue
yen-denominated bonds, he emphasized.

Advanced Micro Devices Inc said it is
developing a set of five computer chips for use in digital
communications systems.
    The company said the new chips support the integrated
services digital network, or ISDN, the international standard
for digital voice and data communications.
    Advanced Micro also said it has signed a licensing
agreement with American Telephone and Telegraph Co <T> under
which ATT has provided it with certain digital communications
specifications.
    Today's announcement follows the company's introduction
last week of a 32-bit microprocessor.
    "We have now reached a key point in the development of
communications devices that implement a worldwide ISDN
standard," said John East, group vice president for Advanced
Micro's logic businesses.
    He said the company's new computer chips, to be available
by the end of this year, should boost the acceptance and
implementation of ISDN services.
     The chip set includes five separate devices in 100 unit
quantities. The devices are priced from 7.25 dlrs to 29.25
dlrs. Similar chip sets for ISDN communications are already
being sold by a number of companies including INTEL Corp
<INTC>, ATT, Rockwell International <ROK> and a joint venture
between Northern Telecom LTd <NT> and Motorola Inc <MOT>.
    The ISDN standard, portions of which are still being
defined, will provide for the simultaneous transmission of
voice, data and video.
    Advanced Micro chip sets will be used in equipment such as
private branch exchanges and desktop computers.
    The company also said it is developing an ISDN protocol
controller. It said the controller will connect directly with
its current line of ISDN devices.
    The device supports several digital communications
protocols, including ones from International Business Machines
Corp <IBM> and ATT.

Quebec mines minister Raymond Savoie said
the province is prepared to offer money to help re-open
(Noranda Inc)'s Murdochville, Quebec copper mine, shut down by
fire last week, but said he could not give a specific figure
until damage estimates have been completed.
    Federal member of parliament for the region, Charles-Eugene
Marin, said last week the federal government is also prepared
to provide financial help to restart operations as soon as
possible. Noranda has estimated damage from the fire at about
10 mln dlrs and a company spokesman said it should have a more
specific estimate by the end of the month.
    Noranda said it had hoped to have an estimate sooner, but
has found that it will take longer than expected to gain access
to the burned-out area.
    Noranda said the mine was not insured.
    "We decided many years ago...that the costs of insuring all
of Noranda's underground operations would have been
prohibitive," Larry Taylor, Noranda's risk management and
insurance director, said.
    Taylor said before last week's fire, the company had only
had one previous mine accident many years ago.
    Last week's fire killed one miner and trapped 52 other
underground, some for up to 24 hours. It was believed to have
started on a new conveyor system.
    Noranda has said it would take four to five months to
return the mine to normal operating capacity. It produced
72,0000 tons of copper anode last year, Coffin said.

Philadelphia Electric Co will have
to spend an average of about five mln dlrs a day to replace the
electricity which would have been generated by the Peach Bottom
nuclear power plant, Chairman J. Lee Everett said.
    The Nuclear Regulatory Commission ordered the utility to
close the plant early last week.
    "This is the first time an operating plant has been shut
down by the NRC specifically because of plant operator
problems," Everett told the company's annual meeting.
    He did not say who would pay for the replacement power --
rate payers or shareholders.
    Everett told the meeting Philadelphia Electric can not give
a definitive answer on the cost of the shutdown until it gets
Peach Bottom back in service.
    He said the utility had been aware for some time it had
attitude problems among the operating forces at Peach Bottom
and thought it had been making progress toward improvement.
    "While the attitude of operating personnel at Peach Bottom
has been rated poor, the attitudes or our personnel at
Limerick, our other nuclear plant, have been rated excellent.
We have asked ourselves over and over how two plants, managed
by the same company, can be so different."
    Everett said "Limerick has been the model for improvements
we set out to accomplish at Peach Bottom, and remains so."
    He said a special committee composed of Philadelphia
Electric's outside directors will monitor and direct the
company's investigation of the problem.

The relatively high level of real U.S.
interest rates suggests that there is scope for further
declines in money market rates, but the Federal Reserve is
unlikely to promote such a drop as long as the dollar remains
volatile, said J.P. Morgan and Co Inc chairman Lewis Preston.
    He said in response to a reporter's question after the
bank's annual meeting that money market rates could decline
further but, "I don't think the Fed is going to encourage that
as long as the exchange markets are as volatile as they are."
    On the other hand, he said that, barring a collapse of the
dollar, he did not see rates going much higher.
    He said that Morgan's recent rise in its prime lending rate
was "purely a reflection of an increase in a whole spectrum of
rates."
    Preston reiterated earlier company forecasts that the U.S.
economy should show roughly 2.5 to three pct real growth this
year.
    He also said that as a consequence of the dollar's decline
and oil price rises, inflation would rise "moderately" to a 3.5
to four pct rate in 1987.

Medtronic Inc said it sees 15 pct
growth in sales and earnings for the year ending April 30,
1988.
    At an analysts meeting here the company said that for the
year ending April 30, 1987 it will earn about 73 mln dlrs, or
about 5.15-5.35 dlrs a share on sales of about 500 mln dlrs.
    In the year ago period, the company earned 53.4 mln dlrs,
or 3.65 dlrs a share, on sales of 402.8 mln dlrs.
    Winston Wallin, Medtronic chairman, said the company will
improve market share in fiscal 1988 in cardiac pacemakers and
expand its cardiovascular therapeutic product line.
    Wallin cautioned analysts not to quickly change their per
share estimates for the company as he said Medtronic will have
heavy sales and marketing expenses in fiscal 1988.
    He said the company intends to reinvest its earnings in its
businesses and not in its dividends. "Shareholders are better
off if we grow the business rather than reinvest in dividends
or share repurchases," he said.
    Wallin said he sees Medtronic's share of the total
worldwide pacemaker market increasing to 42 pct in fiscal 1988,
from 40 pct in fiscal 1987.
    He said the worldwide market for cardiovascualr therapeutic
products, which includes pacemakers, valves, catheters and
lasers, will be valued at about 2.5 billion dlrs 1990 and will
double that by 1995.
    Wallin said, "Our objective is to get a hold of new
products and start building market share if we have to beg,
borrow or steal to get into new markets."
    In the past, Medtronic's pacemakers have been plagued with
a number of problems leading to product recalls. Regulators
also have criticized the industry, citing quality problems and
a needless overprescription of pacemakers.
    "We have no knowledge of any major problems in our
pacemakers or leads," Wallin said. "We intend to re-establish
our company as the quality leader in the industry."
    Glen Nelson, executive vice president for Medtronics, said
the company intends to diversify internally and through
acquisitions of companies in areas of Medtronic's expertise,
such as drug delivery systems.
    Wallin said the 15 pct earnings growth for fiscal 1988 does
not include dilutions from acquisitions. "We hope to have some
safety provisions so that we won't have any major dilutions
from an acquisition."
    Wallin also said the company will have virtual exclusivity
in rate responsive pacemakers for all of fiscal 1988.
    The company markets Activitrax, the first single chamber
pacemaker that varies heartrate in response to physical
activity.
    Siemens AG, a West German company, is also developing a
rate responsive pacemaker.

International Business Machines
Corp said IBM vice president Ray S. AbuZayyad has been named
president of its ROLM Corp subsidiary, succeeding Dennis D.
Paboojian, who remains with IBM as a consultant.
    The company said IBM vice president Paul R. Low has been
named president of the IBM General Products Division,
succeeding AbuZayyad, and IBM vice president Michael J. Attardo
has been named president of IBM's General Technology Division,
succeeding Low.
    A Rolm spokeswoman said Paboojian decided to step down for
personal reasons.
    His decision, she said, was not related to IBM's move last
month to merge Rolm's sales and service organization into its
own marketing corps.
    That merger was viewed by some analysts as reducing Rolm's
independence and relegating it to a role as a manufacturing and
product development site within IBM.
    "He wanted to take some personal time off," she said,
adding that Paboojian had taken part in the merger decision.
    Scores of Rolm veterans have left the company, which makes
telephone exchanges and other communications equipment, since
it was acquired by IBM in 1984.
    Rolm's highly respected founder, Ken Oshman, left more than
a year ago.
    Rolm and IBM customers have complained about a lack of
coordination between Rolm and IBM, and analysts estimate the
unit lost money last year.
    But the spokeswoman said Paboojian was "happy with the way
things are going with Rolm." She said the unit posted its best
fourth quarter revenues ever in the 1986 fourth quarter.

General Motors Corp said it set dates to

slated for closure.
    General Motors said its number one line at its Flint,
Mich., truck and bus assembly plant will be closed May 29. The
company said the closing was in line with its announcement last
November that it would close 11 plants. At that time, General
Motors said the line would be closed "by August."
    At Flint, "layoffs could reach 2,000," the automaker said.
Some 1,400 workers on the line will be transferred to other
locations or put in a job placement program. The second line at
the plant is not affected.
    General Motors also said it will close the truck and bus
plant in St. Louis on August seven.
    General Motors did not specify how many of the 2,200
workers at the facility would be laid off, but said "many of
those employees will be transferring toother General Motors
operations in the area."
    In the automaker's previous announcement, it said the
facility would be closed by "mid-1987."
    General Motors said the full-size pickup trucks currently
being built of Flint's Line One are being replaced by a new
full-size pickup truck being assembled at Fort Wayne, Ind., and
at renovated plants in Pontiac, Mich., and Oshawa, Ont.
    The St. Louis plant makes full-size pickup trucks,
including crew cab models. The production is being phased out

General Motors' new redesigned 1988 full-size pickup. Crew cab
truck output is being shifted to Janesvile, Wis.

Controversial plans to pay
Western Europe's surplus-producing farmers generous cash grants
to leave the land ran into problems at today's weekly meeting
of the European Community (EC) Commission, officials said.
    They said the 17-member Commission, which effectively runs
the Community on a day-to-day basis, appeared divided over the
proposals which some people argue could lead to national
capitals having too much say in EC farm policies.
    EC Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen is proposing paying
farmers as much as 2,800 dlrs a year over five years to leave
the land. EC member states would be permitted to top up
payments to the poorest farmers to 80 pct of the average
national farm income.
    The package would also include an early retirement scheme,
details of which have yet to be unveiled.
    Andriessen's aim is to make a restrictive price policy --
the centre-piece of a current battle to curb unwanted food
production -- more acceptable to countries with large farming
communities.
    With two-thirds of the EC's entire 39 billion dlr budget
swallowed up by EC farm supports, he argues that in the
long-run the payments would lead to considerable savings.

Union Texas Petroleum said its worldwide
proved reserves fell to 511 mln barrels of oil equivalent at
the end of 1986 from 555 mln barrels reported in 1985.
    In its newly released annual report, Union Texas said it
replaced about 71 pct of its production of 56 mln barrels of
oil equivalent last year after taking into account the sale of
27 mln barrels of U.S. reserves.
    Union Texas, the nation's largest independent oil and gas
producer based on revenues, is a privately-held company owned
by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Co and Allied-Signal Inc <ALD>.
    The Houston-based company said it lost 57.5 mln dlrs on
1.26 billion dlrs in sales last year, compared to profits of
165 mln dlrs on 2.04 billion dlrs in sales in 1985.
    Union Texas said it received an average of 13.35 dlrs per
barrel for its international oil production and 2.99 dlrs per
mcf for its foreign natural gas sales. The majority of the
company's total energy production is in the United Kingdom,
Indonesia and Pakistan.
    In the United States, Union Texas said it completed
evaluation work on its oil find in Alaska's Colville Delta
area.
    "Although significant oil reserves were confirmed,
development of this discovery will not be economical without
substantially higher prices," the company said.
    Union Texas said it planned to spend about 42 mln dlrs over
the next two years to develop its Eugene Island Block 371 in
the Gulf of Mexico.
    In 1987, the company said it budgeted 178 mln dlrs for
capital spending, less than half of the amount spent in 1985
and down from 199 mln dlrs budgeted last year. Union Texas also
said it would seek acquisitions of oil and gas properties as
well as petrochemical-related businesses.

UAL Inc may have a response this
afternoon to the pilots union proposal to buy its United
Airlines unit, a UAL spokesman said.
    "Obviously, we have a lot of movement in our stock, and we
need to get a clarification out," the spokesman said, adding
that there was a "50-50" chance a statement would be released
today.
    The pilots earlier this week offered to buy the airline for
2.3 billion dlrs, and assume 2.2 billion dlrs of existing debt.
    Takeover speculation has driven UAL's stock for several
weeks. UAL last month said New York Real estate developer
Donald Trump held a position in its stock, and that he also
held discussions with its chairman.
    The developer indicated in those talks that he took the
position as an investment, but he revealed no other plans.
    Today, rumors circulated that Coniston Partners were buying
UAL stock. UAL jumped five to 70-3/4 on volume of more than 3.2
mln shares.
    "United has got to consider this proposal. I think the
pilot's proposal is realistic. I don't exptect them to take it,
but it could put some interesting options in front of UAL
management," said Timothy Pettee, Bear Stearns and co analyst.
    Analysts have said UAL made itself vulnerable to attack
when it diversified away from its core airline. It added Hertz
rental cars, Westin and Hilton International hotels in a
strategy to become a travel service company.
    The strategy left its stock in a slump and its pilots union
concerned that the company was not focussing enough attention
on its airline.
    UAL has stood firm on its strategy. It is emphasizing its
new focus by changing its name to Allegis, as of May one.
    But takeover speculation has escalated, and Wall Street has
been busy calculating break up values well in excess of 100
dlrs per share. Traders today described the buying in UAL as
widespread, indicative to them that big institutions believe
the stock is in play.
    Market sources have said that although Trump attracted
attention to the stock, the pilots proposal acted as a
catalyst, kicking off a new round of speculation and perhaps
throwing the company into the hands of another buyer.
    "The first domino is you have an investor with a
considerable stake. the second domino is the union. That type
of attitude has been a precursor to airline deals in the past,"
said Pettee.
    "What's interesting is the values are there. There's
something for everybody," he said.

goal. In fiscal 1986, ended November 30, 1986, Hartmarx
reported earnings of 24.8 mln dlrs, or 1.20 dlrs a share, down
from the prior year's 42.7 mln dlrs, or 2.25 dlrs a share.

Analysts at Salomon Brothers Inc say
the outlook for stock markets worldwide is postivie, although
total returns in the U.S. stock market are not expected to
exceed 10 pct over the next 12 months.
    The report by Robert Salomon Jr and Caroline Davenport said
that after a strong first quarter, which saw U.S. stock market
indices rise more than 20 pct, the direction of the market is
still upward because slower economic growth will stretch out
the recovery period. The firm expects profits for companies in
the Standard and Poor's 500 stock index to rise 17 pct in 1987
and 18 pct in 1988. 
    The bullish global outlook is underpinned by continued but
subdued economic growth, fiscal restraint, good liquidity and
increasing profits, Salomon said.
    The Salomon analysts say potential risks which must be
monitored include any shift toward protectionism and foreign
buying of U.S. stocks particularly by the Japanese. "A sharp
run-up in stock prices in secondary stocks" would be a warning
sign, as would a big increase in enthusiasm for the initial

Robert Heller, a member of the
Federal Reserve Board, said he expects "more modest levels" of
growth in the money supply this year.
    "In my view, this would not only be a logical, but also a
most desireable development," he said in a speech prepared for
delivery to an economic forum at Chapman College in Orange,
Calif.
    A text was released in Washington.
    He said the effect of lower inflation and financial
deregulation on monetary aggregates was now largely finished.
    "Consequently, monetary growth may return to more modest
levels," Heller said. He noted growth in the money supply slowed
after mid-January.
    "I would not be surprised at all if the monetary aggregates
were to grow rather slowly during the balance of the year as
well," he added.
    Heller said there was a danger of renewed price inflation.
    "The pricing behavior of American producers in response to
price increases of their foreign competitors will be crucial
for our economic future," he said.
    Widespread domestic price rises in response to rising
import prices would "generalize the inflationary forces
emanating from the foreign trade sector" and might not gain more
market share for U.S. producers.
    "A return to the stagflation of the late 1970s may well be
the result of such a behavior pattern," Heller warned.
    He said "we at the Federal Reserve will have to be
disciplined in our conduct of monetary policy." 
    Heller said said the government should also exercise fiscal
discipline and cut the deficit by spending restraint rather
than new taxes.
    "The imposition of new taxes would tend to rekindle
inflation and certainly would not make us more competitive in
international markets," Heller said.
    He said the U.S. economy should expand by nearly three pct
during 1987, aided by higher exports to Europe and Canada.
    A free trade agreement currently being negotiated with
Canada "would be exceedingly helpful in allowing American
producers to compete more effectively in that country," Heller
said.

The U.S. meat and poultry inspection
programs are incapable of protecting consumers from
contaminated products, groups representing inspectors and
consumers charged.
    "The whole trend of inspection for the last 10 years has
been to corrupt and to degrade the system where today the
public is at constant risk to contaminated and adulterated
meat," Kenneth Blaylock, president of the American Federation of
Government Employees, told a House Agriculture subcommittee.
    "The American consumer has little reason to feel confident
about the safety of meat and poultry being offered to him
today," said Rodney Leonard, executive director of the Community
Nutrition Institute.
    "Company management is less concerned about the risk to
health than about raising plant output and company profits,"
Leonard told a hearing of the House Agriculture Subcommittee on
Livestock, Dairy and Poultry.
    Kenneth Morrison, staff associate at the Government
Accountability Project, said inspectors consistently disclose
violations of federal law, demonstrating a "serious breakdown in
the entire inspection system."
    Morrison told of chicken fat for flavoring being
contaminated by "intestines dragging in a water trough used to
flush away the condemned product, fecal material, human spit,
chewing gum and paper towels used by plant employees to blow
their noses."
    Donald Houston, administrator of the U.S. Agriculture
Department's Food Safety and Inspection Service, FSIS, defended
the government's program, calling it "one of the most respected
public health programs in the world."
    FSIS inspects an estimated 127 mln head of cattle and 4.5
billion chicken and turkeys every year.
    Houston said inspection programs have kept pace with
change, but conceded that the danger of chemical residues in
the meat and poultry supply has increased.
    He also said that, although he was confident the bacterium
salmonella eventually could be eradicated, it would take time
and much money to contain the growing problem.
    Salmonella, which in extreme cases can cause death, is
found in approximately 37 pct of U.S. broilers, 12 pct of raw
pork and three to five pct of raw beef, Houston said.
    The number of reported cases has doubled over the past 20
years, he said, to 40,000 cases annually.
    "We certainly really have not found an effective means of
turning this disease around," said Rep. James Olin (D-Va.)
    The National Research Council recommended in 1985 that FSIS
intensify efforts to develop rapid diagnostic procedures for
detecting microoganisms.
    But the meat and poultry industries have said such controls
would cost too much.
    "Hopefully we will not overreact by installing unnecessarily
complicated procedures that may become obstacles to the real
goal of providing an increasingly safer, more nutritious and
economical meat supply for consumers," Stanley Emerling,
executive vice president of the National Association of Meat
Purveyors, said.
    Blaylock, speaking on behalf of food inspectors, said a new
program allowing elimination of USDA inspection functions at
certain plants "voids the law in letter and spirit, and must be
repealed or we will see rising consumer fraud and an epidemic
of death and illness for which there will be no prevention nor
legal recourse."
    Subcommittee Chairman Charles Stenholm (D-Tex.) said the
panel would hold a hearing on salmonella June 2.

Chrysler Corp and Regie Natiionale des
Usines Renault said they agreed to extend by up to two weeks
the period for reaching definitive agreement on Chrysler's
proposed 1.5 billion dlr takeover of American Motors Corp.
    The letter of intent signed by Chrysler and Renault on
March nine set April nine as the target date for completing
negotiations.
    However, the letter also allowed room for an extension of
that date to April 23 if an agreement could not be reached.
    The two companies said they "now plan to complete work by
April 23."
    Chrysler and Renault said, "Given the complex nature of the
deal, the need for additional time was to be expected."
    The March letter of intent between the two companies says
that Chrysler could ask Renault to extend the agreement date
"in the event that prior to April 9, 1987, Chrysler discovers
an unforeseen problem in the course of its 'due diligence'
investigation of the company," referring to American Motors.
    A Chrysler spokeswoman would not say whether some problem
had cropped up in the talks. She stuck by the company's
statement that more time was needed because the talks are
complex. "That is our definition of the delay," she said.
    Under the previous agreement between Chrysler and Renault,
their letter of intent would be terminated on April nine or
when an agreement was reached. But the letter could be amendend
by a written agreement by both companies.
    The Chrysler spokeswoman said, "We are still working toward
a definitive agreement." Said another Chrysler official who is
not part of the talks but who would be told if the deal were in
trouble: "There are no glitches."
    Analysts also downplayed the significance of the delay. "I
can't visualize where they wouldn't want it to be done," said
Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette analyst Richard Henderson.

General Electric Corp said its
first quarter results were significantly higher due to the
strong results of RCA, which was acquired last year.
    General Electric also attibuted continued strong
performances in plastics, major appliances and the Employers
Reinsurance Corp for its strong quarter.
    GE recorded net earnings for the first quarter 1987 of 624
mln dlrs, or 1.37 dls per shr, up 16 pct from 537 mln dlrs, or
1.18 dlrs per share for the same quarter a year ago.
    General Electric chairman John Welch Jr reiterated the
company's outlook for 1987 in which it expects double-digit GE
earnings growth for the year. He said the first quarter results
are in line with those expectations.
    General Electric cited the strong results in TV network and
station operations of the National Broadcasting Co, which was
not part of GE in the first quarter of 1986, as one reason for
its strong earnings.
    It also noted that aircraft engine operating profit was
much higher than a year ago, caused by a increase in shipments
than the 1986 quarter, which was impacted by a strike.
    Aerospace revenues were sharply higher in this year's first
quarter from a year ago, mainly because of the inclusion of
RCA's aerospace and defense business, the company said.
    In addition, consumer products revenues were up from last
year, mainly because of including sales of RCA video products.
    General Electric said restructuring provisions of 308 mln
dlrs before taxes to implement various strategic moves were
charged against operations in the first quarter of 1987. It
added that there was a one-time gain of 281 mlns dlrs after
taxes from an inventory accounting change.
    And technical products revenues and operating profit were
ahead of last year, led by a strong increases in medical
systems volume and the inclusion this year of RCA's
communications and related services.

The European <Airbus Industrie> consortium
today formally signed an agreement with the Franco-U.S. Group
<CFM International> for an improved version of the CFM56-5
engine to power the A340-200 and A340-300 aircraft, an Airbus
statement said.
    Airbus said yesterday that it chosen the CFM56-5-S3 engine,
to be produced by <General Electric> of the U.S. And <SNECMA of
France, because the <International Aero Engine> (IAE) high
technology superfan engine would not be ready by early 1992,
when the A340 plane is due to become operational.
    The five-nation IAE consortium has decided not to go ahead
with the proposed launch of the superfan, a spokesman for
consortium member <Rolls-Royce Plc> said today, adding that the
project had not been cancelled and could be offered later on.
    Airbus said the CFM56-5-S3 will have a thrust of 30,600 lbs
and an improved fuel burn of four per cent compared with the
CFM56-5A1 which is now being operated on the A320 flight-test
aircraft. It will be available for deliveries of the A340 in
May 1992.
    At the same time, the Airbus statement said Airbus
Industrie and General Electric have concluded an accord for an
improved version of the GE CF6-80C2 engine, with 64,000 lbs of
thrust and a three per cent improvement in specific fuel
consumption, to power the A330 aircraft which will be
introduced in spring 1993.
    "This continues the long-standing history of all Airbus
launches being made with either GE or CFMI engines," Airbus
Industrie president Jean Pierson said in the statement.
    "Airbus Industrie has already worked with CFMI to launch one
new aircraft programme - the A320 - in early 1984, and is happy
to build on this relationship by launching the A340 with an
improved version of the same engine," Pierson said.
    Airbus Industrie said it has so far received a total of 128
commitments for the A340 and A330 from nine customers.

    As much as the Fed would like to take a tough line against
inflation, it cannot act to slow the growth of credit without
subverting national U.S. economic policy.
    "On selected occasions when the dollar seems steady, and,
because the trade deficit is not responding, the United States
decided to push Germany and Japan harder to meet their
commitments to economic growth, the Federal Reserve will do its
part by moving rates down," Wojnilower said in a report.
    "Justifiably not anticipating either a recession or
seriously higher interest rates, securities market participants
have seen little to fear," Wojnilower said.
    He said last week's "hiccup" in money and currency rates
and bond and stock prices was probably caused by Japanese
window dressing for March 31 end-of-fiscal-year accounts.
    Wojnilower said the U.S. probably enjoyed above-average
economic growth in the first quarter. However, the pick-up
seems to reflect an unsustainable pace of inventory building
and the prospect for the full year is still for real gross
national product growth of about 2-1/2 pct, he said.

The Senate unanimously approved
legislation to lift a ban on new construction of natural
gas-fired power plants and other large industrial gas-burning
plants.
    The bill, sponsored by Senate Energy Committee chairman
Bennett Johnston, also repeals mandatory incremental pricing of
natural gas which was designed to protect residential consumers
from major price increases by forcing some industrial users to
pay higher than market prices.
    "This legislation will open up new natural gas markets," the
Lousiana Democrat said.
    The gas restrictions were enacted in 1978 in response to a
shortage of natural gas and predictions of higher prices.
    "Now both oil and gas prices are severely depressed,"
Johnston said.
    In a compromise with coal producers, the bill requires new

modifications necessary to burning coal or another alternate

The value of U.S. farmland declined
again last year, but less than in the previous year, the U.S.
Agriculture Department said.
    In a summary of its Agricultural Resources Report, the
department said on February 1, 1987, the average value per acre
of farmland stood at 548 dlrs, down eight pct from a year
earlier. Values dropped 12 pct in 1985, it noted.
    Real values, which are adjusted for inflation, also
declined less than in 1985, because of the low rate of
inflation in 1986.
    Real values fell 10 pct compared to 14 pct in 1985, it
said.
    The department said in the Corn Belt and Northern Plains,
which suffered severe losses in the past five years, declines
appear to be moderating. Also there are reports of stable
values in some areas of the Corn Belt, it noted.
    The continuing downturn in values reflects the large
acreage of land offered for sale relative to demand, concern 
about lower crop prices, and uncertainty over farm programs,
the department said.
    Those factors tend to offset the effects of relatively high
cash farm income, lower interest rates, and reduced operating
expenses, it said.

Williams Cos said it expected oil and
fertilizer transportation volumes to be flat in 1987 but said
operating profits from the pipeline unit should improve from
49.4 mln dlrs earned last year when a seven mln dlr special
charge was incurred.
    Williams Pipeline Co took the charge against earnings in
1986 for the removal of more than 500 miles of old pipeline
from service and for casualty losses. Companywide, Williams had
a net loss of 134 mln dlrs on total revenues of 1.85 billion
dlrs, a decline from profits of 32 mln dlrs on sales of 2.46
billion in 1985.
    In its annual report, Williams said its Northwest Pipeline
Corp and Williams Natural Gas Co had natural gas costs that are
among the lowest in the nation, averaging 2.04 dlrs and 2.07
dlrs per mcf, respectively, last year. Total natural gas
reserves for both units declined to 10,010 billion cubic feet
in 1986 from 11,334 billion cubic feet the previous year.
    The company said its Williams Natural Gas unit, which has
less take-or-pay exposure than most major pipelines, should
show improvement in its 1987 operating results because of
changes tariff and federal tax rates.
    The company's gas marketing business is expected to have
somewhat lower earnings in 1987 because of competition in its
operating region, the annual report said. The gas marketing
unit earned 26.0 mln dlrs on sales of 285.6 mln dlrs last year.
    Williams also said it expected a substantial decline in its
debt to equity ratio this year because of more than 250 mln
dlrs received in cash from the sale of Agrico Chemical Co and
proceeds from the sale and leaseback of Williams
Telecommunications Co. The telecommunications business, a
2,000-mile fiber optic system for long distance use, will not
be profitable until late 1988, Williams said.

plan that calls for incurring one billion dlrs of bank and
other debt to finance a 25 dlr per share special dividend and
the repayment of about 222.5 mln dlrs of existing debt.
    It said the plan's terms would violate dividend convenants
in the rated debt's indentures and likely force refinancing of
those issues. Caesars was placed on creditwatch for a possible
downgrade March nine following investor Martin Sosnoff's bid.
    Sosnoff bid 28 dlrs per share, or 725.2 mln dlrs, for the
86.4 pct of Caesars World stock he does not already own,
Standard and Poor's noted.
    The rating agency said an increase in Sosnoff's offer is
possible. If successful, the stock bid would markedly raise
Caesars World's financial risk and lead to a large drop in net
income and cash flow, S and P said.
    Caesars World currently carries BB senior debt and B-plus

    "...there are conditions which may indicate that the
company will be unable to continue as a going concern,"
auditors Deloitte Haskins and Sells said in Hawkeye's annual
report to shareholders.
    Hawkeye reported a 1986 loss of almost 59 mln dlrs, citing
an increase in its loan loss provision to 34.7 mln dlrs and
restructuring costs of 27 mln dlrs.
    However, Hawkeye, with assets of 1.09 billion dlrs at 1986
year end, said it expects "to have sufficient cash to meet its
obligations for the next 12-month period."
    Last July the bank holding company reached a debt
restructuring agreement which identifed 17 bank subsidiaries
and five non-bank operations for disposition.
    "The restructuring has improved Hawkeye's financial
condition, but it does not assure that Hawkeye will be able to

with provisions of the debt restructuring and regulatory

dlrs bid for Chesebrough-Ponds Inc when Unilever N.V. agreed to

speculating that American Brands would find another candidate
to help reduce its earnings exposure to tobacco.
    "This is just typical," said George Thompson of

tobacco is still a significant part of earnings. Their position

type of acquisition they envisioned.
    "The distilled spirits business has been in a steady
gradual decline for sometime, as has the tobacco business,"
said Thompson.

Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler
called on central banks of major industrialised nations to
cooperate closely on exchange and interest rate policies.
    In a lecture at the University of Surrey, pre-released
here, Koehler said that the only alternative to cooperation was
protectionism and control on capital movements.
    "Central banks have sufficient experience of exchange market
transactions to steer exchange rates where they want to have
them," he said. He added that West German growth forecasts would
have to be revised downward because of the recent dollar drop
to 1.80 marks from above two marks at the start of 1987.
    Koehler said that transactions on foreign exchange markets
had parted company with transactions in goods, services and
investments. It was the scale of speculative transactions that
determined market trends.
    Speculative inflows could cause monetary aggregates to
grow. To reverse such a rise in the money stock, interest rates
would have to be lowered to allow funds to drain off.
    "In other words, the monetary policy measures required are
different from -- and sometimes diametrically opposed to --
those needed when the money stock is increasing as a result of
mounting economic activity," Koehler said.
    The dollar fall was one means of reducing the massive U.S.
Current account deficit. But attempts to keep the depreciation
going by talking the dollar down posed problems.
    The sharp drop of the dollar had led to an immediate steep
rise in the cost of U.S. Imports and a sharp fall in the cost
of European imports. But the volume effect of falling imports
to the U.S. And rising imports to Europe would take time to
make itself felt compared with the price effect.
    "Hence the depreciation of the dollar may well be going
further than would be necessary to adjust the current account
over the medium term," Koehler said.
    A reduction in the U.S. Current account deficit would occur
only if the growth rate of GNP was higher than domestic demand.
In Japan and West Germany by contrast, domestic demand should
rise faster than GNP.
    "In Germany this did indeed happen in 1986," Koehler said.
    If a further appreciation of the dollar was to be
prevented, the U.S. Current account deficit could be offset by
an inflow of foreign funds into the U.S..
    But only if there was an appropriate interest rate
differential would Europe and Japan look for financial
investment in the U.S.
    When selecting monetary policy instruments, a central bank
had to pay greater heed than in the past to the impact its
measures might have on expectations and consequent decisions.
    Koehler said the Bundesbank was changing money market rates
by operating on the open market rather than adjusting leading
interest rates because of the signal this gives to the market
and its substantial impact on exchange rates.
    It was not only important to achieve the domestic goals of
price stability, economic growth and full employment but also
to tackle international problems like the exchange rate
problem, the debt problem and the current account problem.
    A strategy had to be designed that helped "the safeguarding
of non-inflationary economic growth in an international
monetary system largely free of disruptions," Koehler said.
    Given the system of floating exchange rates, it was
necessary for central banks to agree to intervene. It sufficed
to tell the market where central banks saw exchange rates over
the next few years and intervention points should not be set,
because they were only testing points for the market, he said.
    In order to keep the international monetary system free of
disruptions central banks should not only intervene jointly but
also cooperate on interest rate policies, Koehler said.

Remarks by two leading central bankers
sparked renewed speculation in financial markets that a cut in
the West German three pct discount rate may be under
discussion, currency dealers said.
    Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler said in a speech that
monetary growth resulting from speculative capital inflows
required cuts in interest rates.
    Separately, West Berlin state central bank president Dieter
Hiss told journalists that the discount rate could fall below
its lowest ever point of 2.75 pct. He made clear that he was
not making a forecast on interest rates, however.
    Currency dealers here and in the Far East said the dollar
gained slight background support from the speculation.
    But German dealers noted that the Bundesbank kept the 3.80
pct rate unchanged at which it offered liquidity to the money
market this week, dashing some expectations that it may either
offer lower fixed rate money or offer a reduced minimum rate
and let the strength of banks' demands set the allocation rate.
    It allocated 6.1 billion marks in new liquidity, much less
than the 14.9 billion leaving the market as a prior pact
expired. This further weakened sentiment the Bundesbank could
move to a more accommodative monetary stance, dealers said.
    Koehler said in a speech in Surrey, England, speculative
capital inflows may cause monetary growth, regardless of
whether central banks intervened or exchange rates fell.
    "In other words, the monetary policy measures required are
different from -- and sometimes diametrically opposed to --
those needed when the money stock is increasing as a result of
mounting economic activity."
    Though Koehler was known to be the most liberal of the
generally monetarist Bundesbank board, his comments marked the
first time cuts in rates had been concretely suggested as a
counterpoint to overly strong monetary growth, dealers said.

The statement issued today by the Group of
Seven (G-7) industrialised nations has put Japan under greater
international pressure to stimulate its economy or face a
further rise in the yen, private economists and analysts said.
    They said the communique reflected increased foreign
frustration with Japan's burgeoning trade surplus and its
tight-fisted fiscal policies in the past.
    Unless Japan implements economic measures included in the
statement, foreign protectionist sentiment would grow and the
yen would come under renewed upward pressure, they said.
    The G-7 -- grouping the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain,
France, Italy and Canada -- said in the statement they welcomed
proposals announced by Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party
(LDP) for extraordinary and urgent measures to stimulate its
economy and that Japan reaffirmed its intention to further open
its domestic markets.
    "It's rather unusual that only Japan was mentioned in the
communique and promised something," said Takeshi Saito, general
manager of Fuji Bank Ltd's research division. This showed how
strongly other nations want Japan to take concrete and
effective steps to redress its trade surplus, he said.
    The statement referred to some details of Japan's proposed
economic measures, such as early implementation of a large
supplementary budget exceeding those of previous years and
unprecedented front-end loading of public works expenditures.
    It did not mention any figure for the projected
supplementary budget but LDP officials have said it will amount
to more than 5,000 billion yen for fiscal 1987, which compares
with 2,000 billion provided for the previous year.
    "It signalled a clear shift away from the conservative
fiscal policies of the past," said Kazuaki Harada, senior
managing director of Sanwa Research Institute.
    For the last five years the government has stuck to a
tight-fisted fiscal policy in its attempt to stop issuing
deficit financing bonds by 1990.
    But mounting foreign pressure for Japan to boost its
economy, hurt by the yen's extended rise, hurried the
government to hammer out a draft economic package and bring it
to the latest G-7 meeting.
    Harada said Japan should not view expansion of its economy
as the result of pressure but as an opportunity to lead world
economic growth.
    "The Japanese economy has the potential to take a leadership
role and we should recognize it," Harada said.
    If Japan fails to meet such international expectations it
will invite some retaliatory moves, especially from the U.S.,
Which may result in a further rise of the yen, analysts said.
    The G-7 communique represented a test for Japan's
commitment to domestically-generated economic growth and to a
more balanced world trade structure, they said.

Japan, which has been accused of dumping
everything from steel to computer microchips on world markets,
is now under attack for alleged cut-throat selling of a product
of a different sort -- banking services.
    At meetings here this week, Bank of England officials
pressed their Japanese counterparts to change regulations that
foreign bankers say give their Japanese rivals an unfair
advantage in world financial markets.
    The technical banking talks coincided with, but were
separate from, discussions between Japanese officials and
British corporate affairs minister Michael Howard, who left
Tokyo yesterday for South Korea.
    At the crux of the talks was the way regulators in various
countries measure bank capital and how much capital banks must
put up to back up their loans.
    It is generally agreed that shareholders' equity forms the
bulwark of bank capital but there is disagreement about what
else should be included.
    Some foreign bankers contend that their Japanese rivals can
undercut them on loans and other banking services because
Tokyo's capital regulations are easier to meet.

Remarks by central bankers raised some
hopes the Bundesbank will cut rates on securities repurchase
pacts, but operators remained divided on the likelihood of a
move in the near term, money market dealers said.
    Comments by Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler yesterday
that rate cuts were needed to curb money supply growth from
speculative capital inflows, and by West Berlin state central
bank president Dieter Hiss that there was no natural lower
limit to the discount rate had, however, no immediate impact.
    Call money declined to 3.65/75 pct from 3.75/85 pct but the
drop was tied to extra liquidity in the market, dealers said.
    Dealers said the Bundesbank's latest liquidity allotment
this week dashed some hopes of lower rates.
    The Bundesbank allotted only 6.1 billion marks yesterday in
new liquidity in a repurchase pact at an unchanged rate of 3.80
pct, thus subtracting some 8.8 billion marks from the market,
as an outgoing 14.9 billion pact expired.
    But some dealers said the smaller volume awarded by the
pact was in line with present liquid money market conditions,
and did not exlude a cut in the repurchase pact rate soon to
3.70 pct if money market rates continue at present levels.
    The next opportunity for the Bundesbank to lower rates on
repurchase pacts will be in a tender expected next Tuesday.
    Bundesbank officials have already said they favour more
discreet rate adjustments through repurchase pacts, rather than
the more public adjustment of leading rates.
    The Bundesbank may either set a fixed allocation rate and
allow banks to tender for the volume, as has been the case
since it lowered its discount rate January 22, or else it may
allow banks to tender for the rate and set the volume itself.
    Dealers expect volume of the tender to be lower than the
15.2 billion marks flowing out, to offset other incoming funds.
    Some seven billion marks is expected to flow in next week.
This should then flow back into the market as it is deposited
with banks.
    Banks were well supplied with liquidity, holding 61.5
billion marks in reserves at the Bundesbank on Tuesday.
    Holdings of average daily reserves over the first seven
days of April stood at 59.6 billion marks, still above the
estimated 51 billion required for all of April.

The leaders of two of Japan's top business
groups said in separate statements the Group of Seven (G-7)
accord reached in Washington yesterday is of deep concern to
Japan because it shows the major industrial nations regard the
yen's current level as appropriate.
    Eishiro Saito, chairman of the Federation of Economic
Organizations (Keidanren), said the yen's present rate is well
above adequate levels. He did not elaborate.
    Takashi Ishihara, chairman of the Japan Committee for
Economic Development, said the accord will not prevent the yen
from rising further.
    "We do not understand why the G-7 approved present rates as
the yen has risen excessively since the Paris accord," Ishihara
said.
    G-7 members Britain, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, the U.S.
And West Germany said in a statement they consider their
currencies are now within ranges broadly consistent with
economic fundamentals.
    Saito called on each G-7 member nation to prepare to
intervene in the market strongly enough to ensure exchange
rates are stabilised at appropriate levels.

The statement issued today by the Group of
Seven (G-7) industrialised nations has put Japan under greater
international pressure to stimulate its economy or face a
further rise in the yen, private economists and analysts said.
    They said the communique reflected increased foreign
frustration with Japan's burgeoning trade surplus and its
tight-fisted fiscal policies in the past.
    Unless Japan implements economic measures included in the
statement, foreign protectionist sentiment would grow and the
yen would come under renewed upward pressure, they said.
    The G-7 -- grouping the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain,
France, Italy and Canada -- said in the statement they welcomed
proposals announced by Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party
(LDP) for extraordinary and urgent measures to stimulate its
economy and that Japan reaffirmed its intention to further open
its domestic markets.
    "It's rather unusual that only Japan was mentioned in the
communique and promised something," said Takeshi Saito, general
manager of Fuji Bank Ltd's research division. This showed how
strongly other nations want Japan to take concrete and
effective steps to redress its trade surplus, he said.
    The statement referred to some details of Japan's proposed
economic measures, such as early implementation of a large
supplementary budget exceeding those of previous years and
unprecedented front-end loading of public works expenditures.
    It did not mention any figure for the projected
supplementary budget but LDP officials have said it will amount
to more than 5,000 billion yen for fiscal 1987, which compares
with 2,000 billion provided for the previous year.
    "It signalled a clear shift away from the conservative
fiscal policies of the past," said Kazuaki Harada, senior
managing director of Sanwa Research Institute.
    For the last five years the government has stuck to a
tight-fisted fiscal policy in its attempt to stop issuing
deficit financing bonds by 1990.
    But mounting foreign pressure for Japan to boost its
economy, hurt by the yen's extended rise, hurried the
government to hammer out a draft economic package and bring it
to the latest G-7 meeting.
    Harada said Japan should not view expansion of its economy
as the result of pressure but as an opportunity to lead world
economic growth.
    "The Japanese economy has the potential to take a leadership
role and we should recognize it," Harada said.
    If Japan fails to meet such international expectations it
will invite some retaliatory moves, especially from the U.S.,
Which may result in a further rise of the yen, analysts said.
    The G-7 communique represented a test for Japan's
commitment to domestically-generated economic growth and to a
more balanced world trade structure, they said.

    The firm's suit alleges that Lotus' spreadsheet program
1-2-3 violates the copyright of VisiCalc, which was developed
by SAPC several years ago, before 1-2-3 was introduced, when
the firm was known as Software Arts Inc.  Software Arts sold
rights to VisiCalc to Lotus in 1985 and changed its name.
    The suit also alleges that Lotus founder Mitchell D. Kapor,
who resigned as chairman in July 1986, breached a
confidentiality agreement with SAPC.  Kapor, also named as a
defendant, had worked for a firm that had marketing rights to
VisiCalc before founding Lotus.
    The suit alleges that Lotus and Kapor deliberately sought
to make 1-2-3 look and feel like VisiCalc by copying a number
of commands, keystrokes and screen displays.
    Lotus, in response, said it feels the suit is without merit.

    The company said the loss followed four quarters of modest
profits. In the year ago quarter it earned 11,000 dlrs, or one
cent a share. For the first half of fiscal 1987, it reported a
profit of 42,000 dlrs, or two cts a share, compared to a year
earlier loss of 294,000 dlrs, or 17 cts a share.
    It said President Michael R. Hall will assume the duties of
chief executive officer.
    Physio Technology said the resignation of Chairman James C.
Lane can constitute non-compliance with its Series A
convertible subordinated debentures due 1996 and a default
under its agreement with the Merchants Bank of Kansas City.
    It explained a declaration of non-compliance under the
debentures would create a a default under the loan agreements

about 450,000 dlrs outstanding under the bank credit line.

The global economy is expected to
weaken this year, adding new worries to an already serious
poverty outlook, economic analysts said.
    For finance ministers and central bankers attending this
week's semi-annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund
and World Bank, the new figures released by the IMF add an
additional concern.
    The Fund estimated world output would only grow by 2.7 pct
this year, versus 2.9 pct last year, and 3.1 pct in 1985.
    In the industrial countries, Gross National Product, a
measure of all goods and services, was expected to decline to
2.3 pct this year, compared with 2.4 pct in 1986, the IMF said.
    For the developing countries, the Gross Domestic Product,
another measure of economic growth, was expected to fall to 3.0
pct from 3.5 pct last year.
    The new figures are considered a major disappointment to
the poorest countries. They had hoped that new vitality in the
industrial countries brought on by a sharp decline in oil
prices would assist their economic recovery and help them cope
with growing mounds of debt.
    IMF officials, discussing their outlook, said they believed
the industrial country economies would move up to an annual
growth rate of three pct by the end of the decade.
    Economic analysts and the IMF have been saying for some
time that the ability to keep the debt crisis from turning into
an economic rout rests on sustained economic growth.
    Since the debtor countries must look to the wealthier
states for markets for their products as well as financial
assistance, economic weakness in the developed nations' 
economies poses fundamental worries.
    Debtor countries, including the very poorest states, have
only a few avenues open to them for earning foreign exchange,
including the key one of exports.
    The U.S. economy, which is in its fifth year of expansion,
has served as a mainstay for developing country exports, but it
too is seen as being rather feeble this year, growing by only
2.3 pct, according to the IMF.
    For this reason and because of a high trade deficit, the
United States has been pressuring Japan and West Germany to
ignite their economies but with little apparent success.
    The IMF study also examines the course of the dollar and
the curious lack of impact it has had on the U.S. trade
deficit.
    Reagan administration officials have been saying that the
impact is now beginning to show up, although it has been much
slower than expected.
    The IMF observed in its World Economic Outlook that "it has
to be recognized that exchange rate adjustments take time to
work through to payments flows -- probably at least three years
to get a resonably complete effect."
    The report added, however, "the adjustments may take even
more time on this occasion."

Lead prices have risen this week against
a background of a finely balanced physical sector, traders
said.
    Further gains are possible if the USSR steps up its buying
or if labour problems develop in North America, they added.
    London Metal Exchange (LME) prices are unusually buoyant at
a time of year when seasonal demand is normally slackening and
prices tending to drift lower.
    This buoyancy is generally attributed by traders to the low
level of LME stocks and steady, if unspectacular, physical
demand in the Northern Hemisphere finding supplies curtailed.
    The supply problems are not new but are beginning to be
felt by a market in which, as peak winter demand tails off,
stocks usually build fast and availability increases, traders
said.
    The lower supply levels result from a number of different
factors around the globe.
    Delayed shipments from Peru to Mediterranean countries
because of production and transport problems, lack of Spanish
exports since the closure last year of Cia La Cruz's smelter at
Linares and lower output in Morocco and Greece have all meant
additional demand being directed to merchants who in turn have
been drawing on LME stocks.
    In addition Broken Hill Associated Smelters' Port Pirie,
South Australia, smelter is halting production for five weeks
for maintenance. Although the company said it would meet
commitments, this will put further pressure on stocks.
    And the U.S. Company Doe Run has kept its 140,000 tonnes
per year Boss, Montana smelter closed. This cut producer stocks
and contributed to a closer supply/demand balance within the
U.S. Market, for many years depressed by surplus production and
a regular supplier to the world market.
    Mexican supplies, which have sometimes swelled LME stocks,
have been normal but are finding ready buyers, traders said.
    On the demand side, winter battery manufacture has held up
quite well and some U.S. Buying of lead sheet has been reported
in the U.K. Soviet lead buying, notably absent in Europe in the
first two months of the year, was resumed when a large buying
order was filled by merchants in March.
    Merchant demand has fuelled the rise in LME lead prices
this week and has seen cash metal move above 320 stg and
establish a premium of around 10 stg over three months
delivery. Specific demand has been directed towards metal in
Gothenburg and Trieste warehouses. Gothenburg material is often
a target for merchants shipping to the USSR, traders said.
    On stocks, the popular LME Continental warehouses, Antwerp
and Rotterdam, have little more than 3,000 tonnes of lead each,
and this is believed to be in strong hands.
    Out of a total 22,125 tonnes in LME stocks, the lowest
level since June 1980, just over half is in U.K. Warehouses
which are not popular with merchants putting together
shipments.
    But even U.K. Stocks have dropped around 6,000 tonnes since
the start of the year. Traders said this is partly due to
secondary smelters buying ingots to supplement feed supplies
affected by environmental controls, which put restrictions on
the transport of used batteries.
    Labour negotiations in North America will play an important
part in determining the direction of prices, with contracts
expiring end-April at Cominco's Trail and Kimberley, B.C.,
Mine/smelter and at Doe Run's Herculaneum, Mo, smelter.
    Noranda's New Brunswick mine/smelter also has a contract
expiry in July which may cause some nervousness in view of
strikes by its zinc and copper workers over recent months.
    Traders said LME three months delivery, already attracting
speculative buying, could rise to 320/330 stg on current
firmness, while nearby tightness could widen the cash premium
to 20 from four. Three months was quoted at 313 stg at
midsession.

Reichhold Chemical Inc said its
board adopted a warrant dividend plan in which one preferred
stock purchase right will be distributed as a dividend on each
common share outstanding.
    The company said its warrant dividend plan is designed to
protect its shareholders against unsolicted, coercive attempts
to aquire control without making an adequate offer for all
shares.
    Reichhold said the adoption is not a response to any
specific takeover attempt.
    Reichhold said each right will entitle shareholders to buy
one one-hundreth of a share of a newly created series of
preferred stock at an initial exercise price of 120 dlrs, with
dividend and voting rights approximately equal to those of one
share of the company's common stock.
    The rights will be exercisable only if, without Reichhold's
prior consent, a person or group a acquires 20 pct or more of
the voting power or announces a tender offer which would result
in 20 pct ownership, the company said.
    Reichhold said it is entitled to redeem the rights at five
cts apiece before a 20 pct position has been acquired, or
before an existing 20 pct shareholder buys an additional two
pct or more of the voting power of the company, or in
connection with certain transactions afterward.
    The tax-free distribution will become effective May 1,

Losses for Volkswagen AG
<VOWG.F>, VW, linked to an alleged foreign currency fraud will
not exceed the 480 mln marks provision already made, a VW
spokesman said.
    The spokesman was commenting after VW had confirmed it
would pay an unchanged 10 mark dividend for ordinary shares on
1986 business, despite the provision.
    One West German newspaper today quoted foreign currency
dealers in Frankfurt as speculating that the total losses from
the currency affair could be as high as 1.5 billion marks, but
the VW spokesman described 480 mln marks as an "upper limit."
    VW said in a statement following today's supervisory board
meeting that it had discussed the foreign currency scandal in
detail, and was setting up a new probe into its foreign
currency activities to be carried out by an unnamed auditing
company.
    VW has said computer programs were erased and documents
were faked in the alleged fraud in which it believes
transactions intended to protect it against possible foreign
currency losses were not completed.
    VW's former foreign currency chief Burkhard Junger was
arrested on Monday on suspicion of embezzlement and of having
evaded justice.
    Earlier VW had said that its 1986 results would match 1985
profits. VW's group net profit in 1985 was 596 mln marks and
parent company net was 477 mln marks. It also said it recommend
an unchanged dividend to the supervisory board. The company has
also set a dividend of 11 marks for new preference shares,
which were issued last year. Analysts have described the held
dividend as a move to reassure worried shareholders.
    VW increased nominal capital by 300 marks last year to 1.5
billion marks, with the result that its total dividend payment
on 1986 will be 306 mln marks compared with 240 mln on 1985,
since the new capital was in preference shares.
    The share analysts say VW will have to dig into reserves in
order to maintain the disclosed 1986 profit at 1985 levels. At
the end of 1985, VW had parent company reserves of slightly
less than three billion marks.

AMR Corp, the parent of American
Airlines, rose sharply in active trading after analyst Roland
Moreno of Smith Barney upgraded his opinion of the stock to buy
from accumulate and added it to the brokerage house's
recommended list, traders said.
    AMR climbed 1-3/8 to 55-5/8.
    A spokeswoman for Smith Barney said the recommendation was
made because the airline group looks cheap relative to the
broad market and the analyst feels AMR is the best in the
group.
    In a related action, Moreno downgraded his opinion of UAL
Inc <UAL> to accumulate from buy and took it off the firm's
recommended list, Smith Barney's spokeswoman said. The stock
slipped 1/2 to 71-1/2 on volume of 1.3 mln shares.
    She said the Moreno's downgrade of UAL was because the
"stock had risen to a level beyond what current fundamentals
can support." The stock has risen more on merger speculation
than on fundamentals, the opinion continued.
    In recent weeks, rumors UAL stock was being accumulated for
a possible takeover bid shored up the stock, traders and
analysts said. In addition, pilots of UAL's United Airlines
unit proposed a buyout of the airline for 4.5 billion dlrs.
    The Smith Barney spokeswoman said the postive
recommendation of AMR emphasizes the company's strong marketing
ability, its good management and customer loyalty to the AMR
name. She said the company has been the best financial
performer of the airline group.
    The AMR recommendation includes earnings expectations of
4.35 dlrs a share in 1987 as compared to earnings of 4.63 dlrs
a share last year, the spokeswoman said. In 1988, the company
is expected to earn six dlrs a share.
    Traders said other airline stocks moved higher today
primarily as a result of fare hikes announced Wednesday by
Texas Air <TEX>, United Airlines and AMR.
    Delta <DAL> rose 1/2 to 56-7/8, NWA Inc <NWA> 3/8 to 66,
and Pan Am <PN> 1/8 to 4-5/8.

Trading on the London potato futures
market will not be suspended, Richard Harris, Chairman of the
London Potato Futures Association (LPFA), said in a statement
to floor members.
    It was in response to strong representations by the Potato
Marketing Board (PMB) complaining of a gross distortion of
price which they say will result in large deliveries into the
physical market when the April futures position expires.
    The PMB had sought an immediate suspension in futures
trading and asked the LPFA to take action to restore the
relationship between futures and physicals.
    Farmers and merchants have alleged a squeeze and cornering
of the market but Harris pointed out that recent investigations
by the Association of Futures Brokers and Dealers (AFBD), the
International Commodities Clearing House (ICCH) and other
parties, found no evidence to substantiate this.
    The main complaint from some sections of the physical
market is what they say is an unrealistic futures premium over
the PMB's average ex-farm price. April futures traded this
morning between 168 and 170 stg per tonne compared with PMB's
average price of 104 stg.
    Bill Englebright, joint secretary of the LPFA said there is
a two-tier market for physical potatoes. He said quality
potatoes are in short supply and prepackers have been paying
between 145 and 165 stg per tonne for best samples. But lesser
quality grades have traded below 100 stg.
    Some merchants fear that a large tonnage will be delivered
against the April futures contract between now and the end of
the month, and possibly disrupt the physical market.
    Harris said the LPFA rule book allows the management
committee to take steps as necessary to correct any malpractice
and he assured the committee is monitoring the situation.

Steel stocks, which have had a healthy
runup recently, still present some short term investment
opportunities, according to some steel analysts.
    But others say the upturn, based on strong orders and firm
prices this spring, has been strictly seasonal and will end
soon. They recommend taking profits.
    "It's that time of year. This is strictly seasonal," said
Charles Bradford of Merrill Lynch and Co. "Orders will be
strong for about two months, and there are signs that some
(order rates) are starting to dive already."
    But Dean Witter Reynolds Inc analyst Clarence Morrison sees
some short-term potential in the group, which includes USX Corp
<X>, Bethlehem Steel Corp <BS>, Armco Inc <AS> and Inland Steel
Industries Inc <IAD>.
    "There is still some attractiveness to steels over the
short- to intermediate-term based on improved order rates and
rising prices," Morrison said. He only recommends one stock,
however, Inland, which is modernizing steelmaking operations to
make them more efficient.
    Despite his bearishness, Merrill's Bradford continues to
recommend Armco, which he sees as a major turnaround.
    Armco's steelmaking operations are profitable, the balance
sheet has been improved, and its oilfield equipment business
has been slimmed and put in a joint venture with USX, Bradford
noted. "It's not a high-quality investment situation yet but
they've come a long way," he said.
    "We think the stock will do moderately better than the
market," he said. Armco shares, trading off 1/4 at 10 today,
could go to 12, and possibly as high as 15, he said.
    Bradford sees Armco earning 50 to 75 cts a share in 1987,
before special gains from recouped investment tax credits,
against losses last year.
    Armco's 1988 earnings could be significantly higher, he
said.
    Bradford is recommending sale of USX shares. "We had a buy
on it below 20 but when it gets to 28, let somebody else have
it," he said.
    The steel and energy concern will earn about one dlr a
share in 1987, about half of that coming from asset sales, and
from two dlrs to 2.50 dlrs in 1988, Bradford said. "But a lot
depends on oil prices," he added. About 60 pct of USX's sales
come from oil and natural gas.
    Other analysts, including Michelle Galanter Applebaum of
Salomon Brothers Inc, recommend USX. "The company's done a lot
(of restructuring), more than the market's given them credit
for," she said.
    She sees the stock going to the mid 30s or higher. USX was
trading up 1/8 at 28-1/2. She predicts USX will earn 18 cts a
share this year and 2.73 dlrs next year against large losses in
1986.
    Applebaum, who is also positive on Armco and Inland, has
been recommending the stocks since last November.
    Peter Marcus of Painewebber Inc is neutral on the group
although he said the earnings outlook is improved through the
third quarter.
    But he sees potential trouble beyond then. "I think (steel)
prices on a bookings basis will start to drop by the summer,"
he said.
    Applebaum of Salomon Brothers also sees some seasonal
dropoff later in the year. "But there are more positives than
negatives," she said, citing reduced capacity in the domestic
industry, better prices, and a weaker dollar, which should
cause steel imports to drop off slightly from last year.

Treasury Secretary James Baker said
that changes in exchange rates have generally been orderly and
have improved the prospects for a reduction in external
imbalances to more sustainable levels.
    In remarks before the IMF's policy-making Interim
Committee, Baker reiterated a Group of Seven statement last
night that the substantial exchange rate changes since the
Plaza agreement 18 months ago have "now brought currencies
within ranges broadly consistent with economic fundamentals."
    Baker said, "These exchange rate shifts have generally been
orderly, and have improved prospects for the reduction of
external imbalances to more sustainable levels."
    As they are today, the trade and current account imbalances
"simply are not sustainable," Baker told the ministers.
    He said that the Reagan administration was resisting "strong
domestic pressure" for trade protection and was working closely
with the U.S. Congress in crafting a trade bill.
    "While we cannot yet be sure of the outcome, we are doing
what we can to ensure that the bill is not protectionist," he
said.
    Baker also urged the International Monetary Fund's
executive board to review possible modifications to the Fund's
compensatory financing facility before the annual meeting this
fall.
    "We should pay particular attention to the lack of
continuing conditionality associated with the use of the CFF
and to whether shortfalls in export earnings are indeed
temporary," he said.

National Distillers and Chemical Corp
expects to realize a second quarter after-tax gain of four dlrs
per share from the 545 mln dlr sale of its spirits business to
American Brands Inc <AMB>.
    National Distillers' stock rose 1-1/8 to 65-1/2, after an
opening delay on the New York Stock exchange for an imbalance
of orders.
    "I think the sales price was higher than most people
expected," said John Henry of E.F. Hutton Group.
    A company spokeswoman said the four dlr per share gain will
be included in second quarter net, which compares with 31 cts
per share last year, including the spirits and wine business
    "They netted over 700 mln dlrs for spirits and wine. That
will ease their interest cost burden," said Henry.
    National Distillers sold its wine business last month to
Grand Metropolitan PLC's Heublein Inc for 128 mln dlrs.
    Henry said he had anticipated National Distillers would net
only 600 mln dlrs at the most from the sale of the two liquor
businesses.
    Henry said the company recovered from the sales the cost of
buying Enron Chemicals in the fourth quarter last year.
National Distillers paid 570 mln dlrs cash for Enron and
assumed 34 mln dlrs in debt. National Distillers said at the
time it bought Enron it would sell the spirits and wine
businesses, moving more into the chemical area.
    For 1986, two thirds of income were from chemicals and
propane. National Distillers earned, excluding the liquor
businesses, 2.21 dlrs per share for 1986. Income from
discontinued operations, including the liquor businesses, was
67 cts per share.

Lloyd's of London has offered to meet
part of the 235 mln stg in claims that investors in PCW
Underwriting Agencies face due to fraud and mismanagement,
chairman Peter Miller said at a press conference.
    Miller urged 3,000 PCW members to accept the offer so that
the five-year-old affair could be closed.
    The members have until May 30 to accept the offer,
involving a 103 mln stg payment by Lloyd's and some of Lloyd's
underwriters in exchange for a 34 mln stg contribution from PCW
members, he said.
    Miller said that at end-1985, PCW syndicates had gross
liabilities of 680 mln stg.
    To offset this, they had assets, including cash and
payments from reinsurance policies on some of the risks
underwritten by the syndicates, of 445 mln stg, leaving net
liabilities of 235 mln, he said.
    The total sum on offer, including a 48 mln stg payment from
Lloyd's 311 mln stg contingency fund and 55 mln stg from
Lloyd's brokers who could otherwise face court cases for their
involvement in PCW, is designed to cover the full reinsurance
cost for those 235 mln stg of net liabilities, Miller said.
    Under the offer, which requires 90 pct acceptance, Lloyd's
itself would take over all members' future obligations
connected with the PCW syndicates, Miller said. Members would
have to agree not to pursue the matter in court.
    Miller said a rejection of the offer would probably lead to
protracted litigation in court which, even if succesful for
members, was unlikely to produce a better deal for them.
    He added that acceptance would mean members could continue
underwriting in the Lloyd's market and qualify for tax relief
on the cash payments they would make towards the settlement.
    Miller denied that PCW members would face bills of over
200,000 stg.
    He said only 34 members would be asked to pay between
100,000 and 200,000 stg, and about 100 between 60,000 and
100,000 stg. Special arrangements would be sought for those who
accept the offer but are unable to pay.
    Miller said the offer did not imply Lloyd's accepted
responsibility for the affair, uncovered in the late autumn of
1982 when "it became quite clear that (PCW agency founder) Peter
Cameron Webb and (his partner) Peter Dixon had perpetrated
theft upon members," he said.
    Part of the sum involved was subsequently recovered and
repaid to members, but Cameron Webb and Dixon left the affairs
of PCW syndicates "in a state of chaos which led to a sharp
deterioration of their underwriting results," Miller said. Both
were fined by a Lloyd's disciplinary committee and expelled
from membership.
    He said Lloyd's would continue to seek reparation in
British and U.S. Courts "with the utmost vigour ... To bring to
a close one of the most shameful episodes in the history of
Lloyd's," and was contemplating claiming the full amount of the
settlement now on offer from Cameron Webb and Dixon.
    In a reaction, insurance brokerage Sedgwick Group Plc
<SDWK.L> said it supported Lloyd's proposals and had
contributed 10 mln stg towards the proposed settlement.
    It said in a statement, "as largest broker in the Lloyd's
market, the company has an essential interest in maintaining
the reputation of the market. That reputation has been damaged
by problems at PCW and will continue to be so as long as they
remain unresolved." It had contributed to the proposed
settlement to avoid costs related to the defence of some of its
subsidiaries which had been named as potential defendants to
litigation by PCW members, it said.

Avions Marcel Dassault-Breguet Aviation
<AVMD.PA> has offered the French Defence Ministry a new design
of its Rafale fighter which is lighter and less detectible by
radar, a company spokesman said today.
    The new version would weigh between 8.5 and nine tonnes
unarmed against 9.5 tonnes for the existing Rafale-A
demonstrator which first flew last year, he said.
    The Rafale-D design calls for special paints and materials
to absorb radar signals, as well as smoother contours and
electronic counter-measures.

A key U.S. lawmaker in the securities
field said the insider trading scandal gripping Wall Street
reflects the attitude of the Reagan administration.
    "They don't ask the question, 'Is it right or is it wrong?'
They ask the question, 'Can you pull it off?'" Rep Edward Markey
(D-Mass) told a state securities administrators meeting here.
    Markey, Chairman of the House telecommunications and
finance subcommittee which oversees U.S. securities markets,
said this ethic permeated Wall Street as well as the Reagan
administration.
    He cited as examples a number of administration officials
tainted by charges of wrongdoing including ex-Reagan advisor
Michael Deaver, former national security aide John Poindexter
and former Environmental Protection Agency official Rita
Lavelle.
    Some Wall Street critics have blamed the insider trading
scandal on the so-called "Yuppie mentality", in which young
professionals strive for financial reward and neglect social
values.
    But Markey said the inspiration for this attitude came from
the administration.

     Analysts generally average the sales results of March and
April to account for the variation of Easter's occurance. This
year, Easter is being observed on April 19, which is three
weeks later than last year.
    Analyst Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook Associates said
sales for March rose an unadjusted 2.5 to 3.0 pct, and a
seasonally adjusted 5.5 pct to six pct, compared to an adjusted
5.7 pct last year.
    "The obvious question is whether these numbers indicate
that the consumer activity is slowing, but it does not appear
to be because liquidity and employment are rising," said
analyst Jeff Edelman, analyst of Drexel Lambert and Burnham.
    Overall, analysts said first half sales are coming in
according to expectations. Sales for all of 1987 are expected
to rise about 5.5 pct to six pct, up a bit from 1986's rise.
     In March, sales of housewares, furniture and big ticket
items were stronger than apparel sales, signaling to many
analysts that apparel sales will be strong in April as the
holiday nears.
    "Sales gains in home appliances and home fashions reflect a
continuing strength in the housing market," said Edward
Brennan, chairman of Sears Roebuck and Co <S> which reported an
overall sales gain of 4.2 pct. Brennan said sales of women's
sportswear were also excellent.
    "Sears' total apparel sales was up only modestly, but even
a modest improvement in apparel is a very good accomplishment
due to the fact that most people will buy apparel in April,"
said C.J. Lawrence analysts Harry Mortner. 
    J.C. Penney Co Inc <JCP> and Dayton Hudson Corp <DH> were
among the weaker performers with comparable stores sales
declining 1.5 pct and 4.9 pct, respectively. Penney's store and
catalog sales declined 1.3 pct overall and Dayton Hudson's
overall sales rose 4.8 pct.
    Penney chairman William Howell said, "Sales continued
strong for catalog operations and, geographically, ranged from
very active in the east to weak in the economically depressed
southwest."
    "Penney's been shifting away from leisure time activity
wear to other apparel lines, which yield higher profit margins,
but are currently hurting sales," said Greenstein of Bear
Stearns.
    Hudson chairman Kenneth Mackes cited the late Easter for
the decline. Edelman of Drexel said that "Hudson had a tougher
comparison because it had an exceptionally good 1986."
    Most analysts agreed that promotions are slightly lower
than last year.
    "Retailers are not planning for much - inventories are
being kept lean, markdowns are lower than last year, but sales
are coming through anyway," said CJ Analyst Harry Mortner.
    Mortner said he expects profits in the first quarter to  
be better than he had originally expected in the beginning of
the year.
    Most retailers report their first quarter in the middle of
May.

Eurodollar bonds closed as much as a full
point lower as the dollar fell to a post-war low against the
yen and interest rates on U.S. Treasuries rose almost to eight
pct.
    The dollar fell to 144.30 yen and recovered only slightly
after foreign exchange traders in New York said the Federal
Reserve intervened to buy dollars for yen.
    But despite the dollar's woes, Japan Development Bank,
wholly owned by the Japanese government, raised 150 mln dlrs in
a seven-year eurobond carrying an eight pct coupon.
    Lead manager for the issue, Bank of Tokyo, said the deal,
at the time of pricing, was to yield 60 basis points over
comparable maturity Treasuries. However, by the close of
trading, that spread had narrowed to 55 and continued to slide
in aftermarket activity.
    Dealers noted that the spread to Treasuries is wide for a
newly-priced AAA-rated borrower like Japan Development Bank.
For example, earlier this week, the World Bank raised U.S. Dlrs
at only 25 basis points over Treasuries. Dealers said that
because the borrower comes to market fairly infrequently -- the
last time was about nine months ago, the spread appears wide.
    But officials at Bank of Tokyo said the spread is intended
to compensate for the lack of liquidity and for the uncertainty
currently associated with owning dollar securities.
    The officials said the borrower opted to raise funds in
dollars, despite the currency's weakness, because it is the
only market deep enough to accommodate an issue of that size.
Japan Development Bank is not allowed to raise euroyen.
    Market sources said the deal is likely to be swapped into
yen as the borrowers previous issues were.
    Late in the day, the deal was trading just inside its fees
at less 1.75 less 1.55.
    Also issued today was a 40 mln dlr five-year offering from
Toshiba International Finance (Netherlands) carrying a 7-3/8
pct coupon and priced at 101-1/2.
    Three equity linked dollar denominated deals were offered,
the largest of which was a 200 mln dlr offering by Sekisui
Chemical Co and guaranteed by Sanwa Bank Ltd. The issue has
equity warrants attached and late in the day it was quoted on
brokers' screens at 106-1/2, bid only.
    The Australian dollar market continued active, with
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce offering a bond of 125 mln
five-year with a zero coupon priced at 54.
    Late in the day, the deal was quoted at less 1-1/4 bid. A
similar deal yesterday by Toronto Dominion, priced slightly
higher at 54.37 pct for an effective yield of 13.52 pct, was
quoted slightly lower at less 1.37 less 1.25 pct.
    Dealers said that investors are apparently willing to
accept zero-coupon bonds yielding 50 to 100 basis points less
than annual-pay bonds because their are tax benefits for retail
buyers. Also, the bonds are more volatile and if interest rates
fall in Australia as many analysts expect, the potential for
capital gains is greater with a zero-coupon. The bonds are also
better for those who expect the australian dlr to appreciate.
    Dealers said that the Australia dlr zero coupon bonds are
apparently being placed with retail accounts on the European
continent with very little placement being done in Japan.
    Euroyen issues sank slightly in line with prices on
domestic Japanese bond markets but recovered in late trade as
the yen soared. After the markets closed, the dollar fell to
144 yen.
    The European Investment Bank (EIB) issued a 40 mln euroyen
issue paying 4-5/8 pct over seven years. This is the second
seven-year yen issue in two days -- a sector of the yield curve
in Japan that dealers feel has not yet become overpriced.

Reducing the amount of crop base a
farmer can receive deficiency payments on is being looked at as
one way to cut the U.S. agriculture budget for fiscal year
1988, congressional aides and lobbyists said.
    Rep. Charles Stenholm (D-Tex.) has suggested that the
planted crop base a producer receives deficiency payments on be
reduced by five pct, an aide to Stenholm said.
    The aide said no official proposal has yet been drawn up,
but that as it becomes more clear exactly how much agriculture
spending will have to reduced, specific numbers will be
discussed and a proposal could "very likely" be drafted.
    Under the proposal, if a farmer idled 20 pct of his acreage
base and was eligible to plant the remaining 80 pct, he would
receive payments on only 75 pct of his total base.
    Current regulations provide farmers with deficiency
payments on 100 pct of their non-idled acreage.
    Reducing the payment base by five pct could save around 400
to 500 mln dlrs, but would have to be applied to the 1987 crop
programs in order for any savings to accrue in fiscal year
1988, an Agriculture Department economist said.
    Stenholm's aide said when the proposal is officially
offered, it would likely be an amendment to the budget
reconciliation bill.
    Other options currently being talked about as a way to cut
one to two billion dlrs from the farm budget include increasing
acreage reduction programs, limiting farm payments,
implementing a 0/92 acreage set-aside program or limiting the
use of generic in-kind certificates.

    Earlier it posted net income for the period of 14.7 mln

    The provision for loan losses for the first quarter was
eight mln dlrs compared to 11 mln a year ago. Net loan charge
offs were six mln dlrs, down from 11 mln dlrs a year ago.
    The reserve for loan losses was 78.1 mln dlrs, or two pct

A further cut in West German taxes to
overcome the current weakness of the domestic economy has been
called for by Thomas Wegscheider, management board chairman of
Bank fuer Gemeinwirtschaft AG.
    He said in  an interview due in tomorrow's Die Welt
newspaper that tax cuts already decided by the government
should be expanded by implementation of the "Stability Law,"
which allows tax cuts of up to 10 pct for a limited period.
    Wegscheider also said a temporary rise in state borrowing
resulting from such cuts would be tolerable, according to
excerpts of his remarks released early by Die Welt.
    In line with a pledge made at the Paris monetary conference
in February, the government announced in March that 5.2 billion
marks worth of tax cuts would be added on to reductions of some
nine billion marks already scheduled for next year.
    Wegscheider said the Bundesbank should pursue its policies
aimed at lower interest rates and said a reduction in money
market rates could encourage private capital market investment.
    Earlier today the Bundesbank's vice-president Helmut
Schlesinger said the central bank saw no current reason to

Guinness Plc <GUIN.L> director Thomas
Ward told a High Court hearing that the company's action
against him and ex-chairman Ernest Saunders sought to give the
impression of an international hunt for Ward's 5.2 mln stg fee
in connection with the Distillers Co Plc <DIST.L> takeover, the
Press Association news agency reported.
    In a sworn statement, Ward, a U.S. Lawyer, said Guinness
had failed to acknowledge that his attornies in March had
offered to put the money, less tax and various expenses, into
an escrow account where it could only be touched under agreed
circumstances.
    Ward said Guinness had made a transparent attempt to
belittle his services, the PA reported.
    "I wish to emphasise that the fee paid for my services was,
when considered out of context, admittedly very large."
    But every aspect of the (Distillers) bid - the size of the
target, the benefit to Guinness from success, the potential
damage from failure, the difficulties of the issues raised and
the cost for all services - were not merely large but virtually
unprecedented in the history of English takeovers," Ward said.
    Failure would have cost Guinness between 25 mln stg and 100
mln stg, he added.
    Ward said it was his idea to have a merger agreement with
Distillers under which Distillers agreed to pay Guinness's bid
costs, the PA reported.
    Ward's statement was read to the court by his lawyer Peter
Curry. Ward and ex-Guinness chairman Saunders want to end a
temporary court freeze of their assets up to the disputed
amount of the 5.2 mln stg fee which Guinness is trying to
recover.
    Guinness acquired Distillers in a fierecly fought 2.7

Rep. John Porter, R-Ill., introduced
in the House of Representatives legislation proposed by the
Reagan administration to slash the U.S. sugar price support, a
spokesman for Porter said.
    The spokesman said the bill was introduced without any
changes from the administration's proposal sent to Congress
last month.
    That plan calls for a cut in the sugar loan rate to 12
cents per pound from 18 cents now. Sugar growers would be
compensated for the price cut with targeted direct payments,
to be gradually phased-out through 1990. The payments to
growers would cost an estimated 1.1 billion dlrs.
    Representatives of sugar growers have rejected the
proposal, saying it would ruin the domestic sugar industry.

U.K. Property company Greycoat Group Plc
is seeking two financings, one for 120 mln stg and the other
for 16 mln stg, in connection with its Embankment Place
development above and around Charing Cross station in London,
banking sources said.
    The first transaction, a 120 mln stg credit, will be
arranged by N.M. Rothschild and Sons Ltd and Bank of Tokyo
International Ltd on behalf of a special purpose Greycoat
subsidiary yet to be incorporated.
    It matures in June 1993 but will be extendible by up to two
years to June 1995 at the option of the borrower.
    The first credit, a project financing, will carry a basic
margin of 5/8 point over London Interbank Offered Rates
(LIBOR), with an additional 1/4 pct per annum payable on
outstanding amounts to the extent that the property is not
substantially pre-let.
    In addition, if the property is pre-sold while amounts are
still outstanding, the basic margin will be reduced to 1/2
point over LIBOR, the banking sources said.
    For a one year extension of the maturity an extra 1/8 point
margin will be paid, with a further 1/8 point if the maturity
is lengthened for the optional second year.
    There will be a commitment fee of 1/4 pct per annum on
available amounts and of 1/8 pct on unavailable amounts, the
sources said. Rothschild is sole agent for this transaction.
    The second transaction, a 16 mln stg credit for the purpose
of working capital, is being arranged by Rothschild alone on
behalf of the Greycoat Group Plc itself. It will be secured on
a property called Brettenham House.
    The margin will be 1/2 point over LIBOR in years one to
four, 5/8 point over LIBOR in years five and six and 3/4 point
over LIBOR thereafter. The credit will mature in June, 1995.
    The sources said that a commitment fee of 20 basis points
will be payable on the available tranche, with 10 basis points
on unavailable amounts.

    The company said first quarter costs fell to 25.4 mln dlrs

and reduced depletion because of its fiscal 1986 writedown.
    First quarter revenues fell to 14.7 mln dlrs from

Texaco Canada Inc, 78 pct owned by
Texaco Inc <TX>, likely would not form any part of a possible
settlement in a 10.3 billion U.S. dlr legal battle between
Texaco Inc and Penzoil Co <PZL>, Texaco Canada chief executive
Peter Bijur told reporters.
    "I just just don't believe that it (Texaco Canada) would be
part of any settlement," Bijur said during a interview.
    Bijur said he could not comment directly on the
Texaco-Penzoil dispute, adding he had no first-hand information
concerning efforts by Texaco and Penzoil to resolve the matter.
    "We don't have any problems that I am aware of that are a
result of that litigation in the United States, and we continue
to do business on a normal, 'business as usual' basis," Texaco
Canada's Bijur told reporters during an interview session.
    As previously reported, Texaco Inc is seeking a court order
to block Pennzoil from taking action to secure a 10.3 billion
dlr judgement against Texaco.
    In reply to a query, Bijur said Texaco Inc has imposed no
spending retraints on Texaco Canada as it continues previously
reported efforts to make an energy-related acquisition.
    After considering making an acquisition for several months,
Texaco Canada set up a "business development team" of five people
about one month ago to increase its efforts, Bijur said. The
company has also widened the scope of its search to include
candidates involved in refining and marketing as well as
production segments of the industry.
    "We're going to widen the scope of our view. We're going to
look at the downstream and we're going to look at the entire
petroleum business," he said.
    Bijur declined to specify how much money Texaco Canada
would spend on an acquisition.
    Bijur said the company was not close to concluding any
acquisitions and declined to specify when he expected a
transaction might be made. "We're not in a hurry," he said.
    Texaco Canada said in the annual report it had a cash
position of 808 mln dlrs at the end of 1986, and Bijur said the
company's cash fund has not changed materially during the first
quarter.
    Commenting on earnings results, Bijur said he expected
first quarter profit to be lower than last year's earnings of
84 mln dlrs or 70 cts a share, due to lower profit contribution
from production because of lower oil prices.

function.
    Effective May four, House of Seagram said its sales force

five in open states and two in control states, Seagram said.
    The change reflects a more aggressive marketing and sales
focus on the local level, the company said.

coolers, the be caled the Seagram Beverage Co, will not be

Canada's trade picture has brightened
considerably, underscoring economists' predictions the sector
would post a long awaited recovery this year.
    The federal government reported today that the monthly
surplus soared to 1.25 billion Canadian dlrs in February,
double January's 623 mln dlrs surplus and sharply higher than
February 1986's 189 mln dlr tally.
    "Hopefully it's the beginning of a trend," said Richardson
Greenshields of Canada Ltd economist Susan Clark in Toronto.
    Economists generally don't expect such large gains over the
next months, but are looking for an upward trend throughout the
year.
    "We thought the trade balance would improve ... over the
year, and it certainly looks as if this morning's figure is
indicative of that," commented economist James Donegan at the
Toronto securities firm of Midland Doherty Ltd.
    Statistics Canada reported the surplus was driven by a 23
pct gain in automobile product exports to a record 3.2 billion
dls in the month.
    "Recovery in the automotive sector helped push the value of
exports up by 5.9 pct in February," the agency said in its
monthly report.
    Total exports expanded to 10.44 billion dlrs from 9.85
billion dlrs in February, while imports slipped to 9.19 billion
dlrs from 9.23 billion dlrs.
    Economists have predicted the 1987 trade surplus would end
up three to five billion dlrs higher than last year's dismal
10.1 billion dlr total. In 1985 the surplus was 17.48 billion
dlrs.
    Money market analysts said the positive trade news touched
off a modest rally in the Canadian dollar, which rose to 76.85
U.S. cts on North American markets early this morning after
closing at 76.58 cts Wednesday.
    The currency was hovering around 76.78 cts in early
afternoon trading.
    Economists have been banking on an improved trade
performance this year to stimulate an otherwise sluggish
Canadian economy.
    Money market analysts said the positive trade news touched
off a modest rally in the Canadian dollar, which rose to 76.85
U.S. cts on North American markets early this morning after
closing at 76.58 cts Wednesday.
    The currency was hovering around 76.78 cts in early
afternoon trading.
    Economists have been banking on an improved trade
performance this year to stimulate an otherwise sluggish
Canadian economy.
    They say the country's consumers, who have been spending at
a torrid pace in recent years, will sharply curtail outlays
this year and this should help curtail the flow of imports into
the country.
    Meanwhile, demand for Canadian exports in the United
States, by far the country's largest market, is expected to be
strong as a result of a projected rise in American consumer
spending and the relatively low value of the Canadian currency.
    "We maintain what's going to drive Canada's export
performance is income growth in the U.S.," said Midland's
Donegan.
    But at the Bank of Nova Scotia, deputy chief economist
Warren Jestin was less optimistic about the U.S. outlook and
said it could be a mistake to read too much into February's
trade upturn.
    Jestin said, "Given the fact the U.S. economy is showing
signs of weakening--particularly car sales--it would indicate
that part of the strength (in Canada's trade figures) is
probably transitory."

Robert Salomon, managing director of
Salomon Inc, said rumors the Wall Street firm suffered bond
trading losses in the first quarter are not true.
    Salomon said the rumors affected the company's stock and 
are "unequivocally denied."
    The Salomon share price was off 5/8 at 37-1/2, but it had
been off more than one dlr on heavy volume earlier in the day.
    Analysts said the rumors have been circulating in the
market for several days.
   
    Salomon said the firm will report first quarter results on
April 22 or 23.
    Analysts said the stock would have reacted poorly today,
even without the rumors, because of the decline in the stock
and bond markets.
    Other brokerages were also down today. E.F. Hutton <EFH>
fell one to 41-1/4. Bear Stearns and Co <BSC> slipped 3/8 to
19-1/2. PaineWebber Group <PWJ> fell 1/2 to 36, and First

Clevite Industries Inc, which
earlier received a 96 mln dlr takeover offer from J.P.
Industries Inc <JPI>, said it amended its Shareholder Rights
Plan so that certain provisions of the plan cannot occur until
the board determines that it is in the best interests of the
company and stockholders.
    The plan, adopted in December 1986, permits Clevite to
issue shares at half price to existing stockholders and allows
stockholders to buy shares of an unfriendly bidder at half
price.
    Clevite said the amendments by its board effectively mean
that the so-called flip-in and flip-over provisions of its
rights plan can only be triggered by affirmative board
approval.
    The company said it acted inview of the proposed
acquisition and because certain debt restrictions could block
its ability to redeem the rights.
