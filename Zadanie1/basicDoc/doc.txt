Dean Foods Co expects earnings for the
fourth quarter ending May 30 to exceed those of the same
year-ago period, Chairman Kenneth Douglas told analysts.
    In the fiscal 1986 fourth quarter the food processor
reported earnings of 40 cts a share.
    Douglas also said the year's sales should exceed 1.4
billion dlrs, up from 1.27 billion dlrs the prior year.
    He repeated an earlier projection that third-quarter
earnings "will probably be off slightly" from last year's 40
cts a share, falling in the range of 34 cts to 36 cts a share.
    Douglas said it was too early to project whether the
anticipated fourth quarter performance would be "enough for us
to exceed the prior year's overall earnings" of 1.53 dlrs a
share.
    In 1988, Douglas said Dean should experience "a 20 pct
improvement in our bottom line from effects of the tax reform
act alone."
    President Howard Dean said in fiscal 1988 the company will
derive  benefits of various dairy and frozen vegetable
acquisitions from Ryan Milk to the Larsen Co.
    Dean also said the company will benefit from its
acquisition in late December of Elgin Blenders Inc, West
Chicago.

countries access to technology that could further their

technology, technology that is truly critical, we will do a
better job of preventing diversion of critical technology to
our adversaries while promoting more exports," Cranston said.

ChemLawn Corp <CHEM> could attract a
higher bid than the 27 dlrs per share offered by Waste
Management Inc <WNX>, Wall Street arbitrageurs said.
    Shares of ChemLawn shot up 11-5/8 to 29-3/8 in
over-the-counter- trading with 3.8 mln of the company's 10.1
mln shares changing hands by late afternoon.
    "This company could go for 10 times cash flow or 30 dlrs,
maybe 32 dollars depending on whether there is a competing
bidder," an arbitrageur said. Waste Management's tender offer,
announced before the opening today, expires March 25.
    "This is totally by surprise," said Debra Strohmaier, a
ChemLawn spokeswoman. The company's board held a regularly
scheduled meeting today and was discussing the Waste Management
announcement. She said a statement was expected but it was not
certain when it would be ready. 
    She was unable to say if there had been any prior contact
between Waste Management and ChemLawn officials.
    "I think they will resist it," said Elliott Schlang,
analyst at Prescott, Ball and Turben Inc. "Any company that
doesn't like a surprise attack would."
    Arbitrageurs pointed out it is difficult to resist tender
offers for any and all shares for cash. Schlang said ChemLawn
could try to find a white knight if does not want to be
acquired by Waste Management.
    Analyst Rosemarie Morbelli of Ingalls and Snyder said
ServiceMaster Companies L.P. <SVM> or Rollins Inc <ROL> were
examples of companies that could be interested.
    ChemLawn, with about two mln customers, is the largest U.S.
company involved in application of fertilizers, pesticides and
herbicides on lawns. Waste Management is involved in removal of
wastes.
    Schlang said ChemLawn's customer base could be valuable to
another company that wants to capitalize on a strong
residential and commercial distribution system.
    Both Schlang and Morbelli noted that high growth rates had
catapulted ChemLawn's share price into the mid-30's in 1983 but
the stock languished as the rate of growth slowed.
    Schlang said the company's profits are concentrated in the
fourth quarter. In 1986 ChemLawn earned 1.19 dlrs per share for
the full year, and 2.58 dlrs in the fourth quarter.
    Morbelli noted ChemLawn competes with thousands of
individual entrepreuers who offer lawn and garden care sevice.

A surprise 7.5 pct drop in U.S. January
durable goods orders points to a slowdown in capital spending
that could presage lackluster real growth in the U.S. economy

    With total orders, excluding the volatile defense sector,
falling a record 9.9 pct, economists agreed that the report
painted a bleak picture for the U.S. economy.

primary factor behind the drop in orders for business capital
investment.
    "It's a rather gloomy outlook for the economy, said David
Wyss of Data Resources Inc. "I'm particularly impressed by the
19.7 pct drop in non-defense capital goods orders because it
may be a sign that businesses are reacting more adversely to
tax reform than we thought."
    The Commerce Department pointed out that a record 14.8 pct
decline in new orders for machinery was led by declines in
office and computing equipment orders.
    Economists said the drop in computer orders may have been a
response to the lengthening of depreciation schedules and the
end of the investment tax credit under the new tax laws.
    "It's more expensive to invest than it used to be, so
people just aren't doing it as much," Wyss said.
     Increases in durable goods orders at year's end reinforced
the view that businesses anticipated the changing tax laws,
economists said.
    November durable goods orders rose 5.1 pct and December's
increased 1.5 pct, revised upwards from a previously reported
0.9 pct.
    But most acknowledged that the huge January drop was caused
by more than tax reform.
    "The wash-out that took place in January was far greater
than the actual gains that took place in November and
December," said Bill Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. "The
economy has a weakening bent to it early in the year."
    "The report definitely points to very sluggish capital
spending over the next couple of quarters," said Donald Maude
of Midland Montagu Capital Markets Inc.
    Maude pointed to a continuing decline in order backlogs as
evidence that the outlook for new orders is not improving. In
November, order backlogs rose 0.6 pct, but in December they
fell 0.6 pct and in January 0.7 pct, he said.
    "It suggests orders in the pipeline are depleting, which
may quickly translate to a drop in production," Midland
Montagu's Maude said.
    Wyss cautioned that too much should not be made of
January's report, given that other reports have reflected
strength.
    But he acknowledged that the decline occurred despite a 51
pct rise in defense orders, compared with a 57.7 pct decline in
December.
    He also noted that there was a 6.9 pct drop in January
shipments, compared with a 5.4 pct rise in December.
    "Given these numbers, there's no reason for the Fed to
tighten," Data Resources' Wyss said.
    "But there's no reason to ease unless we see more numbers
like this. The Fed will wait and see," he added.
    Sullivan predicted the Fed will ease by Easter. "People
aren't talking recession or Fed easing now, but the Fed will
have to ease to ensure global growth."

Sens. Alan Cranston (D-Cal.) and
Daniel Evans (R-Wash.) said they introduced export licensing
reform legislation that could save U.S. companies hundreds of
thousands of dollars annually.
    "Our emphasis is two-fold: Decontrol and de-license items
where such actions will not endanger our national security, and
eliminate the Department of Defense's de facto veto authority
over the licensing process," Cranston said.
    "Our reforms should reduce licensing requirements by 65  to
70 pct," he told reporters. "I am convinced that a more
rational...licensing process will boost exports."
    U.S. export controls are intended to deny Eastern bloc
countries access to technology that could further their
military capabilities.
    "By refocusing our control resources on higher levels of
technology, technology that is truly critical, we will do a
better job of preventing diversion of critical technology to
our adversaries while promoting more exports," Cranston said.
    "We cannot expect to continue to play a leading role in new
technology development in the future if we unduly restrict the
activities of U.S. firms in the world market-place," Evans told
reporters.

AM International Inc, reporting an
operating loss for the January 31 second quarter, said
prospects for the balance of the fiscal year remain good.
    It said orders at its Harris Graphics subsidiary, acquired
in June 1986, "continue to run at a strong pace." For the six
months, orders rose 35 pct over the corresponding prior-year
period, or on an annualized basis are running at about 630 mln

    The backlog at Harris is up 30 pct from the beginning of
the fiscal year, AM said.
    AM International said its old division are expected to
benefit from recent new product introductions and the decline

    "Research, development and engineering expenditures in
fiscal 1987 will be in the 45-50 mln dlr range, and the company
said it has allocated another 30-40 mln dlrs for capital

The chairmen and senior Republican
members of the House and Senate tax writing committees proposed
legislation to curb estate tax deduction on sales of stock to
an employee stock ownership plan.
    The proposal would raise federal revenues of 6.7 billion
dlrs over the fiscal year period 1987 to 1991.
    If adopted by Congress it would effect all transactions
after Sept 26, 1987.
    The plan was proposed by House Ways and Means Committee
Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill), Rep John Duncan (R-Tenn),
Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex) and Sen
Bob Packwood (R-Ore).
    In a statement Rostenkowski said the estate tax deduction
enacted last year as part of the tax reform bill was too broad
and would have cost the governmet seven billion dlrs over four
years. The narrower deduction would cost the government less
than 300 mln dlrs for the same years.
    He said it was designed to avoid sham transactions which
allowed estates to avoid taxes by transferring stock to ESOPs.
    Senate Finance Committee chairman Lloyd Bentsen said in a
statement, "The Tax Reform Act contains a provision that allows
many wealthy individuals to avoid the federal estate tax
entirely when they die."
    He added, "The provision was intended to encourage estates
to sell stock to employee stock ownership plans as a way of
promoting worker ownership; however, the provision was not
meant to be broad enough to reduce federal revenues as much as
is currently estimated."
    He added, "The bill I have introduced today calls for the
modification of the provision in accordance with its intended
purpose."

U.S. bank discount window borrowings
less extended credits averaged 310 mln dlrs in the week to
Wednesday February 25, the Federal Reserve said.
    The Fed said that overall borrowings in the week fell 131
mln dlrs to 614 mln dlrs, with extended credits up 10 mln dlrs
at 304 mln dlrs. The week was the second half of a two-week
statement period. Net borrowings in the prior week averaged 451
mln dlrs.
    Commenting on the two-week statement period ended February
25, the Fed said that banks had average net free reserves of
644 mln dlrs a day, down from 1.34 billion two weeks earlier.
    A Federal Reserve spokesman told a press briefing that
there were no large single day net misses in the Fed's reserve
projections in the week to Wednesday.
    He said that natural float had been "acting a bit
strangely" for this time of year, noting that there had been
poor weather during the latest week.
    The spokesman said that natural float ranged from under 500
mln dlrs on Friday, for which he could give no reason, to
nearly one billion dlrs on both Thursday and Wednesday.
    The Fed spokeman could give no reason for Thursday's high
float, but he said that about 750 mln dlrs of Wednesday's
float figure was due to holdover and transportation float at
two widely separated Fed districts.
    For the week as a whole, he said that float related as of
adjustments were "small," adding that they fell to a negative
750 mln dlrs on Tuesday due to a number of corrections for
unrelated cash letter errors in six districts around the
country.
    The spokesman said that on both Tuesday and Wednesday, two
different clearing banks had system problems and the securities
and Federal funds wires had to be held open until about 2000 or
2100 EST on both days.
    However, he said that both problems were cleared up during
both afternoons and there was no evidence of any reserve
impact.
    During the week ended Wednesday, 45 pct of net discount
window borrowings were made by the smallest banks, with 30 pct
by the 14 large money center banks and 25 pct by large regional
institutions.
    On Wednesday, 55 pct of the borrowing was accounted for by
the money center banks, with 30 pct by the large regionals and
15 pct by the smallest banks.
    The Fed spokesman said the banking system had excess
reserves on Thursday, Monday and Tuesday and a deficit on
Friday and Wedndsday. That produced a small daily average
deficit for the week as a whole.
    For the two-week period, he said there were relatively high
excess reserves on a daily avearge, almost all of which were at
the smallest banks.

American Express Co remained silent on
market rumors it would spinoff all or part of its Shearson
Lehman Brothers Inc, but some analysts said the company may be
considering such a move because it is unhappy with the market
value of its stock.
    American Express stock got a lift from the rumor, as the
market calculated a partially public Shearson may command a
good market value, thereby boosting the total value of American
Express. The rumor also was accompanied by talk the financial
services firm would split its stock and boost its dividend.
    American Express closed on the New York Stock Exchange at
72-5/8, up 4-1/8 on heavy volume.
    American Express would not comment on the rumors or its
stock activity.
    Analysts said comments by the company at an analysts'
meeting Tuesday helped fuel the rumors as did an announcement
yesterday of management changes.
    At the meeting, company officials said American Express
stock is undervalued and does not fully reflect the performance
of Shearson, according to analysts.
    Yesterday, Shearson said it was elevating its chief
operating officer, Jeffery Lane, to the added position of
president, which had been vacant. It also created four new
positions for chairmen of its operating divisions.
    Analysts speculated a partial spinoff would make most
sense, contrary to one variation on market rumors of a total
spinoff.
    Some analysts, however, disagreed that any spinoff of
Shearson would be good since it is a strong profit center for
American Express, contributing about 20 pct of earnings last
year.
    "I think it is highly unlikely that American Express is
going to sell shearson," said Perrin Long of Lipper Analytical.
He questioned what would be a better investment than "a very
profitable securities firm."
    Several analysts said American Express is not in need of
cash, which might be the only reason to sell a part of a strong
asset.
    But others believe the company could very well of
considered the option of spinning out part of Shearson, and one
rumor suggests selling about 20 pct of it in the market.
    Larry Eckenfelder of Prudential-Bache Securities said he
believes American Express could have considered a partial
spinoff in the past.
    "Shearson being as profitable as it is would have fetched a
big premium in the market place. Shearson's book value is in
the 1.4 mln dlr range. Shearson in the market place would
probably be worth three to 3.5 bilion dlrs in terms of market
capitalization," said Eckenfelder.
    Some analysts said American Express could use capital since
it plans to expand globally.
    "They have enormous internal growth plans that takes
capital. You want your stock to reflect realistic valuations to
enhance your ability to make all kinds of endeavors down the
road," said E.F. Hutton Group analyst Michael Lewis.
    "They've outlined the fact that they're investing heavily
in the future, which goes heavily into the international
arena," said Lewis. "...That does not preclude acquisitions and
divestitures along the way," he said.
    Lewis said if American Express reduced its exposure to the
brokerage business by selling part of shearson, its stock might
better reflect other assets, such as the travel related
services business.
    "It could find its true water mark with a lesser exposure
to brokerage. The value of the other components could command a
higher multiple because they constitute a higher percentage of
the total operating earnings of the company," he said.
     Lewis said Shearson contributed 316 mln in after-tax
operating earnings, up from about 200 mln dlrs in 1985.

Thomson McKinnon Mortgage Assets Corp, a

collateralized mortgage obligations in three tranches that
include floating rate and inverse floating rate CMOS.
    The floating rate class amounts to 60 mln dlrs. It has an
average life of 7.11 years and matures 2018. The CMOs have an
initial coupon of 7.0375 pct, which will be reset 60 basis
points above LIBOR, said sole manager Thomson McKinnon.
    The inverse floater totals 4.8 mln dlrs. It has an average
life of 13.49 years and matures 2018. These CMOs were given an
initial coupon of 11-1/2 pct and priced at 104.40.
    Subsequent rates on the inverse floater will equal 11-1/2
pct minus the product of three times (LIBOR minus 6-1/2 pct).
    A Thomson officer explained that the coupon of the inverse
floating rate tranche would increase if LIBOR declined. "The
yield floats opposite of LIBOR," he said.
    The fixed-rate tranche totals 35.2 mln dlrs. It has an
average life of 3.5 years and matures 2016. The CMOs were
assigned a 7.65 pct coupon and par pricing.
    The issue is rated AAA by Standard and Poor's and secured

OPEC may be forced to meet before a
scheduled June session to readdress its production cutting
agreement if the organization wants to halt the current slide
in oil prices, oil industry analysts said.
    "The movement to higher oil prices was never to be as easy
as OPEC thought. They may need an emergency meeting to sort out
the problems," said Daniel Yergin, director of Cambridge Energy
Research Associates, CERA.
    Analysts and oil industry sources said the problem OPEC
faces is excess oil supply in world oil markets.
    "OPEC's problem is not a price problem but a production
issue and must be addressed in that way," said Paul Mlotok, oil
analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc.
    He said the market's earlier optimism about OPEC and its
ability to keep production under control have given way to a
pessimistic outlook that the organization must address soon if
it wishes to regain the initiative in oil prices.
    But some other analysts were uncertain that even an
emergency meeting would address the problem of OPEC production
above the 15.8 mln bpd quota set last December.
    "OPEC has to learn that in a buyers market you cannot have
deemed quotas, fixed prices and set differentials," said the
regional manager for one of the major oil companies who spoke
on condition that he not be named. "The market is now trying to
teach them that lesson again," he added.
    David T. Mizrahi, editor of Mideast reports, expects OPEC
to meet before June, although not immediately. However, he is
not optimistic that OPEC can address its principal problems.
    "They will not meet now as they try to take advantage of the
winter demand to sell their oil, but in late March and April
when demand slackens," Mizrahi said.
    But Mizrahi said that OPEC is unlikely to do anything more
than reiterate its agreement to keep output at 15.8 mln bpd."
    Analysts said that the next two months will be critical for
OPEC's ability to hold together prices and output.
    "OPEC must hold to its pact for the next six to eight weeks
since buyers will come back into the market then," said Dillard
Spriggs of Petroleum Analysis Ltd in New York.
    But Bijan Moussavar-Rahmani of Harvard University's Energy
and Environment Policy Center said that the demand for OPEC oil
has been rising through the first quarter and this may have
prompted excesses in its production.
    "Demand for their (OPEC) oil is clearly above 15.8 mln bpd
and is probably closer to 17 mln bpd or higher now so what we
are seeing characterized as cheating is OPEC meeting this
demand through current production," he told

The chairman of the Senate Agriculture
subcommittee on credit said the panel will consider a farm
credit rescue package by Easter even if the system and its
regulator do not ask for help by then.
    "We're going to have a bill to markup, I guarantee you,
before the Easter recess," Sen. David Boren (D-Okla.) said.
    Senate Majority leader Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.) wants
recommendations on farm credit presented by April 11, when
Congress is scheduled to break for Easter, Boren said.
    Boren urged the Farm Credit Administration (FCA), the
system's regulator, to quickly make a formal request for aid.
    Under the 1985 Farm credit law passed by Congress, the FCA,
as regulator, is to certify when the system has exhausted all
its capital and needs federal government help.
    However, FCA chairman Frank Naylor said because much of the
system's remaining capital is tied-up in legal action,
he could not technically certify a rescue is needed this year
and perhaps not even in 1988. The other Republican member of
the three-man FCA board, Marvin Duncan, agreed.
    But Boren urged that even if FCA cannot technically certify
aid is needed, it should request help informally.
    "We all know we need a capital infusion," Boren said.
    Boren and the FCA officials spoke at a hearing on the
plight of the farm credit system. Also at the hearing, Brent
Beesely, chief executive of the Farm Credit Council
representing the system, said that at the end of 1986 the
system had only 1.5 billion dlrs in working capital remaining
after losses of 4.6 billion dlrs over the last two years.
    While he did not ask for government aid, Beesley indicated
the situation is serious in some of the 12 system districts.
    "A significant number of banks and associations in the most
economically depressed areas have and will continue to suffer
extraordinary losses," Beesley said.
    Jim Billington, Democratic member of the FCA board, said
the troubles of the system have encouraged the flight of some
one billion dlrs per month from the system as borrowers repay
loans.
    The system's total portfolio shrank to 54.6 billion dlrs by
the end of last year from 66.6 billion the previous year.
    FCA board members said both borrowers and holders of bonds
in the system need to be assured their money is safe. Naylor
suggested the need for a federal assurance to bondholders.
    "The bondholders have no worry at this time," Billington
said.
    Naylor said several proposals for revamping the farm credit
system are circulating. The proposals range from consolidation
of the system into a centralized national lender, to
de-centralizing into semi-independent institutions.
    But He and the system spokesman Beesley were cautious about
proposals for a secondary market on farm loans. Those
proposals would package farm loans for resale to investors.
    Naylor and Beesley said a secondary market set-up outside
the farm credit system would hurt the system. But Beesley said
a secondary market with the farm credit system as its agent
could be developed without Congressional legislation.

The Tower Commission's scathing   
comments on President Reagan's embattled chief of staff Donald
Regan could signal the death knell to his White House tenure,
but the impact of its strong criticism on two other top
officials was less clear.
    Regan has come in for tough criticism for his handling of
Reagan's worst political crisis since details of the covert
arms sales to Iran and diversion of profits to Nicaraguan
rebels first emerged last November.
    But criticism of the roles of Secretary of State George
Shultz and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, who said they
opposed the Iran arms initiative yet failed to end it, had been
muted until the release of the Tower Commission report.
    "Their obligation was to give the president their full
support and continued advice with respect to the program or, if
they could not in conscience do that, to so inform the
president," the report said after a three-month probe.
    "Instead, they simply distanced themselves from the program.
They protected the record as to their own positions on this
issue. They were not energetic in attempting to protect the
president from the consequences of his personal commitment to
freeing the hostages."
    The report saved some of its most scathing language for
Regan, a gruff former Wall Street executive and close personal
friend of Reagan whose autocratic rule in the White House
angered some top Reagan officials and, perhaps more
importantly, Reagan's wife Nancy.
    "More than almost any chief of staff of recent memory, he
asserted personal control over the White House staff and sought
to extend this control to the national security adviser," said
the report.
    Washington analysts said Regan's departure now appeared to
be only a matter of timing. Many expected the president to
announce it when he addresses the nation on the Tower
Commission's findings next week.
    With Regan's departure apparently imminent and Poindexter
and other key figures in the scandal already out of office, the
report's tough criticism of Shultz and Weinberger could turn
the spotlight on their future.
    Senate Republican leader Robert Dole, a key Reagan ally,
told reporters the report disclosed "colossal blunders" and said
people who had not served the president well should step aside,
but he did not specify who should go.
    "It would seem to me that if you don't protect the
president, you don't serve the president well, then you should
move on," the Kansas Republican, a likely presidential candidate
next year, said.
    One Republican strategist said he believed Regan would not
be the only White House official to leave in the near future.

Dow Chemical Co's <DOW> Merrell Dow
Pharmaceuticals Inc unit said a jury found that Bendectin did
not cause the birth defects of a seven-year old boy whose
mother took the drug during pregnancy.
    The anti-nausea drug has been used to treat morning 
sickness and was discontinued in 1983 amid allegations that the
drug caused birth defects.
    Merrell said that to date there have been 12 other trials
involving the drug, 10 in the U.S. and two in West Germany.
    It said verdicts or judgements in favor of the company were
obtained in eight of the trials, one of which included about
1,150 plaintiffs.
    In two trials, Merrell said, verdicts were in favor of the
plaintiffs. In one, it said, the trial judge overruled the
jury's verdict and issued a judgement in favor of the company
and a three judge panel of the Court of Appeals overturned the
trial judge's ruling. Merrell is now awaiting a rehearing of
this case by the full Court of Appeals.
    Of the remaining two trials, one ended in a mistrial and in
the other the jury was unable to reach a verdict.
    At one point about 1700 lawsuits had been filed alleging
the drug caused birth defects, said a company spokesman. He
said about 300 lawsuits are pending.
    Bendectin was first introduced in the early 1950s, and the
Merrell spokesman said a valid application to make and market
the drug is with the Food and Drug Administration should the
company decide it wants to reintroduce it.

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission
(NRC) proposed to ease evacuation standards for nuclear plants,
which could lead the way to the licensing of controversial
plants in New York and New Hampshire.
    The NRC voted 4-1 to offer the rule for 60 days of public
comment before it reconsidered it and set emergency evacuation
standards of its own.
    Local authorites at the plants at Shoreham, Long Island,
N.Y., and Seabrook, N.H., had refused to take part in
evacuation planning, as required under existing NRC rules.
    They had claimed the region was too populated for any safe
evacuation plan, holding up the NRC's authority to issue full
power licenses of the two multi-billon dollar plants.
    A group of prominent politicians, led by New York Governor
Mario Cuomo, charged at a public meeting on the proposed plan
on Tuesday that NRC members were more interested in protecting
the utilties'investments than protecting public safety.
    An NRC spokesman said after the meeting that the agency had
not yet scheduled a meeting to vote on the proposed plan.
    In a statement today announcing its vote, the commission
said the proposed rule change would enable the NRC to act in
cases where local authorities refused to take part in emergency

The sharp decline in soybean crush ratios
seen in the last few weeks, accelerating in recent days, has
pushed margins below the cost of production at most soybean
processing plants and prompted many to cut output of soybean
meal and oil.
    The weekly U.S. soybean crush rate was reported by the
National Soybean Processors Association this afternoon at 21.78
mln bushels, down from the 22 mln bushel plus rate seen over
the past two months when crush margins surged to the best
levels seen in over a year.
    Active soymeal export loadings at the Gulf had pushed
soybean futures and premiums higher, prompting a pick-up in the
weekly crush number.
    However, much of that export demand seems to have been met,
with most foreign meal users now waiting for the expected surge
in shipments of new crop South American soymeal over the next
few months.
    U.S. processors are now finding domestic livestock feed
demand is very light for this time of year due to the milder
than normal winter, so they steadily dropped offering prices in
an attempt to find buying interest, soyproduct dealers said.
    Soybean meal futures have also steadily declined in recent
weeks, setting a new contract low of 139.70 dlrs per ton in the
nearby March contract today.
    "Many speculators down here bought March soymeal and sold
May, looking for no deliveries (on first notice day tomorrow,
which would cause March to gain on deferreds)," one CBT crush
trader said.
    "But they've been bailing out this week because the March
has been acting like there will be a lot delivered, if not
tomorrow, then later in the month," he added.
    As a result of the weakness in soymeal, the March crush
ratio (The value of soyproducts less the cost of the soybeans)
fell from the mid 30s earlier this month to 22.6 cents per
bushel today, dropping over five cents in just the last two
days.
    The May crush ended today just over 17 cents, so no
processors will want to lock in a ratio at that unprofitable
level, the trader said. Hopefully, they will now start to cut
back production to get supplies in line with demand, he added.
    With futures down, processors are finding they must bid
premiums for cash soybeans, further reducing crush margins.
    A central Illinois processor is only making about 30 cents
for every bushel of soybeans crushed at current prices, down
sharply from levels just seen just a few weeks ago and below
the average cost of production, cash dealers said.
    Most soybean processing plants are still in operation, with
little talk of taking temporary down-time, so far. But
processors will start halting production in the next few weeks
it they continue to face unprofitable margins, they added.

Latest Federal Reserve data suggest that
the central bank voted to maintain the existing degree of
pressure on banking reserves at its regular policy-making
meeting two weeks ago, money market economists said.
    "The numbers were a little disappointing, but I think we
can take Mr Volcker at his word when he said that nothing had
changed," said Bob Bannon of Security Pacific National Bank.
    Fed Chairman Paul Volcker told a Congressional committee
last Thursday that the Fed's policy "has been unchanged up to
today."
    Although Volcker's statement last Thursday allayed most
fears that the Fed had marginally tightened its grip on
reserves to help an ailing dollar, many economists still wanted
confirmation of a steady policy in today's data, which covered
the two-week bank statement period ended yesterday.
    This need for additional reassurance was made all the more
acute by the Fed's decision yesterday to drain reserves from
the banking system by arranging overnight matched sale-purchase
agreements for the first time since April of last year,
economists added.
    Today's data showed that the draining action was for a
fairly large 3.9 billion dlrs, economists said.
    "The one thing that caught my eye were the relatively
sizeable matched sales on Wednesday," said Dana Johnson of
First National Bank of Chicago. "But there was a clearly
justified need for them. There was nothing ominous."
    "The Fed couldn't have waited until the start of the new
statement period today. If it had, it would have missed its
(reserve) projections," added Security Pacific's Bannon.
    A Fed spokesman told reporters that there were no large
single-day net miss in reserve projections in the latest week.
    Economists similarly shrugged off slightly higher-than-
expected adjusted bank borrowings from the Fed's discount
window, which averaged 310 mln dlrs a day in the latest week,
compared with many economists' forecasts of about 200 mln.
    For the two-week bank statement period as a whole, the
daily borrowing average more than doubled to 381 mln dlrs from
160 in the prior period.
    "There were wire problems at two large banks on Tuesday and
Wednesday, so I am not too bothered about the borrowings," said
Scott Winningham of J.S. Winningham and Co. The Wednesday
average rose to 946 mln dlrs from 148 mln a week earlier.
    Lending further support to the stable policy view was a
relatively steady federal funds rate of about six pct in the
latest week and persistently high levels of excess reserves in
the banking system, economists said.
    "For the time being, the Fed is following a neutral path,
with fed funds at about six to 6-1/8 pct," said Darwin Beck of
First Boston Corp. "I expect it to continue in that vein."
    "Excess reserves fell but they are still over a billion
dlrs," added First Chicago's Johnson. Banks' excess reserves
averaged 1.03 billion dlrs a day in the latest statement
period, down from 1.50 billion in the previous one.
    After the Fed declined to assign a 1987 target growth range
to the wayward M-1 money supply measure last week, little
attention was paid to a steeper-than-anticipated 2.1 billion
dlr jump in the week ended February 16.
    Looking ahead, economists said the Fed will have to tread a
fine line between the dollar's progress in the international
currency markets and the development of the domestic economy.
    "The market has perhaps exaggerated the dollar's effect on
Fed policy," said First Chicago's Johnson. "Of course, it will
take the dollar into account in future policy decisions but if
the economy is weak, it won't pull back from easing."

Japan is expected to cut the base lending
rate for state financial institutions to 5.5 pct from 6.2 as
part of the recent pact by major industrial nations in Paris,
Finance Ministry sources said.
    They said the cut is based on a revision of the Trust Fund
Bureau Law, which should be approved by parliament on March 3,
abolishing the 6.05 pct minimum interest rate on deposits with
the bureau.
    The bureau channels funds to government financial
institutions for public works and other official uses, they
said.
    The base lending rate for state bodies such as the Japan
Development Bank, People's Finance Corp and the finance
corporations of local public enterprises usually moves in
tandem with long-term prime rates, the sources said.
    However, it was impossible for them to follow the last cut,
to 5.8 pct from 6.2 pct on January 28, because the Trust Fund
Bureau rate was legally set at 6.05 pct.
    The ministry will abolish the minimum rate and introduce a
market-related one to resolve the problem and stimulate the
domestic economy, they said.
    On Tuesday, the ministry allowed long-term bankers to cut
their prime to a record low of 5.5 pct, effective February 28.
The move suggested it had reached agreement with depositors
using the bureau, the postal savings system of the Posts and
Telecommunications Ministry and the Japan welfare annuity of
the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the sources said.
    These ministries are trying to determine which market rates
should be considered when setting the bureau's deposit rate,
the ministry sources said.
    Coupon rates on new 10-year government bonds, minus 0.1
percentage points, is the likeliest choice, they added.

The U.S. Economy continued to expand in
February but at a slower pace than in January, which saw a
spurt of activity, the National Association of Purchasing
Management (NAPM) said in a report.
    The Association's composite survey index dropped to 51.9
pct in February from 55.8 pct in January, the NAPM said. It was
the seventh consecutive month in which this leading indicator
was over 50 pct.
    A reading above 50 pct generally indicates that the economy
is in an expanding phase. One below 50 pct implies a declining
economy.
    The  NAPM report, based on a survey of purchasing managers
at 250 U.S. Industrial companies, also found that the growth
rate in new orders and production slowed in February.
    But production remained vigorous, with more than three
times as many members reporting it better rather than worse.
    Vendor deliveries improved slightly last month, but members
reported that steel supplies were tight as USX Corp gradually
resumed production.
    The same number of members reported inventories were higher
as reported them lower. The NAPM said that had not happened
since August 1984.
    For a sixth straight month, more purchasers reported paying
higher rather than lower prices, this time by a ratio of nine
to one.
    Robert Bretz, chairman of the NAPM's business survey
committee, said: "The economy continued to expand in February,
but at a more subdued rate than in January. The slowing of new
orders should not be significant enough to dampen prospects for
a respectable first quarter."
    The composite index is a seasonally adjusted figure, based
on five components of the NAPM business survey - new orders,
production, vendor deliveries, inventories and employment.

After an onslaught of new paper, fewer
mark eurobonds issues are expected this week, bankers said.
    Most managers said they were planning a low issue volume
for the Bundesbank's two-week bond calendar beginning today.
    "We want to have a week's pause," one manager said.
    Last week borrowings totalled 1.775 billion marks,
including a 300 mln mark private placement for Deutsche Bank.
Issues for all of February rose to nearly five billion marks,
from 3.6 billion in January.
    The heavy volume also meant most borrowers except the very
best addresses were having to accept higher coupons.
    "I think the D-mark market is still good, but only if you
can give a good coupon," another manager said.
    But even some government borrowers were not getting the
best reception for bonds which would have been taken up more
readily under other conditions.
    Of the three mark eurobonds launched on Tuesday alone,
bonds for Den Danske Bank and Iceland were trading outside fees
on Friday, although prices had recovered from initial lows.
    Den Danske's 5-3/4 1992 bond was quoted at midday on Friday
at 97.35/65 compared with its par price, and Iceland's 6-1/2
pct 1997 bond traded at 97.25/75 against a 100-1/4 issue price.
    A 300 mln mark 6-1/8 pct 1997 issue for Nippon Telegraph
and Telephone was also depressed, but traded Friday within fees
at 98.15, 98.50 from its par price.
    Some shorter maturities did better. In contrast to the
10-year NTT and Iceland issues, a five-year six pct bond for
Hoogovens, traded at 98.40/75 from its 99-1/2 price, thanks
mainly to its shorter maturity, dealers said.
    The large amount of paper brought to the market in the last
two months has also led many syndicate managers to complain
about the Bundesbank's present fixed calendar system, which
they say is too inflexible.
    Currently all mark denominated eurobonds have to be
registered with the Bundesbank in the week preceding the
two-week issue period. A bank may decline to issue a bond on
the requested day in the calendar, but then has to wait for the
next calendar period to schedule the bond again.
    Some managers said they would prefer to abolish the system.
    The Bundesbank shortened the reporting period to two weeks
from four weeks last July. But few expect the calendar to be
completely abolished. "I don't think the Bundesbank would give
that up," one banking analyst said.
    "I wouldn't have anything against getting rid of the system,"
the analyst said, adding banks were capable of regulating the
volume of new issues themselves.
    The Bundesbank plays a passive role in setting the calendar
without trying to regulate the issues, but it needs the
registration to gauge the volume of mark bonds going through
the euromarket, he said.
    For this reason, few managers here foresee the Bundesbank
sacrificing its present calendar system.
    Bond activity in West German bond trading and syndication
departments is also expected to be quieter than normal owing to
the carnival holiday.
    Carnival will close banks in Duesseldorf all day on Monday.
In Frankfurt, banks will close on Tuesday in the afternoon.

<Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp>
(NTT) expects its profits to fall to 328 billion yen in the
year ending March 31, 1988 from a projected 348 billion this
year, the company said.
    Total sales for the same period are expected to rise to
5,506 billion yen from a projected 5,328 billion this year, NTT

    NTT said it plans to make capital investments of 1,770
billion yen in 1987/88, including 109 billion for research and
development, as against a total of 1,600 billion this year.
    An NTT spokesman said increased competition from new

major factors behind the projected decrease in profits.

Japanese securities houses will issue new
corporate bonds more quickly, accept issue requests throughout
the month instead of at month-end and introduce a competitive
underwriting method from April 1, to bring Japanese firms back
to the Tokyo bond market, securities managers said.
    Domestic issues have slowed to a trickle as more and more
companies turn to more flexible overseas markets for cash, but
the proposed moves are expected to pave the way for a review of
public bond issues, they said.
    "Relaxation of issue rules would be better applied not only
to straight corporate bonds, but also convertible bonds and
warrant bonds, to call back issuers effectively from overseas
markets," a Nikko Securities house bond manager said.
    Securities houses will launch an issue about 10 days after
a corporate declaration of intent instead of 25 days as now,
the securities managers said.
    Underwriters are expected to abolish the lump-sum issuance
system, in which all corporate bonds are issued at month-end,
and accept issue requests during the month, they said.
    Securities houses also plan to introduce free competition
among underwriters when negotiating with issuers over terms in
order to better reflect the market, securities managers said.
    Market participants expect the new issue methods to be
applied beginning in April, with the projected issue by <Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone Corp>.
    The so-called proposal method abolishes the practice of
taking lead-managership and enables more market-oriented
decisions on terms, securities sources said.
    The four major Japanese securities houses now take turns
underwriting corporate bonds.
    Setting issue terms using financial criteria prepared by
securities houses and in reference to coupon rates on latest
public bonds is now almost automatic, they said.
    The new moves are based on wide-ranging proposals made in
late December by advisers to Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa.
They were aimed at revitalising the domestic corporate bond
market, securities house managers said.
    The finance ministry, commissioned banks and securities
houses agreed in January to lower the eligibility ceiling for
companies wanting to issue non-collateral straight and
convertible bonds from March 1, securities managers said.
    The cut will more than double the number of corporations
able to make non-collateral issues from around 70 for straight
bonds and 180 for convertibles now, securities managers said.
    The Bond Market Committee of the Securities Exchange
Council also recommended introduction of a shelf registration
system, more use of corporate ratings systems and
simplification of disclosure rules to help speed up the issuing
process, securities sources said.
    It also called for a major review of the commissioned bank
system, which increases the cost of issuing domestic bonds, and
for deregulation of private placements, they said.
    Some of these proposals are likely to take some time to put
into effect, the sources said. A shelf registration system
would need a revision of Japanese commercial law, expected in
1988, the sources said.

    The interest rate ceiling of MMCs with maturities of
between one year and two years will be set at 0.5 percentage
point below the prevailing certificate of deposit rate, the

Japanese consumers hesitated about buying
the controversial digital audio tape player (DAT) as it went on
sale in Tokyo today, but said the DAT player's near-perfect
sound will make it a success once it becomes cheaper.
    "The sound is great, but I'll wait until more machines hit
the market and prices fall to about 100,000 yen before buying
one," said Terumi Fujitsuka, 35, a steel firm employee.
    Aiwa, Sharp and Matsushita displayed their DAT players
today although delivery will take about two weeks, retailers
said. Aiwa's machine, the cheapest, is listed at 188,000 yen.
    Machines by Sony, Hitachi, Toshiba and others will appear
as early as the end of March, industry sources said.
    DAT players can play back and record with fidelity superior
to even a compact disc. They use a cassette half the size of
the standard audio cassette and unlike conventional analogue
machines, they can make copies an infinite number of times with
almost no loss of sound quality.
    This aroused fears in the music industry of widespread tape
piracy and loss of royalties. In negotiations that delayed the
DAT player's debut, the industry demanded anti-piracy circuitry
be built into the machines.
    Machines sold in Japan are fitted with a computer chip to
prevent copying through a digital signal. But copies can still
be made if the signal is routed through a regular amplifier.
"Nobody can tell the difference," one salesman said.
    DAT players have been kept off Western markets and some
countries are considering banning them or imposing heavy duties
unless tougher anti-piracy circuitry is added. But Japanese
hardware makers, hard pressed for profits in the era of the
high yen and growing competition, are eager to carve out a
profitable niche.
    Prices of DAT players will probably fall quickly, possibly
to around 70,000 yen by next year as other makers put their
products on the market, industry analysts said.
    They said by 1990, sales could reach six mln units per
year.
    Philips of the Netherlands has said it will launch its DAT
player on the world market later this year.

    The report, based on questions asked of purchasing managers
at 250 U.S. industrial companies, also found that the growth
rate in new orders and production slowed in February.
    However, production remained vigorous as more than three
times as many members reported it better rather than worse.
    Vendor deliveries improved slightly last month, but members
reported that steel supplies were tight as U.S. Steel <X>
gradually resumed production.
    An equal number of members reported inventories were higher
and lower. The NAPM said that had not happened since August
1984.
    For a sixth month, more purchasers reported paying higher
rather than lower prices, this time by a ratio of nine to one.
    Robert Bretz, chairman of the NAPM's business survey
committee and director of materials management at Pitney Bowes
Inc <PBI> said "the economy continued to expand in February,
but at a more subdued rate than in January. The slowing of new
orders should not be significant enough to dampen prospects for
a respectable first quarter."
    The composite index is a seasonally adjusted figure, based
on five components of the NAPM business survey - new orders,
production, vendor deliveries, inventories and employment.

American Express Co, rumored to be
considering a spinoff of part of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc,
said it is studying a range of options for its brokerage unit
that could improve Shearon's access to capital and help it meet
broadening international competition.
    In a joint statement, American Express and Shearson said
the actions under consideration are an integral part of
American Express' worldwide financial services strategy and
that the two companies have been having both internal and
external discussions on the matters.
    American Express said no decision has been reached on the
strategic options and that it and Shearson could ultimately
decide to follow growth plans already in place.
    Last week, rumors circulated on Wall Street that the
financial services giant was considering a spinoff of part of
Shearson and there was speculation it may be considering
selling a stake to a Japanese firm. Analysts said the
speculation also focused on American Express selling 20 pct of
the profitable brokerage firm to the public.
    There was some speculation that American Express had also
considered a total spinoff of Shearson, but the plan was
considered highly unlikely, analysts said.
     American Express said in the statement on Sunday that it
will not comment on rumors and speculation and a spokesman
would not go beyond the statement. The company also remained
silent last Thursday and Friday, as rumors drove American
Express stock up a total of 5-1/2 dlrs in two days to bring it
to a Friday close at 74.
     It said it issued the statement on Sunday because a
similar statement was being circulated to employees.
    Analysts have been divided on whether it makes sense for
American Express to give up a stake in the wholly-owned
brokerage, which improved its after-tax earnings by about 50
pct in the last year.
    Some analysts said American Express may consider spinning
off part of Shearson because it is concerned that its stock
price does not fully reflect the value of the brokerage firm.
     Shearson contributed 316 mln dlrs of American Express'
1.25 billion dlr net in 1986.
    American Express' ambitious plans for international growth
may be also enhanced by the added cash that spinning out part
of Shearson would bring. Analysts speculated that all of
Shearson would have a market value of about 3.5 billion dlrs.
    To some however, the need for added capital is puzzling.
"(American) Express is in a position where they can raise
capital if they need to," said Larry Eckenfelder of
Prudential-Bache Securities.
    Analysts said rumors were fed by the reorganization of
Shearson management Wednesday. Chief operating officer Jeffrey
Lane got the added, previously vacant, post of president.
     The reorganization also created four new positions for
chairmen of Shearson's operating divisions, a move analysts
speculated would allow Shearson to be a stand alone company.
     Analysts, contacted on Sunday said the statement does
little to clarify last week's market speculation. It does
confirm, however, that the financial services firm, which
unsuccessfully attempted to expand Shearson with a major
acquisition last year, is looking beyond its own walls for
growth and positioning in the global market competition.
    Late last year, Shearson's takeover offer to the E.F.
Hutton Group Inc was rejected by Hutton, and analysts said
there had been speculation that Shearson also was rebuffed when
it approached another major Wall Street brokerage.

Apple Computer Inc today will
announce the addition of two new machines to its profitable
Macintosh line of personal computers, both aimed at the
business market.
    The Macintosh was first introduced in January 1984 and has
been upgraded several times since then. Both of the new
machines, the Macintosh SE and the Macintosh II, will be faster
and more versatile, but considerably more expensive than
earlier models.
    The Mac SE (SE stands for "system expansion"), which Apple
says will operate 15-20 pct faster than its current Mac Plus,
goes on sale today. It carries a suggested retail price ranging
from 2,899 to 3,699 dlrs depending on its features.
    The Mac II, designed to run about four times faster than
the Mac Plus, is to be ready for shipping in May and priced
between 4,798 and 6,998 dlrs.
    Mac Plus, which went on the market one year ago, sells for
about 2,200 dlrs.
    Both new computers are to be unveiled at the AppleWorld
Conference in Los Angeles.
    Company officials expressed high hopes for both computers
at a press briefing on Friday, especially the high-performance
Mac II which is designed to give Apple an entree to the
expanding market for science and engineering workstations.
    John Sculley, Apple chairman and chief executive officer,
declined to estimate anticipated sales, but he said the Mac SE
should contribute significantly to Apple's bottom line this
year. He said it would appeal to the mainstream of PC users.
    "I believe the Mac SE will be the product of choice for
most people," he said. "My sense is that it will be a real
power product for revenue."
    Bruce Lupatkin, senior technology analyst with Hambrecht &
Quist in San Francisco, said he had not seen the new computers
but expected the new products to do well.
    "Apple has recognized the need for a convergence of
computer functions into one general all-purpose workstation,"

LL and E Royalty Trust said Louisiana
Land and Exploration Co <LLX>, the working interest owner for
its oil and natural gas properties, is entitled to start
placing all or part of the revenues that would otherwise accrue
to the trust.
    LL and E said Louisiana Land has not yet escrowed any
amounts and will monitor the siutuation to determine the
necessity of doing so.  The trust said "If the working interest
owner does begin to escrow funds, the effect on the royalties
paid to the trust would be significant."  Royalties from the
properties are the trust's only source of income.
    The trust said independent petroleum engineers' preliminary
annual estimates of future net revenues and the discounted
present value of future net revenues from proved oil and
natural gas reserves attributable to properties in which the
trust has an interest are off 64 pct and 56 pct respectively
from those estimated in 1986 due to the drop in oil and natural
gas prices.
    It said, however, that oil and natural gas reserves have
actually increased in physical amount.  The cost estimates
reflect prices and costs only through September 30.
    The trust said using the September figures, the engineers
determined estimated future net revenues to the trust from
total proved reserves of about 57 mln dlrs.  Usingprices
received in January 1987, however, it said the estimate would
have been about 87 mln dlrs.  LL and E noted that there has
been some weakening in prices since January.
    The trust said the most significant portion of the drop in
estimated future revenues cale from the Jay Field in Alabama
and Florida, a fall to seven mln dlrs from 92 mln dlrs in 1986,
as prices recieved from Jay in September were near production
costs after expenses of nitrogen injection.

New Jersey-based overnight messenger
Purolator Courier Corp said it has agreed to be acquired for
about 265 mln dlrs by a company formed by E.F. Hutton LBO Inc
and certain managers of Purolator's U.S. courier business.
    Analysts have said that Purolator has been for sale for
some time. Purolator announced earlier it was mulling a
takeover bid, but analysts wrongly predicted the offer was from
another courier company.
    Hutton LBO, a wholly owned subsidiary of E.F. Hutton Group
Inc, will be majority owner of the company.
    Hutton said the acquiring company, PC Acquisition Inc, is
paying 35 dlrs cash per share for 83 pct of Purolator's stock
in a tender offer to begin Thursday. The rest of the shares
will be purchased for securities and warrants to buy stock in a
subsidiary of PC Acquisition, containing Purolator's U.S.
courier operations.
    If all the shares of Purolator are tendered, shareholders
would receive for each share 29 dlrs cash, six dlrs in
debentures, and a warrant to buy shares in a subsidiary of PC
Acquisition containing the U.S. courier operations.
    Hutton said in the merger shareholders would get 46 mln
dlrs aggregate amount of guaranteed debentures due 2002 of PC
Acquisition and warrants to buy 15 pct of the common stock of
the PC courier subsidiary. Hutton said the company has valued
the warrants at two to three dlrs per share.
    Purolator's stock price closed at 35.125 dlrs on Friday.
While some analysts estimated the company was worth in the mid
30s, at least one said it would be worth 38 to 42 dlrs.
    This follows sales of two other Purolator units. It agreed
recently to sell its Canadian Courier unit to Onex Capital for
170 mln dlrs, and previously sold its auto filters business.
    Purolator retains its Stant division, which makes closure
caps for radiators and gas tanks. A Hutton spokesman said the
firm is reviewing its options on Stant.
    Purolator's courier business has been lagging that of its
U.S. rivals because of the high price it paid in the past
several years to add air delivery to its ground fleet.
    E.F. Hutton will provide 279 mln dlrs of its funds to
complete the transaction. This so-called "bridge" financing
will be replaced later with long-term debt most likely in the
form of bank loans, Hutton said. Hutton LBO is committed to
keeping the courier business, its president Warren Idsal said.
    "Purolator lost 120 mln dlrs over the last two years
largely due to U.S. courier operations, which we believe the
management is turning around. We belive it will be a very
serious competitor in the future," said Idsal.
    William Taggart, chief executive officer of U.S. Courier
division, will be chief executive officer of the new company.
    The tender offer will be conditioned on a minimum of two
thirds of the common stock being tendered and not withdrawn to
the expiration of the offer as well as certain other conditions.
    The offer will begin Thursday, subject to clearances from
the staff of the Interstate Commerce Commission and will expire
20 business days after commencement unless extended.

The U.S. asset-backed debt securities
market, which grew explosively last year, is broadening and
investment bankers say 1987 could see a variety of issuers.
    "It is interesting to note that the first two asset-backed
deals of the year were done by commercial banks," said Anthony
Dub, who heads First Boston Corp's asset-backed group.
    BankAmerica Corp's <BAC> Bank of America unit last week
issued 400 mln dlrs of securities backed by credit card
receivables via sole manager First Boston. Dub said the
offering sold out quickly, mostly to institutional investors.
    The Bank of America offering followed a January 16 issue of
200 mln dlrs of similar debt by RepublicBank Corp's <RPT>
RepublicBank Delaware unit. Goldman, Sachs and Co ran the books
on that deal, with First Boston acting as co-manager.
    However, Dub said the Bank of America securities were more
closely related to the so-called "cars deals" that raced to
market last year than were the RepublicBank securities.
    "The RepublicBank issue was secured by credit card
receivables. In contrast, the Bank of America deal was the
first public offering of credit card receivables because we
used a grantor trust vehicle," he said.
    In a grantor trust, investors buy asset-backed certificates
that represent a specified percentage of an undivided interest
in the trust, analysts explained.
    The Bank of America certificates were issued by California
Credit Card Trust A, which the bank established for that single
purpose, investment bankers pointed out.
    The debt has an average life of 1.79 years and matures in
1992. First Boston gave the issue a 6.90 pct coupon and priced
it at 99.8125 to yield 6.95 pct, or 65 basis points over
comparable Treasury securities. Non-callable for life, the deal
was rated AAA by both Moody's and Standard and Poor's.
    Underwriters away from the syndicate said they believed the
Bank of America deal was priced too aggressively. "AAA-rated
auto paper was trading about 75 basis points over Treasuries
when First Boston priced the deal," one said.
    However, Dub said the offering sold out quickly anyway.
    The First Boston executive attributed this to the deal's
top-flight rating by both agencies, unlike many of last year's
cars deals, which were rated by S and P alone.
    "Investors receive interest only payments for the first 18
months and then interest and principal payments for the
remaining five to seven months," Dub detailed.
    Investment bankers pointed out that because the Bank of
America deal did not pay principal for a year and a half, the
issue had a longer average life than some of the cars deals
that were brought to market late last year.
    The collateral for the trust includes a pool of VISA credit
card receivables, backed by a letter of credit. Bank of America
has about four billion dlrs of credit card receivables, making
it one of the biggest in the U.S., analysts said.
    Last week's deal was Bank of America's second foray into
the young asset-backed securities market, analysts noted.
    In mid-December 1986 Bank of America sold, via California
Cars Grantor Trust 1986-A, 514 mln dlrs of certificates backed
by automobile receivables through Salomon Brothers Inc.
    Upcoming asset-backed issues include 200 mln dlrs of notes
backed by the car leases of Volvo 1986 Lease Finance Corp, a
unit of Volvo Finance North America Inc, via First Boston, and
450 mln dlrs of notes secured by sales contracts of Mack Trucks
Receivables Corp, a unit of Mack Trucks Inc <MACK>, via
Shearson Lehmand Brothers Inc.
    The asset backed market, which began in March 1985, totals
an estimated 11.9 billion dlrs.

and the hiring of temporary employees to replace staffer
employees.
    The guild represents newswriters, editors, desk assistants,

Investor Sumner Redstone, who leads
one of the two groups vying for control of Viacom International
Inc, offered to sweeten his bid for the company by 1.50 dlrs a
share cash and 1.50 dlrs in securities.
    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Redstone, who controls Dedham, Mass.,-based National Amusements
Inc, a theater chain operator, offered to raise the cash
portion of its Viacom offer to 42 dlrs a share from 40.50 dlrs.
    Redstone also raised the face value of the preferred stock
he is offering to 7.50 dlrs from six dlrs.
    The Redstone offer, which is being made through Arsenal
Holdings Inc, a National Amusements subsidiary set up for that
purpose, which also give Viacom shareholders one-fifth of a
share of Arsenal common stock after the takeover.
    Viacom said earlier today it received revised takeover bids
from Redstone and MCV Holdings Inc, a group led by Viacom
management which is competing with Redstone for control of the
company and already has a formal merger agreement with Viacom.
    The company did not disclose the details of the revised
offers, but said a special committee of its board would review
them later today.
    The Redstone group, which has a 19.5 pct stake in Viacom,
and the management group, which has a 5.4 pct stake, have both
agreed not to buy more shares of the company until a merger is
completed, unless the purchases are part of a tender offer for
at least half of the outstanding stock.
    The two rivals also signed confidentiality agreements,
which give them access to Viacom's financial records provided
they keep the information secret.
    In his SEC filing, Redstone, who estimated his cost of
completing the takeover at 2.95 billion dlrs, said Bank of
America is confident it can raise 2.275 billion dlrs.
    Besides the financing it would raise through a bank
syndicate, Bank of America has also agreed to provide a
separate 25 mln dlr for the limited purpose of partial
financing and has committed to provide another 592 mln dlrs,
Redstone said.
    Merrill Lynch, Pierce Fenner and Smith Inc has increased
its underwriting commitment to 175 mln dlrs of subordinated
financing debt for the Viacom takeover, from the 150 mln dlrs
it agreed to underwrite earlier, Redstone said.
    Redstone said his group would contribute more than 475 mln
dlrs in equity toward the takeover.
    The Redstone equity contribution to the takeover would
consist of all of his group's 6,881,800 Viacom common shares
and at least 118 mln dlrs cash, he said.
    The new offer, the second sweetened deal Redstone has
proposed in his month-long bidding war with management, also
contains newly drawn up proposed merger documents, he said.
    Last week, the management group submitted what it called
its last offer for the company, valued at 3.1 mln dlrs and
consisting of 38.50 dlrs a share cash, preferred stock valued
at eight dlrs a share and equity in the new company. Redstone's
previous offer had been valued at 3.2 billion dlrs.

Directors of the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange will meet Wednesday to consider a membership petition
asking the exchange to tighten rules covering trading
activities in the widely-popular Standard and Poor's 500 Stock
Index futures pit, an exchange executive said.
    The petition calls for elimination of dual trading, a legal
practice where traders execute customer orders as well as trade
for their own account.
    But exchange officials noted this practice also provides an
opportunity for a trader to engage in what is called
"front-running", where traders enter orders for their own account
before executing orders for their customers.
    Leo Melamed, CME special counsel, said directors will rule
on the petition on Wednesday, but added that a special S and P
Advisory Committee has been studying S and P 500 futures
trading conditions for the last six months and is expected to
submit a complete list of recommendations within 30 days.
    In addition to a recommendation on dual trading, Melamed
said the special committee will also make suggestions about a
possible automatic order entry and execution system for S and P
500 futures and futures-options and rule changes that would
alleviate congested conditions in the trading pit.
    Melamed said directors are likely to approve the
recommendations of the special committee because "most actions
of the board are in line with committee recommendations."
    CME senior vice president Gerald Beyer said if the board
accepts the member's petition this week, a rule change will be
submitted to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission for
approval.
    If the board does nothing, or rejects the petition request,
a rule change must then be submitted to the exchange membership
for a vote within 15 days, Beyer said.
    Melamed also added that if the petition must be ruled on
before the recommendations from the special committee are made
"it will confuse the issue."
    Not all traders agree on the need to eliminiate or restrict
dual trading.
    Although Jonathan Wolff, senior vice president at Donaldson
Lufkin and Jenrette, noted dual trading is evident on most
exchanges.
    "It's a question of the integrity of the person you do
business with," Wolff said.
    Futures traders who act as brokers, however, maintain that
trading for their own accounts is necessary in order to make up
for errors they inevitably make when filling customer orders in
chaotic futures trading pits.
    "To have an absolute ban on dual trading makes it difficult
for a broker to function because of his errors," said John
Michael, vice president at First Options of Chicago.
    "What it comes down to is the ethics of the people involved,"
he said.
    Furthermore, the competitive nature of futures brokerage
makes front-running risky to a broker's livelihood, he said.
    "If I ever discovered a broker doing it (front-running), or
even suspected him of doing it, I would cut him off," Michael
said.
    An average broker in the Treasury bond futures pit, for
instance, will fill orders for 5,000 to 10,000 contracts a day
at 1.25 dlrs per contract, floor sources said.  Even figuring
what is considered a typical 25 pct loss for errors such
brokerage can be lucrative.
    Front-running by brokers not only runs the market risk of
an adverse price move, but also the risk of losing the
brokerage business, Michael said.

WEDGE Group Inc, a Houston investment

    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
WEDGE, which is owned by Issam Fares, a Lebanese citizen living
in Switzerland, also said it discussed the possibility of
joining with others in its own bid to seek control of AMI.
    WEDGE stressed that it has no current plans to seek control
of AMI, but refused to rule out a takeover try in the future.
    WEDGE said it has had discussions with AMI management,
Pesch, the closely held health care and investment concern
controlled by Chicago physician LeRoy Pesch, and other AMI
shareholders.
    It did not specify in its SEC filing which issues --
selling its AMI stake or joining with others in a takeover try
-- were discussed with which group. But it said the talks did
not produce any agreements or understandings.
    WEDGE said it believes that "some form of restructuring of
AMI and its business would be highly desirable and appropriate
at this time."
    WEDGE, which holds 4.8 mln shares of AMI common stock, said
it plans to hold further talks with company management, Pesch
and other shareholders.
    Pesch last week sweetened his bid for the company to 22
dlrs a share in cash and securties, or 1.91 billion dlrs based
on AMI's total outstanding, from an all-cash 20 dlr a share
bid, which the company rejected.

for the Canadian coast guard, Transport Minister John Crosbie

    In a Vancouver address, Crosbie said Versatile Pacific
Shipyards Inc was the low bidder to build the Arctic Class 8
icebreaker, but the company must meet certain financial and
engineering conditions before the contract is awarded.
    The government also announced it will provide up to 13 mln
dlrs in loan insurance to help Versatile prepare for the
construction of the vessel.
said before the contract can be awarded Versatile "will be
required to offer assurances that the shipyard is technically
and financially capable of performing the work."
    Crosibie said Versatile's bid was 100 mln dlrs lower than
competing bidders and will generate 1,000 person years of
direct employment.
    Work on the vessel, which Crosbie said would be the most
powerful icebreaker in the world, would begin next year and
completed in 1992.
    The government announced plans to build the icebreaker last
year following the controversial passage of the U.S. Coast
Guard's vessel, the Polar Sea, through the disputed Northwest
Passage. The U.S. government did not seek permission for the
journey, claiming the area was an international water way.

five years as we have had in the past," Ziering said.
    Over the past five years Ziering said the company has had
average compound net income growth of 32 pct annually with a 27
pct per year growth in earnings per share. For 1986 the company
had net income of 6.3 mln dlrs, or 1.07 dlrs per share, vs 3.9
mln dlrs, or 73 cts per share in 1985.
    Diagnostic manufactures medical immunological diagnostic
test kits.
    Ziering said he expects the earnings growth to result from
positive effect of the weaker dollar on the company's exports
sales as well as accelerated market penetration. Ziering said
he expected the Food and Drug Administration to approve three
more of its drug abuse test kits by the end of the year, which,
depending on approval, should also help earnings growth.
    Ziering said as a result of the new tax laws he expected
the company's taxes to decrease by five pct to 31 pct of net
income in 1987.

Currency fluctuations may reassert their
influence on the bullion market in the near future, bullion
bankers Samuel Montagu and Co Ltd said in a market report.
    But the firm said silver may lag behind gold in any
reactions to movements on foreign exchanges.
    "OPEC's failure to address the recent decline in oil prices
remains a worrying factor however, and on balance it appears
that the market should be approached cautiously," Montagu said.
    The bank said the US economy has shown no noticeable
long-term improvement and that both Latin American debt and the
Iranian arms affair could undermine confidence in the dollar.

The New York Mercantile Exchange set
April one for the debut of a new procedure in the energy
complex that will increase the use of energy futures worldwide.
     On April one, NYMEX will allow oil traders that do not
hold a futures position to initiate, after the exchange closes,
a transaction that can subsequently be hedged in the futures
market, according to an exchange spokeswoman.
    "This will change the way oil is transacted in the real
world," said said Thomas McKiernan, McKiernan and Co chairman.
    Foreign traders will be able to hedge trades against NYMEX
prices before the exchange opens and negotiate prices at a
differential to NYMEX prices, McKiernan explained.
     The expanded program "will serve the industry because the
oil market does not close when NYMEX does," said Frank Capozza,
secretary of Century Resources Inc.
     The rule change, which has already taken effect for
platinum futures on NYMEX, is expected to increase the open
interest and liquidity in U.S. energy futures, according to
traders and analysts.
    Currently, at least one trader in this transaction, called
an exchange for physical or EFP, must hold a futures position
before entering into the transaction.
    Under the new arrangement, neither party has to hold a
futures position before entering into an EFP and one or both
parties can offset their cash transaction with a futures
contract the next day, according to exchange officials.
    When NYMEX announced its proposed rule change in December,
NYMEX President Rosemary McFadden, said, "Expansion of the EFP
provision will add to globalization of the energy markets by
providing for, in effect, 24-hour trading."
    The Commodity Futures Trading Commission approved the rule
change in February, according to a CFTC spokeswoman.

A bidding war for Viacom International
Inc, one of the largest U.S. entertainment companies, pitted a
management group and other investors against National
Amusements Inc, a closely held theater operator.
    Both sides raised their bids over the weekend. A source
close to the management side insisted that timing was on his
side. He said if outside directors approve the management
proposal, a merger plan could be put to a vote of shareholders
with proxy material going out late this week. "It would take 20
days from the day we mail," said the source.
    The source predicted National Amusements, controlled by
investor Sumner Redstone, would need "half a year" to complete
a tender offer because of the regulatory approvals that must
accompany any change in control of Viacom's broadcast licenses
and cable television franchises.
    Redstone was not available for comment.
    Some of Wall Street's arbitrage players said it was a rare
situation that could only be enjoyed - a true bidding war. One
said Redstone could begin a tender offer whenever he wanted and
if enough people were convinced his proposal was superior to
the Viacom management plan, he would have a chance to win.
    The independent directors of Viacom were called into a
meeting today. Word on a decision was expected early tomorrow.
    Viacom shares climbed 2-1/2 to 50-3/8 by midafternoon. One
major Wall Street firm issued a sell recommendation. "We think
we're at the end now, in terms of bidding," said the firm's
arbitrageur, who spoke on condition he not be identified.
    Both Redstone's proposal and the management proposal would
create a restructured company heavily leveraged with debt. The
management plan would result in a balance sheet with about 2.5
billion dlrs in debt and nearly 500 mln dlrs in preferred
stock, convertible into 45 pct of the common stock.
    Redstone's newest proposal offers holders 42 dlrs in cash,
a fraction of a share of exchangeable preferred stock with a
value of 7.50 dlrs, and one-fifth of a share of common stock
stock of Arsenal Holdings, representing 20 pct of the equity
interest in the restructured Viacom. One arbitrageur calculated
the equity in the Redstone plan was worth 2.50 dlrs making the
total package worth 52 dlrs per share.
    Management offered 38.50 dlrs in cash, exchangeable
preferred stock worth 8.50 dlrs and a fractional share of
convertible preferred. The arbitrageur said the equity portion
was worth about 4.00 dlrs for a total of 51 dlrs.
    Redstone's newest plan raised the amount of interest he
would pay on the cash portion of his offer for every day beyond
April 30 that a merger with Arsenal is not consummated. The
plan calls for intest to be paid at an annual rate of nine pct
during May and 12 pct thereafter. Previously Redstone offered
eight pct interest.
    Other arbitrageurs said both Redstone and the management
group, led by president and chief executive Terrence Elkes,
were offering high prices. "Redstone really wants to own the
company," one said. Another said management seemed to have the
edge on the timing issue.
    Redstone's company owns 19.6 pct ov Viacom's 35 mln shares.
    A Wall Street analyst said it was hard to determine what
the equity in the newly leveraged company would be worth. He
noted as an example that new stock in FMC Corp <FMC>, which
adopted a highly leveraged structure last year, inititally
traded at 12.50 dlrs per share, dipped to nine dlrs, and is now
just over 30 dlrs.
    Last week, Viacom reported fourth quarter earnings fell two
two cts per share from 23 cts. The company said interest costs
from several acquisitions affected results.
    Shares of Warner Communications Inc <WCI> rose 7/8 to
31-1/8. Analysts noted Warner owns warrants to purchase 3.25
mln Viacom shares at 35 dlrs and another 1.25 mln shares at
37.50 dlrs.
    Chris Craft Industries <CCN>, which owns a stake in Warner,
rose 1-1/4 to 22-3/4.
    Viacom was created in 1970 and spun off from CBS Inc <CBS>.
The company has 940,000 cable television subscribers, operates
nine satellite television services and owns television and
radio stations. It is one of the largest distributors of films
and other programs for television.

Marvin Warner and two fellow officers
of the former Home State Savings Bank were convicted on charges
connected with the collapse of Home State.
    Warner, the owner of Home State, was found guilty of six
counts of performing unauthoriazed acts -- investing some Home
State money without authorization from the board of directors
-- and three counts of securities violations in the 1985
collapse. He was acquitted on 76 counts of willful
misapplication.
    Burton Bongard, former Home State president, was convicted
of all 81 counts willful misapplication. David Schiebel, also a
former president, was convicted on three of four counts of
securities violations but was acquitted on 84 charges of
willful misapplication. -- corrects warner's conviction
    The irregularities in which the men were charged led to a
state-imposed moratorium on all state-insured savings and loan
companies in Ohio, which was lifted on an individual basis as
the firms were able to show proof of their solvency.
    Judge Richard Niehaus of Hamilton County Common Pleas Court
ordered Warner jailed in lieu of 3.5 mln dlrs bond. He set a
1.5 mln dlr bond for Bongard and 25,000 dlr bond for Schiebel
pending the appearance of the trio for sentencing March 30.
    Lawrence Kane, special prosecutor, said that Warner and
Bongard could receive a maximum of 15 years in prison. He said
that Schiebel could receive a maximum of 5 to 6 years on his
convictions.
    All three were accused in the draining of 144 mln dlrs of
Home State funds through investments with ESM Government
Securities Inc. of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., which went bankrupt
and triggered the collapse of Home State.
    On March 5, 1985, Ohio Governor Richard Celeste closed all
of the state's privately-insured savings and loan companies and
they remained closed until they could obtain federal deposit
insurance or merge with other companies which had federal

Several analysts said they do not
believe another suitor will top the 265 mln dlr bid for
Purolator Courier Corp by E.F. Hutton LBO Inc and a management
group from Purolator's courier division.
    There had been speculation another offer might be
forthcoming, but analysts mostly believe the 35 dlrs per share
price being paid by Hutton and the managers' PC Acquisition Inc
is fully valued.
    Analysts and some Wall Street sources said they doubted
another bidder would emerge since Purolator had been for sale
for sometime before a deal was struck with Hutton Friday.
    Purolator's stock slipped 3/8 today to close at 34-3/4. It
had been trading slightly higher than the 35 dlr offer on
Friday. At least one analyst Friday speculated the company
might fetch 38 to 42 dlrs per share.
    analysts and wall street sources doubted a competitive
offer would emerge since the company has been for sale for
sometime before the deal with Hutton was struck Friday.
    Hutton had been in talks with Purolator's adviser, Dillon,
Read and Co since late December, a Hutton spokesman said.
    Hutton is offering 35 dlrs cash per share for 83 pct of the
shares. If all shares are tendered, shareholders would receive
29 dlrs cash, six dlrs in debentures, and warrants for stock in
a subsidiary of PC Acquisition containing the Purolator U.S.
courier operation. Hutton values the warrants at two to three
dlrs per share.
    Wall Street sources also said today that a rival bidder
might be discouraged by a breakup fee Purolator would have to
pay if it ends its agreement with Hutton. The sources would not
reveal the amount of the fee, which will be noted in documents
on the transaction to be made public later this week.

Kidder, Peabody Mortgage Assets Trust
Five, a unit of Kidder, Peabody and Co Inc, is offering 500 mln
dlrs of collateralized mortgage obligations in seven classes,
including floating-rate and inverse-rate tranches.
    Sole manager Kidder Peabody said the first floating-rate
class has an initial rate of 6.755 pct that will be reset
quarterly at 40 basis points over three-month LIBOR, with an 11
pct cap.
    Totaling 53.3 mln dlrs, this floating-rate class contains a
so-called catchup provision that allows investors to recapture
possible lost interest, according to Kidder Peabody.
    For instance, if three-month LIBOR rises to 15 pct during
the life of the floating-rate tranche and falls back below the
11 pct cap, investors would be paid back, dollar for dollar,
the amount of interest they would have received if the CMOs did
not carry a maximum interest rate, a Kidder officer said.
    Kidder Peabody introduced this concept on February 12.
    The other floating-rate class totals 132.4 mln dlrs and has
an initial rate of 6.975 pct that will be reset quarterly at 60
basis points over three-month LIBOR, with a 13 pct cap. This
tranche does not have a catch-up provision, the Kidder officer
said.
    The inverse-rate tranche totals 71.3 mln dlrs and has an
initial rate of 10.903 pct. The rate will be reset quarterly
according to the formula of 22.44027 minus the product of
1.8097 times three-month LIBOR.
    Yields on the remaining fixed-rate CMOs, the balance of the
500 mln dlr issue, range from 7-1/4 to 9.27 pct, or 90 to 160
basis points over comparable Treasuries.
    The issue is rated a top-flight AAA by Standard and Poor's.

according to the exchange.
    The maximum daily price limit will be two cts a gallon on
all contracts except spot. Trading will terminate on the last
business day of the month preceding the delivery month.
    The exchange said delivery will be F.O.B from the seller's
pipeline, storage, or fractionation facility in Mont Belvieu,
Texas, which has a direct pipeline access to the Texas Eastern
Transmission Pipeline (TET) in Mont Beliview.
    Delivery method will be by in-line or in-well transfer,

French industry is failing to produce the
goods its markets need and its loss of competitiveness has left
the government little room for manoeuvre to reflate the
economy, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and
Development said.
    With gross domestic product likely to grow only 2.1 pct
this year, the same rate as last year, unemployment could climb
to 11.5 pct of the workforce by mid-1988, from its present 10.9
pct, it said in an annual review of the French economy.
    The report said the French economy was "increasingly
ill-adapted to demand" selling goods at "uncompetitive relative
prices on both domestic and export markets."
    "France's poor export performance reflects a geographical
bias in favour of markets less dynamic than the average...
And...A substantial loss of market share...In the past 18
months," it said.
    Pointing to a likely widening of the French trade deficit
to around 2.9 billion dlrs this year from 2.4 billion in 1986,
it warned that a further depreciation of the dollar against the
franc could lead to "a (renewed) loss of competitiveness
relative not only to the United States but also to the newly
industrialised countries."
    This could result in further major losses of market share,
particularly in the non-OECD area, which accounts for almost a
quarter of French exports, it said.
    Until the competitive ability of industry improved, the
authorities would have "little scope for macroeconomic
manoeuvre, even if the unemployment situation or the need to
encourage a pickup in investment could require demand to grow
more briskly," it added.
    But rising unemployment could help to hold down wage
demands, contributing to a slowdown in inflation to around a
two pct annual rate this year and early next, the OECD said.
    Written mainly in December last year, the report took no
account of a rise in oil prices early in 1987, and a 0.9 pct
surge in January consumer prices, caused partly by the
government's deregulation of service sector tariffs.
    "We took a bet that the freeing of prices would not provoke
runaway rises, and it is not absolutely certain that bet has
been lost," one OECD official commented.
    OECD officials said the January data and a rise in oil
prices above the 15 dlrs a barrel average assumed in the
report, indicated an upward revision in the inflation forecast
to around 2.5 or three pct.
    The government last week revised its forecast up to between
2.4 and 2.5 pct from two pct, against last year's 2.1 pct.
    But the OECD backed the government's view that the
underlying trend for inflation remained downwards this year,
with a slowdown in domestic costs taking over from last year's
fall in oil and commodity prices as the chief cause of
disinflation.
    With French unit productivity costs now among the lowest in
the OECD area, the inflation differential between France and
its main trading rival, West Germany, could fall to just one
pct this year, it said.
    On the other hand, the report noted, consumer prices for
industrial goods and private services have been rising steeply
as companies built up their profits.
    "For the disinflationary process to continue , and price
competitiveness to become lastingly compatible with exchange
rate stability, it is essential that wage restraint continue,"
it said.

The federal Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) is looking for possible securities laws
violations in connection with an unsuccessful 1986 bid by
Hollywood producer Burt Sugarman to take over TRE Corp,
attorneys contacted by SEC investigators said.
    During the takeeover attempt, a unit of Sugarman's Giant
Group Ltd at one point held a 9.9 pct stake in TRE.
    It had help in that effort from Jefferies Group Inc, a Los
Angeles investment banking firm which sold it an option on a
portion of the shares Sugarman eventually acquired.
    In addition, a company controlled by Sugarman raised 35 mln
dlrs in a debt offering underwritten by Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc with help from Jefferies, and used a portion of the
proceeds to buy TRE stock.
    Finally, Reliance Group Holdings Inc acquired nearly six
pct of TRE, according to an SEEC filing.
    The attorneys, who asked not to be identified, said the SEC
was investigating whether Sugarman and other firms with TRE
holdings were working together without disclosing their
cooperation, as would be required by the federal securities

Last week's White House shake-up has
increased the odds that Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul
Volcker, a symbol of strength in a government reeling from the
arms-to-Iran scandal, will serve a third term, sources close to
the Fed say.
    But they said that no decision on the appointment, which
must be filled this August, has been taken by the White House
and Volcker too has not made up his mind.
    Former White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan, who
resigned last week when ex-senator Howard Baker was named as
his replacement, was implacably opposed to Volcker and tried
often to undermine him.
    It is an open secret in Washington that Regan tried to
ensure that Volcker, first appointed in 1979 by President
Carter, will not be offered a third term by President Reagan.
    Only Volcker's key allies in the Reagan administration,
Vice-President George Bush and Treasury Secretary James Baker,
kept Regan's recent maneuvering at bay, the sources said.
    Sources close to the administration say Regan leaked a
story, quickly shot down by others in the administration, that
Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of the council of economic advisers,
had been chosen to replace Volcker.
    But as the administration's credibility was increasingly
under fire, it became clear that Regan's power to bring about
such changes was on the wane.
    The sources said New White House Chief of Staff Howard
Baker has a very good relationship with his namesake at the
Treasury Department and is likely to respect his views on the
Fed chairmanship.
    As a moderate Republican, Baker is also unlikely to share
the right-wing's opposition to Volcker.
    "This new White House is going to need all the strength it
can get," said one source when asked about the possibility of
Volcker's reappointment.
    Paul Volcker is deeply respected in financial markets both
in the United States and around the world. At a time when the
stability of the dollar and the viability of major debtor
nations are in question, Volcker's departure would definitely
undermine U.S. leadership, foreign exchange analysts say.
    U.S. officials say Volcker works very closely with Treasury
Secretary Baker on issues like international debt and global
economic cooperation.
    The two men seem only to differ on how far to deregulate
the banking industry, but recent statements by Volcker, in
which he adopted a more liberal attitude on deregulation,
signalled the politically-independent central bank is coming
around at least partially to the Treasury position.
    And a recent statement by a Reagan administration official
that the two men saw "exactly eye-to-eye" on the dollar was seen
as an indication of Baker's support for the Fed chairman.
    Baker is understood to have played a key role in Volcker's
reappointment to the Fed in mid-1983.
    The sources said Baker respects Volcker and when appointed
Treasury Secretary in February 1985, he decided to ensure a
good working relationship, in part because he believed the two
key government economic institutions have to work closely.
    Regan, Treasury Secretary during President Reagan's first
term, was formerly head of Wall Street's largest brokerage firm
Merrill Lynch and came to Washington determined to be America's
pre-eminent economic spokesman.
    He developed a deep antipathy for Volcker, whose political
skills undermined that ambition, and who financial markets took
much more seriously.
    But the sources said Volcker would have to be invited to
stay. "Is the president going to ask him? he wouldn't stay
otherwise," said one. "He'd have to be asked," said Stephen
Axilrod, formerly staff director of monetary policy at the Fed
and now vice-chairman of Nikko Securities Co. International.
    Otherwise, the list of potential candidates is not
awe-inspiring. And if Volcker left this Augsut, he would leave
behind one of the most inexperienced Fed Boards in years.
    Many analysts believe this lack of collective experience --
the four sitting members were all appointed within the last
three years -- is dangerous, coming at a time when the global
economy is threatened by instability.
    An experienced successor, therefore, would seem a
necessity. One widely mentioned possibility is Secretary of
State George Shultz, whose experience as Treasury Secretary
under Preesident Nixon and background as a trained economist
would make him ideal.
    But Shultz too may have been damaged by the arms-to-Iran
scandal, while vice-chairman Manuel Johnson is regarded at 37
years old as too young for the job.
    Other potential candidates include economist Alan
Greenspan, frequently an informal presidential economic
adviser, New York Fed President E. Gerald Corrigan, Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp chairman William Seidman, and Sprinkel.
    Long a Regan protege, Sprinkel's chances may be damaged by
his patron's departure from the White House.

Contracting for future construction
work declined by three pct in January to an annualized rate of
236.1 billion dlrs, a report on the industry said.
    The report by the F.W. Dodge Division of McGraw-Hill
Information Systems Co said a 10 pct reversal of nonbuilding
construction was largely responsible for the month's setback
from December's higher level.
    Residential building eased three pct in January, while
contracts for commercial, industrial and institutional
buildings rebounded slightly, according to the report.
    Nonbuilding construction, which soared to an annualized
rate of 47.8 billion dlrs in December when last year's only
major electric power plant was started, fell back 10 pct to
43.1 billion.
    Dodge said contracting for highway and bridge construction
advanced five pct in January. However, available funding for
1987 construction could dry up if Congress fails to act after
the Federal highway program runs out of carryover spending
authority.
    Nonresidential buildings edged up one pct in January to an
annualized rate of 77.6 billion. Contracting for institutional
structures, such as schools and health facilities, was the
reason for the gain, the report said.
    Residential building was valued at 115.4 billion dlrs in
January, a decrease of three pct from December's seasonally
adjusted rate, the report stated. However, demand will be
strong for single-family units supported by falling mortgage
rates, but multi-family buildings will not be in high demand as
a result of the tax reform, according to the report.

Japan's seasonally adjusted unemployment
rate rose to a record 3.0 pct in January, the worst since the
Government started compiling unemployment statistics under its
current system in 1953, up from the previous record 2.9 pct in
December, the government's Management and Coordination Agency
said.
    Unemployment was up from 2.8 pct a year earlier.
    Unadjusted January unemployment totalled 1.82 mln people,
up from 1.61 mln in December and 1.65 mln a year earlier.
    Male unemployment in January remained at 2.9 pct, equal to
the second-worst level set last December. Record male
unemployement of 3.1 pct was set in July 1986.
    Female unemployment in January remained at 3.0 pct, equal
to the record level marked in April, August, September and
December last year.
    January's record 3.0 pct unemployment rate mainly stemmed
from loss of jobs in manufacturing industries, particularly in
export-related firms, due to the yen's continuing appreciation
against the dollar, officials said.
    Employment in manufacturing industries fell 380,000 from a
year earlier to 14.30 mln including 1.83 mln employed in the
textile industry, down 190,000 from a year earlier, and 1.06

Japan's unemployment rate is expected to
continue to climb to about 3.5 pct within the next year from
January's three pct record, senior economists, including Susumu
Taketomi of Industrial Bank of Japan, said.
    December's 2.9 pct was the previous worst level since the
government's Management and Coordination Agency began compiling
statistics under its current system in 1953.
    "There is a general fear that we will become a country with
high unemployment," said Takashi Kiuchi, senior economist for
the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd.
    The government, which published the January unemployment
figures today, did not make any predictions.
    "At present we do not have a forecast for the unemployment
rate this year, but it is difficult to foresee the situation
improving," a Labour Ministry official said.
    Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the government had
expected the increase and had set aside money to help 300,000
people find jobs in fiscal 1987 beginning in April.
    Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone told a press conference
the record rate underlines the need to pass the 1987 budget
which has been held up by opposition to proposed tax reforms.
    The yen's surge has caused layoffs in the mainstay steel
and shipbuilding industries. Other export-dependent industries,
such as cars and textiles, have laid off part-time employees
and ceased hiring, economists said.
    Although the growing service industry sector has absorbed a
great number of workers the trend is starting to slow down,
said Koichi Tsukihara, Deputy General Manager of Sumitomo Bank
Ltd's economics department.
    However, other economists disagreed, saying the service
sector would be able to hire workers no longer needed by the
manufacturing sector over the next five years.
    The economists said the service sector should grow as the
government stimulates domestic demand under its program to
transform the economy away from exports.
    Although Japanese unemployment rates appear lower than
those of other industrialised nations, methods for calculating
statistics make them difficult to compare, economists warned.
    "The three pct figure  could translate into a relatively
high figure if European methods were used," one economist said.
More than half of January's 170,000 increase in jobless from a
year earlier were those aged between 15 and 24, Sumitomo's
Tsukihara said.

Fisons Plc <FISN.L> said strong
international growth had been the main feature of the group's
1986 progress, with the pharmaceutical division reporting a 50
pct increase in U.S. Sales during the period.
    The rise was due to a sustained marketing programme, a
larger sales force and the introduction of an aerosol form of
its Intal anti-asthma drug, which pushed U.S. Sales up 70 pct.
    The company was commenting on 1986 results which saw
pre-tax profits rising to 85.1 mln stg from 72.3 mln in 1985.
The result was in line with market forecasts, but its shares
nevertheless eased in a falling market to 634p at 0857 GMT from
643p.
    Fisons said the potential for future growth of Intral, as
well as its Opticrom and Nasalcrom products, was clearly

    The scientific equipment business had raised the proportion
of high technology products it manufactures and also raised its
ability to generate higher margins. The horticulture operations
had demonstrated outstanding marketing ability. Underlying cash
flow from all three operations had been positive despite a full

The Federation of Bankers' Associations of
Japan released its proposal for early creation of a
comprehensive financial futures market in Tokyo.
    The market should include a comprehensive range of futures
and options trading so Tokyo can develop into a real global
money centre where a variety of risk-hedging instruments is
available, the proposal said.
    It should provide currency and interest rate futures, and
incorporate the existing yen bond futures and planned stock
index futures contracts.
    The proposal said transactions in all these contracts must
be conducted on the same market so participants can readily
engage in arbitrage between various financial instruments.
    To make this possible, the proposal calls for new
legislation which would administer all related futures and
options transactions under the same legal framework.
    Banking sources said they expect that initially the
currency futures would be dollar-yen and interest futures would
include Japanese domestic yen certificates of deposit,
three-month Eurodollar deposits and 20-year U.S. Treasury
bonds.
    Banking sources quoted federation chairman Yoshiro Araki as
saying he hoped the market would be created as soon as possible
because it would help promote the liberalisation of Japan's
financial markets.
    Araki said he had no intention of limiting prospective
market participants to banks but was willing to accept those
from wider business circles, the sources said.
    Japan's only current financial futures market, in yen
bonds, began on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in October 1985.

Early dollar straight eurobond trade was
quiet with currency sectors, particularly eurosterling,
continuing to perform strongly, closely reflecting current
trading patterns on the foreign exchanges, dealers said.
    Eurosterling bonds continued to rise steadily, bolstered by
the extremely ebullient tone of the U.K. Government bond market
on a combination of positive U.K. Economic fundamentals.
    The dollar was initially stabler but most dollar straight
bonds were static in dull trade. A handful of issues showed
signs of weakness but dealers said investors were awaiting
today's release of U.S. Leading indicators for January.
    The U.S. Data due out this afternoon is expected to be
weak, placing the U.S. Unit under renewed pressure and robbing
the market in dollar-denominated eurobonds of fresh trading
impetus, one dollar straight trader said.
    "It's going to be another tedious day and I can't see how
anybody is going to make any money," he said.
    Eurosterling issues continued to rally on the back of
general sterling euphoria -- with the U.K. Currency trading at
six month highs on interest rate optimism and the strength of
the domestic equity markets.
    Eurosterling bonds saw early gains of up to half a point.
    However, some eurosterling dealers noted the bonds could
soon fall back marginally if -- as expected -- professionals
stepped in to take profits at current healthy levels.
    Trade in mark-denominated bonds was expected to be subdued
today due to pre-Lenten carnival festivities in West Germany.
    There were signs of reawakened investor nerves affecting

pct.
    The other issue was a 100 mln dlr deal -- also due 1992 --
for NV Nederlandse Gasunie paying 7-1/4 pct and priced at
101-1/8 pct, with Citicorp Investment Bank Ltd as lead manager.
    Dealers predicted reasonable demand for both issues due
mainly to a lack of fresh, good name paper in the market.

The Bundesbank is unlikely to change
its credit policies at its central bank council meeting on
Thursday, as exchange rates and short-term interest rates have
stabilized over the past few weeks, money market dealers said.
    Attention in the money market is focused on tomorrow's
tender for a securities repurchase pact, from which funds will
be credited on Thursday, when an earlier pact expires, draining
16 billion marks from the system.
    The tender was announced last Friday, because carnival
festivities closed banks in Duesseldorf yesterday, and will
close banks here this afternoon.
    Because of the disruption to business from carnival,
minimum reserve figures for the start of the month are
unrealistic, making it difficult for banks to assess their
needs at the tender.
    Dealers said the Bundesbank would want to inject enough
liquidity in this week's pact to keep short-term rates down.
    But because of uncertainty about banks' current holdings,
the Bundesbank may well allocate less than 16 billion marks
this week, and top it up if necessary at next week's tender.
    "I would not be surprised if the Bundesbank cuts the amount
a little, to say 14 or 15 billion marks," one dealer said.
    "They would then stock it up at the next tender when the
need is clearer," he added.
    An earlier pact expires next week, draining 8.5 billion
marks from the system. Banks also face a heavy but temporary
drain this month from a major tax deadline for customers.
    Banks held 52.0 billion marks on February 27 at the
Bundesbank, averaging 51.0 billion over the whole month, just
clear of the 50.5 billion February reserve requirement.

Britain's gold and currency reserves
showed an underlying rise of 287 mln dlrs in February, after a
72 mln dlrs rise in January, the Treasury said.
    The underlying trend, which is a guide to Bank of England
operations to support the pound on foreign exchanges, is net of
borrowings and repayments.
    This was above market expectations for a 100 mln dlrs rise.
    The Treasury said the Bank of England used the opportunity
of strong demand to rebuild reserves after losses last autumn
and said the underlying rise was still relatively modest.
    Actual reserves rose by 305 mln dlrs in February to 22.26
billion dlrs, after rising 29 mln in January to 21.95 billion.
    Accruals of borrowings under the exchange cover scheme were
36 mln dlrs last month, after 163 mln in January, while
repayments were 16 mln dlrs after the previous 151 mln, a
Treasury spokesman said.
    Capital repayments totalled two mln dlrs. In January,
capital repayments totalled 14 mln dlrs, with a valuation
change that resulted in a fall of 41 mln dlrs due to the
quarterly rollover from the European Monetary Cooperation Fund
swap.
    The Treasury would not comment on the Bank of England's
market operations, but currency traders reported moderate Bank
of England intervention to curb upward pressure on the pound
today.
    A Treasury spokesman, commenting on the reserves figures,
said that the government does not want sterling either to rise
too far or to fall substantially from current levels.
    He noted that the Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson
stressed this after the recent Paris currencies meeting.

Japan's unemployment rate is expected to
continue to climb to about 3.5 pct within the next year from
January's three pct record, senior economists, including Susumu
Taketomi of Industrial Bank of Japan, said.
    December's 2.9 pct was the previous worst level since the
government's Management and Coordination Agency began compiling
statistics under its current system in 1953.
    "There is a general fear that we will become a country with
high unemployment," said Takashi Kiuchi, senior economist for
the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd.
    The government, which published the January unemployment
figures today, did not make any predictions.
    "At present we do not have a forecast for the unemployment
rate this year, but it is difficult to foresee the situation
improving," a Labour Ministry official said.
    Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the government had
expected the increase and had set aside money to help 300,000
people find jobs in fiscal 1987 beginning in April.
    Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone told a press conference
the record rate underlines the need to pass the 1987 budget
which has been held up by opposition to proposed tax reforms.
    The yen's surge has caused layoffs in the mainstay steel
and shipbuilding industries. Other export-dependent industries,
such as cars and textiles, have laid off part-time employees
and ceased hiring, economists said.
    Although the growing service industry sector has absorbed a
great number of workers the trend is starting to slow down,
said Koichi Tsukihara, Deputy General Manager of Sumitomo Bank
Ltd's economics department.
    However, other economists disagreed, saying the service
sector would be able to hire workers no longer needed by the
manufacturing sector over the next five years.

Daimler-Benz AG [DAIG.F] said its car
production could fall by 150 cars a day in  the foreseeable
future  if works councils continue to refuse to approve the
firm's requests for employees to work overtime when necessary.
    A company spokesman said the works council at Daimler's
Unterturkheim plant, which makes axles and other components for
Daimler cars, has withheld approval for overtime since the
beginning of the month. The IG Metall metalworkers union in the
state of Baden-Wuerttemberg has called on works councils in the
state to reject overtime in a bid to get industry to employ
more workers.
    The Daimler spokesman said the lack of overtime work at the
Unterturkheim plant could eventually affect car output at other
plants but added he was unable to say when this might occur.
    A spokesman for Dr.-Ing. H.C. F. Porsche AG [PSHG.F], which

Porsche would suffer any loss of production because of a ban on
overtime by its own works councils.

down the German car industry for about seven weeks as the union
sought to win a 35-hour working week for its members. It later
settled for a reduction in the working week to 38.5 hours.

Last week's White House shake-up has
increased the odds that Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul
Volcker, a symbol of strength in a government reeling from the
arms-to-Iran scandal, will serve a third term, sources close to
the Fed say.
    But they said that no decision on the appointment, which
must be filled this August, has been taken by the White House
and Volcker too has not made up his mind.
    Former White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan, who
resigned last week when ex-senator Howard Baker was named as
his replacement, was implacably opposed to Volcker and tried
often to undermine him.
    It is an open secret in Washington that Regan tried to
ensure that Volcker, first appointed in 1979 by President
Carter, will not be offered a third term by President Reagan.
    Only Volcker's key allies in the Reagan administration,
Vice-President George Bush and Treasury Secretary James Baker,
kept Regan's recent maneuvering at bay, the sources said.
    Sources close to the administration say Regan leaked a
story, quickly shot down by others in the administration, that
Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of the council of economic advisers,
had been chosen to replace Volcker.
    But as the administration's credibility was increasingly
under fire, it became clear that Regan's power to bring about
such changes was on the wane.
    The sources said New White House Chief of Staff Howard
Baker has a very good relationship with his namesake at the
Treasury Department and is likely to respect his views on the
Fed chairmanship.
    As a moderate Republican, Baker is also unlikely to share
the right-wing's opposition to Volcker.
    "This new White House is going to need all the strength it
can get," said one source when asked about the possibility of
Volcker's reappointment.
    Paul Volcker is deeply respected in financial markets both
in the United States and around the world. At a time when the
stability of the dollar and the viability of major debtor
nations are in question, Volcker's departure would definitely
undermine U.S. leadership, foreign exchange analysts say.
    U.S. officials say Volcker works very closely with Treasury
Secretary Baker on issues like international debt and global
economic cooperation.
    The two men seem only to differ on how far to deregulate
the banking industry, but recent statements by Volcker, in
which he adopted a more liberal attitude on deregulation,
signalled the politically-independent central bank is coming
around at least partially to the Treasury position.
    And a recent statement by a Reagan administration official
that the two men saw "exactly eye-to-eye" on the dollar was seen
as an indication of Baker's support for the Fed chairman.
    Baker is understood to have played a key role in Volcker's
reappointment to the Fed in mid-1983.
    The sources said Baker respects Volcker and when appointed
Treasury Secretary in February 1985, he decided to ensure a
good working relationship, in part because he believed the two
key government economic institutions have to work closely.
    Regan, Treasury Secretary during President Reagan's first
term, was formerly head of Wall Street's largest brokerage firm
Merrill Lynch and came to Washington determined to be America's
pre-eminent economic spokesman.
    He developed a deep antipathy for Volcker, whose political
skills undermined that ambition, and who financial markets took
much more seriously.
    But the sources said Volcker would have to be invited to
stay. "Is the president going to ask him? he wouldn't stay
otherwise," said one. "He'd have to be asked," said Stephen
Axilrod, formerly staff director of monetary policy at the Fed
and now vice-chairman of Nikko Securities Co. International.
    Otherwise, the list of potential candidates is not
awe-inspiring. And if Volcker left this Augsut, he would leave
behind one of the most inexperienced Fed Boards in years.
    Many analysts believe this lack of collective experience --
the four sitting members were all appointed within the last
three years -- is dangerous, coming at a time when the global
economy is threatened by instability.
    An experienced successor, therefore, would seem a
necessity. One widely mentioned possibility is Secretary of
State George Shultz, whose experience as Treasury Secretary
under Preesident Nixon and background as a trained economist
would make him ideal.
    But Shultz too may have been damaged by the arms-to-Iran
scandal, while vice-chairman Manuel Johnson is regarded at 37
years old as too young for the job.
    Other potential candidates include economist Alan
Greenspan, frequently an informal presidential economic
adviser, New York Fed President E. Gerald Corrigan, Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp chairman William Seidman, and Sprinkel.
    Long a Regan protege, Sprinkel's chances may be damaged by
his patron's departure from the White House.

General Motors Corp has changed its
method of disbursing merit raises for salaried employees and is

    He said GM will no longer include merit raises in the
calculation of base pay but will make them simply lump-sum
payments.  As a result, the merit raises will not be included
in the calculation of pensions and other benefits.  The change

    GM last year eliminated cost of living increases for
salaried workers, making pay increases based on merit alone. As
a result of the new action, GM has effectively frozen the base
pay rates of salaried employees.
    The spokesman said GM is making the change to remain

the more conventional practice of depreciating assets
individually rather than depreciating fixed assets at average
rates. The new method is expected to lead to a reduction in the
accumulated provision for depreciation and thereby increase the
net book value of tangible asssets by about 300 mln stg as at

The U.S. index of leading indicators
fell a seasonally adjusted 1.0 pct in January after a revised
2.3 pct December gain, the Commerce Department said.
    The department previously said the index rose 2.1 pct in
December.
    The decline in January was the biggest for any month since
July, 1984, when the index fell 1.7 pct.
    The January decrease left the index at 183.8 over its 1967
base of 100, and was led by a fall in contracts and orders for
plant and equipment.
    A total of six of 10 indicators available for January
contributed to the decline.
    Besides contracts and orders for plant and equipment, they
were building permits, manufacturers' new orders for consumer
goods, a change in sensitive materials prices, slower
deliveries from vendors and higher average weekly claims for
state unemployment insurance.
    Four of 10 indicators were positive, including stock
prices, new business formation, average work week and money
supply.
    The main factor for the December upward revision was new
business formation.
    There was no revision in the 0.9 pct increase in the
leading indicators index for November.
    The index of coincident indicators, which measures the
current economy, fell 0.1 pct in January after increases of 0.7

AMR Corp's American Airlines said it
will buy 40 long-range jet aircraft to support international
expansion, including routes in the Caribbean.
    Under one agreement, the airline said, it will acquire 15
Boeing Co <BA> 767-300 planes. Under a separate agreement,
American will acquire A-300-600 aircraft from <Airbus
Industrie>, a European consortium.
    The company's announcement included no value for the order.
    Published reports put the value of the aircraft order,
including engines, at 2.5 billion dlrs.
    A total of 98 General Electric Co <GE> CF6-80C2 engines is
involved in the orders, American Airlines said.
    The published reports valued the engines at five mln dlrs
each.
    The company said it will acquire the planes and engines
using rental leases that can be terminated on relatively short
notice.
    The arrangement allows the airline to acquire the planes
without adding to its debt, it explained.
    The Boeing 767s, to be delivered from February 1988 to
October 1988, will be used on routes between the U.S. and
Europe, American said.
    It said the Airbus A300s, scheduled for delivery from April
1988 through June 1989, will be assigned to the Caribbean,

Equatorial Communications
Co said it expects to report losses of about 57 mln dlrs for
the fourth quarter and 68 mln dlrs for the full year 1986 on
revenues of about 10 mln dlrs for the quarter and 52 mln dlrs
for the year.
    Equatorial said the losses will include a charge of about
45 mln dlrs from costs associated with the restructuring of its
business, including adjustments to reflect the market value of
transponders owned and leased by Equatorial and other reserves
for inventory, receivables and excess facilities.
    Equatorial said the fourth quarter operating results will
also include restructuring costs of about 5,500,000 dlrs, in
addition to the 45 mln dlr charge.
    Equitorial also said that as of March One it is operating
in technical default under its lease of transponders on the
Galaxy III satellite due to its inabiliuty to maintain
agreed-upon financial ratios.  It said it is in talks with the
lessors in an attempt to restructure lease obligations.
    Further, Equitorial said it is in default of two other
oblitations in connection with the purchase or lease of
transponders as a result of cross-default provisions.
    Equatorial said it has signed a memorandum of understanding
for Contel Corp <CTC> to purchase 10 mln dlrs of Equatorial
master earth stations, micro earth stations and associated
equipment and loan Equatorial six mln dlrs over a six-month
period for repayment starting in December 1988.
    The company said Conteol, under the agreement, would assume
a portion of Equatorial's rights and obligations under the
Galaxy III transponder lease with <Burnham Leasing> on the
occurrence of certain events.
    Equatorial said it would grant Contel an option to buy
about 3,600,000 common shares at 3.25 dlrs each.
    Equatorial said its understandings with Contel are subject
to Equatorial's ability to restructure a significant portion of
its obligations and to obtain concessions from lenders and
lessors, in particular under its Galaxy III transponder lease.
It said it hopes to finalize a Contel agreement by April 15.
    Equatorial in 1985 earned 1,807,000 dlrs after a 3,197,000
dlr gain from early debt retirement on revenues of 56.1 mln
dlrs. For the first nine months of 1986, the company lost
9,476,000 dlrs on revenues of 45.4 mln dlrs, compared with a
1,784,000 dlr profit after the early retirement gain on
revenues of 38.5 mln dlrs.

Unilever Plc <UN.A> and NV group reported
improvements in margins and underlying sales volume growth of
five pct in 1986 after stripping out the effects of falling
prices, disposals and currency movements, Unilever Plc chairman
Michael Angus said.
    He told reporters that volumes in North America increased
some 10.5 pct while European consumer goods rose about 2.5 pct
after being flat for some years.
    Much of the disposal strategy, aimed at concentrating
activities on core businesses, had now been completed, he
noted.
    But the process of acquisitions would go on, with strategic
acquisitions taking place "from time to time," he said.
    The company earlier reported a 20 pct rise in pre-tax
profits for 1986 to 1.14 billion stg from 953 mln previously.
In guilder terms, however, profits at the pre-tax level dropped
three pct to 3.69 billion from 3.81 billion.
    Angus said the recent purchase of Chesebrough-Pond's Inc
<CBM.N> for 72.50 dlrs a share was unlikely to bring any
earnings dilution.
    However, it would not add much to profits, with much of the
company's operating profits paying for the acquisition costs.
    Finance director Niall Fitzgerald added that while gearing
- debt to equity plus debt - rose to about 60 pct at end 1986
from 35 pct last year, this was expected to drop back to about
40 pct by end-1987.
    The same divergence was made in full year dividend, with
Unilever NV's rising 3.4 pct to 15.33 guilders and Unilever
Plc's increasing 29.9 pct to 50.17p, approximately in line with
the change in attributable profit.
    Angus said the prospectus for the sale of parts of
Chesebrough was due to be published shortly. However, he said
that there was no target date for completing the process.
    He also declined to say what sort of sum Unilever hoped to
realise from the operation, beyond noting that Chesebrough had
paid around 1.25 billion dlrs for Stauffer Chemical Co, which
operates outside Unilever's core activities.
    In the U.S., Organic growth from the Lipton Foods business,
considerable expansion in the household products business and
in margarine had been behind the overall sales increase.
    However, he noted that the U.S. Household products business
had turned in a planned loss, with fourth quarter performance
better than expected despite the anticipated heavy launch costs
of its Surf detergents.

Eastman Kodak Co said it is introducing
four information technology systems that will be led by today's
highest-capacity system for data storage and retrieval.
    The company said information management products will be
the focus of a multi-mln dlr business-to-business
communications campaign under the threme "The New Vision of
Kodak."
    Noting that it is well-known as a photographic company,
Kodak said its information technology sales exceeded four
billion dlrs in 1986. "If the Kodak divisions generating those
sales were independent, that company would rank among the top
100 of the Fortune 500," it pointed out.
    The objective of Kodak's "new vision" communications
campaign, it added, is to inform others of the company's
commitment to the business and industrial sector.
    Kodak said the campaign will focus in part on the
information management systems unveilded today --
    -- The Kodak optical disk system 6800 which can store more
than a terabyte of information (a tillion bytes).
    - The Kodak KIMS system 5000, a networked information
management system using optical disks or microfilm or both.
    -- The Kodak KIMS system 3000, an optical-disk-based system
that allows users to integrate optical disks into their current
information management systems.
    -- The Kodak KIMS system 4500, a microfilm-based,
computer-assisted system which can be a starter system.
    Kodak said the optical disy system 6800 is a
write-once/ready-many-times type its Mass Memory Division will
market on a limited basis later this year and in quantity in
1988.
    Each system 6800 automated disk library can accommodate up
to 150, 14-inch optical disks. Each disk provides 6.8 gigabytes
of randomly accessible on-line storage. Thus, Kodak pointed
out, 150 disks render the more-than-a-terabyte capacity.
    Kodak said it will begin deliveries of the KIMS system 5000
in mid-1987. The open-ended and media-independent system 
allows users to incorporate existing and emerging technologies,
including erasable optical disks, high-density magnetic media,
fiber optics and even artificial intelligence, is expected to
sell in the 700,000 dlr range.
    Initially this system will come in a 12-inch optical disk
version which provides data storage and retrieval through a
disk library with a capacity of up to 121 disks, each storing
2.6 gigabytes.
    Kodak said the KIMS system 3000 is the baseline member of
the family of KIMS systems. Using one or two 12-inch manually
loaded optical disk drives, it will sell for about 150,000 dlrs
with deliveries beginning in mid-year.
    The company said the system 3000 is fulling compatibal with
the more powerful KIMS system 5000.
    It said the KIMS system 4500 uses the same hardware and
software as the system 5000. It will be available in mid-1987
and sell in the 150,000 dlr range.

Bangor Hydro-Electric Cor said it
has filed with the Maine Public Utilities Commission (MPUC) for
a two-stage base rate reduction.
    Bangor Hydro said the first stage, which could take effect
on April 1 and would stay effective until the MPUC makes a
final decision on the filing, could cut revenues by 6.149 mln
dlrs, or 9.7 pct.
    The company said lower federal income taxes and lower
capital costs prompted the filing.
    The second stage, Bangor Hydro said, effective when the
MPUC makes a final decision, calls for an additional revenue
reduction of 712,000 dlrs, or 1.1 pct.
    Bangor Hydro said, if approved, the cuts would reduce
residential base rates by 8.5 pct, with 7.5 pct cut by April 1.
    The utility company also said it is seeking to increase its
fuel cost adjustment rate by April 1.
    Bangor said if the increase is approved it could offset
much of the base rate cut and may cause a net increase in some

Pharmacia AB <PHAB ST> forecast
earnings after financial items of one billion crowns in 1987 vs
821.2 mln last year on condition that exchange rates remained
at their present parities.
    Sales would in such circumstances go up to six billion
crowns from 3.65 billion in 1986, it said.
    A weakening Dollar was mainly responsible for a five pct
negative impact on sales during 1986 which the company blamed
on currency movements.
    Last year's results were also badly hit by a once-off
writedown of 520 mln crowns for intangible assets.
    The company said mainly this represented the premium the
group had paid for the know-how of various high-tech firms it
had taken over.
    The accounts also showed a financial deficit of 1.87
billion crowns vs a deficit of 133 mln which was covered partly
by drawing down company liquidity to 738 mln vs one billion and
partly by increasing borrowing to 2.23 billion vs 621 mln.
    Pharmacia said the financial deficit was caused by it
having used more funds than generated by group operations,
mainly because of the 1.36 billion it paid in cash for shares
in LKB-Produkter AB and the assets of Intermedics-Intraocular

Former Treasury official C. Fred
Bergsten said a new exchange rate system is needed to replace
the fixed and flexible exchange rate systems which he said had
not worked.
    "I prefer a move to 'target zones' in which the major
countries would determine ranges of 15-20 pct within which they
would pledge to hold their exchange rates by direct
intervention and, as necessary, by changes in monetary and
other policies," Bergsten, now the director of the Institute
for International Economics, said in a statement to a House
Banking subcommittee.
    "The substantial correction of the exchange rate that has
occurred since early 1985 is enormously welcome, and should
produce a sizeable reduction in the U.S. trade deficit this
year and next, but the imbalance will not fall much below 100
billion dlrs on present policies, so much more is needed," he
said.

Canada's current account deficit widened
to a seasonally adjusted 2.27 billion dlrs in the fourth
quarter from a deficit of 1.94 billion dlrs in the third,
Statistics Canada said.
    The shortfall for the full year rose to 8.81 billion dlrs

    The agency said the rise in the merchandise surplus, to
2.77 billion dlrs from 2.20 billion dlrs in the third quarter,
was more than offset by high deficits in servicies and
investment. The total non-merchandise deficit grew to 5.04
billion dlrs from 4.14 billion dlrs.
    The current account deficit was 912 mln dlrs in the fourth
quarter of 1985.
    In the capital account, not seasonally adjusted, there was
a total net inflow of 4.76 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter,
up from a net inflow of 3.22 billion dlrs in the third quarter
quarter.

fresh start provision allowed the company to discount opening

into earnings.
    Loynes said the provision's potential benefit would decline

Ford Motor Co of Canada Ltd,
90 pct owned by Ford Motor Co <F>, said the earlier reported
decline in full year net profit was mainly due to changeoover
costs at its Essex, Ontario engine plant.
    Ford Canada also said sharply improved fourth quarter
results were due to improved cost recovery and lower product
program costs, partially offset by lower engine production.
    The company earlier said consolidated 1986 net income fell
to 101.9 mln dlrs from year-ago 199.0 mln dlrs. Fourth quarter
profit improved to 67.7 mln dlrs from 4.5 mln dlrs in the prior
year.
    Ford Canada said full-year earnings from its Canadian
operations declined 75.4 mln dlrs to 104.0, while fourth
quarter profit increased to 49.1 mln dlrs from 16.1 mln dlrs in
the prior year.
    Ford Canada reported a full year loss of 2.9 mln dlrs from
its overseas operations, compared to a 19.6 mln dlr profit in
1985. Fourth quarter earnings from overseas operations rose to
18.6 mln dlrs from a loss of 11.6 mln dlrs in the prior year.
    The company reported full-year domestic sales in Canada of
4.35 billion dlrs compared to 3.95 billion dlrs in 1985,
excluding export sales to its U.S. parent.
    Ford Canada said it had 1986 export sales to its parent
company of 7.97 billion dlrs, up from year-earlier 7.18 billion
dlrs.
    The company reported 1986 overseas sales fell 205.7 mln
dlrs to 2.01 billion dlrs from 2.21 billion dlrs in 1985.
    The company attributed the improvement in fourth quarter
results from overseas operations to manufacturing efficiencies,
cost reduction programs and improved cost recovery, which were
partially offset by lower industry volumes.
    Ford Canada's net loss for the year from overseas
operations resulted from lower industry volumes and increased
interest costs, the company said.
    Despite increased competition, Ford Canada's market share
of car sales rose to 17.2 pct from 17.0 pct in 1985, it said.
The company's share of industry truck sales rose to 29.7 pct in
1986 from year-earlier 29.2 pct.
    Ford Canada said sales were boosted by its Ford Tempo car
and Ford light truck, both manufactured in Oakville, which were

Firestone Tire and Rubber Co has
notified the United Rubber Workers the company will close its
Des Moines, Iowa, Bloomington, Ill., and Oklahoma City tire
plants on or before September 15.
    A Firestone spokesman said the cost of the closings will be
covered by the 65 mln dlrs restructuring charge the company
took in the fourth quarter of 1986.
    The company said it was notified by the union March one
that the agreement reached with Local 998 at the Oklahoma City
tire plant had been rejected by union members at the other
plants. 
    Firestone said it has been discussing the possible sale of
its Des Moines and Bloomington plants with prospective buyers
for several months.
    Those discussions are continuing, the company said, adding
it could not predict their outcome. Firestone is willing to
work with any organization wishing to consider the purchase of
the three tire plants, it added.
    Last October, Firestone advised the union the tire plants
in Des Moines, Bloomington and Oklahoma City were being
designated as "distressed" under the terms of its master
agreement with the rubber workers.
    Firestone said it has twice reached agreement with the
leadership and members of the local in Oklahoma City on plans
to reduce operating costs through revisions in wages, benefits
and work rules.
    Union procedures, however, require approval by the
Firestone section of the union's International Policy
Committee, membrs of other locals covered by the master
contract and by the rubber workers' executive board.
    The company said the rejection of the Oklahoma City package
by union locals at Des Moines and other locations and the
limited sales and profit opportunities for agricultural and
off-the-road tires in North America led Firestone to conclude
the parties would be unable to reach agreements that would
permit the continued operation of the Des Moines and
Bloomington plants.

<Royal Bank of Canada> said it
estimates 1987 loan losses at one billion dlrs, a 25 mln dlr
increase over last year.
    Royal Bank said it set its provisions "given the continued
debt-servicing problems ... in the North American energy
industry and the uncertain outlook for energy prices," and also
continued to add to its general provisions for loans to
troubled borrower countries.
    The bank's loan loss provision for the first quarter ended
January 31 rose to 223 mln dlrs from 187 mln dlrs in the
year-ago quarter.
    The bank said non-accrual loans, net of provisions for loan
losses, totalled 2.2 billion dlrs on January 31, up from 2.0
billion dlrs a year ago.
    In reporting lower first quarter earnings, chairman Allan
Taylor said problems with credit quality--particularly in loans
associated with the energy sector--continue to have a
substantial adverse effect on the bank's earnings.
    Taylor said profitability of the bank's international
operations remains weak, reflecting resource-related
difficulties of private and public sector borrowers and
unsatisfactory results from capital market activities.
    Taylor said it would be premature to speculate on the
outcome of debt resturcturing negotiations with Brazil or their
potential impact on the Royal Bank.

The London Stock Exchange's traded
options market plans volume growth of at least 80 pct a year,
and will more than double the range of options available by the
end of 1988, options committee chairman Geoffrey Chamberlain
said.
    He told a news conference that more options contracts were
traded in 1986 than in the previous seven years of the market's
existence.
    Chamberlain said the daily average volume of contracts
traded in February this year almost tripled to 53,056 from
19,034 in the same month last year, and further rapid growth
was expected.
    "We're aiming for 100 stock option classes by the end of
1988," said Chamberlain. These would correspond to the eligible
constituents of the FT-SE 100 share index.
    Chamberlain added that two new equity options were to be
introduced this month. Options will be available in Sears Plc
<SEHL.L> from March 4, and in Plessey Co. Plc <PLYL.L> from
March 19.
    The London Stock Exchange is the largest outside the United
States for options trading. Forty-five equity options, two
currency options, two government bond (gilt) options and an
option on the FTSE-100 index are available at present.
    Chamberlain said the Stock Exchange aimed to consolidate
the London options market's leading position in Europe,
especially important with French and Swiss equity options
trading planned to start this year.
    "I'd go so far as to say the plans for growth are
conservative," one leading options analyst said, predicting
continuing volume growth of around 20 pct a month for at least
the next year.
    He said much of the recent growth in options had come from
inter-market-maker trading aimed at hedging book positions. But
now the retail options market was beginning to take off.
    The market trades from a corner of the now largely deserted
floor of the London Stock Exchange. The floor has been left
almost empty in the wake of the recent regulatory changes in
the equity and gilts (government bond) markets, which have
encouraged a move to electronic off-floor trading.
    Yesterday, the Stock Exchange decided to close the floor to
equities trading altogether, and said it expected to make a
final decision on the floor's future by the end of 1987.
    The floor space could be used for a purpose-built options
market, but Chamberlain said that it was unlikely that the
options market would need more than half of the available
space.

<Royal Bank of Canada>, in reporting a
19 pct drop in first quarter earnings, said it expects to
report improved results in future earnings periods.
    "Healthy consumer credit growth, record fee-based income,
highly profitable securities and foreign exchange trading, and
a solid capital position...combined with the restraint of
non-interest expenses, should lead to improved results in the
periods ahead," chairman Allan Taylor said in a statement.
    The bank earlier reported profit for the first quarter
ended January 31 fell to 114 mln dlrs from 140 mln dlrs a year
ago.
    Taylor said loans to the energy sector continue to
substantially hurt earnings while profitability of the bank's
international operations remains weak, reflecting
resource-related difficulties of private and public sector
borrowers and unsatisfactory results from capital market
activities.
    The bank said earnings from domestic operations rose to 103
mln dlrs in the first quarter from 98 mln dlrs a year ago while
earnings from international operations plunged to 11 mln dlrs
from 42 mln dlrs last year.
    Royal Bank said first quarter international net interest
income declined from last year, reflecting reduced revenues
from international investment banking as well as a significant
loss on disposal of its affiliate in Trinidad and Tobago.
    Other income rose to 251 mln dlrs from 220 mln dlrs last
year. The rise was due to higher commercial banking and retail
deposit service fees, and higher foreign exchange revenue but
lower securities commissions from international investment bank
operations partly offset the gains, Royal Bank said.
    The bank said a two billion dlr increase in total assets to
98.7 billion dlrs was due mainly to continued growth in
consumer lending, particularly residential mortgages.

House Ways and Means Committee
Chairman Dan Rostenkowski said Congress must avoid a temptation
to pass a protectionist trade bill this year.
    In remarks prepared for delivery before the National Press
Club, Rostenkowski, D-Ill., predicted major trade legislation
will be sent to President Reagan by the end of this year.
    But he warned that his "conciliatory message" on the trade
bill did not mean he would oppose a proposal that would warn
other countries their access to the American market would be
curtailed unless they opened their markets to U.S. goods.
    "Complaints about (foreign trade) restraints are not a
smoke screen for protectionism, they a plea for fairness,"
Rostenkowski said.
    "It is only reasonable to ask the nations that have denied
us access to open up in return for continued freedom in the
American market," he added.
    However, he said there would likely be changes in the
market access proposal from the plan which cleared the House
last year. That plan would have set a specific time table for
foreign countries to ease import restraints or they would face
a 25 pct cut in exports to the United States.

Anacomp Inc, one of the most actively
traded NYSE issues, rose today as at least one analyst expected
earnings to be boosted by its planned acquisition of a
micrographics company.
    Anacomp rose 1/2 to 6-3/4 on volume of 950,000 shares after
trading as high as seven earlier.
    Howard Harlow, analyst at Whale Securities Corp, said
Anacomp's earnings for fiscal 1987 ending September 31 could be
doubled to 80 cts a share from the 40 cts a share he had
forecast before Anacomp agreed to buy DatagraphiX, a
micrographics firm, from General Dynamics Corp <GD>.
    "The company can earn 80 cts a share in fiscal 1987, maybe
as much as a dlr a share, because of DatagraphiX," Harlow said.
"Most of the benefit will be in the fourth qtr because it will
integrate the company in the second half."
    Anacomp's earnings will be less if it has problems
integrating DatagraphiX, Harlow said.
    A spokesman at Anacomp said the company expects to complete
its deal for DatagraphiX later this month. She would not say
how much it will pay for DatagraphiX, but noted that
DatagraphiX contributed 10 mln dlrs in earnings to General
Dynamics on revenues of 239 mln dlrs in 1986.
    Harlow said a fellow analyst at Whale Securities estimates
that Anacomp will pay between 100 mln dlrs to 150 mln dlrs for
DatagraphiX. "The estimates on the street narrow it down to
between 110 mln dlrs and 130 mln dlrs," Harlow added.
    Anacomp reported net of 2.8 mln dlrs or nine cts a share in
its first qtr ended December 31, up from 301,000 dlrs or one ct
a share.
    In Anacomp's fiscal 1986 it earned 4,073,000 dlrs or 13 cts
a share.
    Whale Securities recommends buying the stock, Harlow said.

Export Credits Guarantee Department has
named Malcolm Stephens, director of export finance at Barclay's
Bank Plc and a former career civil servant at ECGD for 17
years, to the post of executive director, a department
spokesman said.
    Stephens replaces Jack Gill, who is retiring early aged 57.
    A drop in the ECGD's business volume and a rise in its debt
to the Exchequer have led to criticism in Parliament in recent
years.
    Stephens said the fall in business volume was a top
convern, adding that the department may have to compete more
aggressively with private insurance firms providing similar
services.
    The department's annual report for the year ended March 31,
1986, showed exports insured by the department fell to 15.7
billion stg from 17.4 billion the year before, while its debt
to the Exchequer almost doubled to 756 mln stg.
    Stephens said he had no specific list of changes. But among
his chief concerns was the weakened condition of lesser
developed countries and their ability to pay for their imports.
    The agency will have to review its policies on insuring
export credits to lesser credits on a country by country basis,
he said. "Large lump political risk insurance is the sort of
thing we want to take a look at."
    "You have to try to look forward to see if you are simply in
a peak and trough situation or it is a more long term thing,"
Stephens said, in response to a qustion about whether ECGD will
strike more countries from its list of political risk insurance
recipients.
    He noted that certain countries have already been removed
from the list.

Visible stocks of 17 oils and fats are
probably peaking now and are likely to fall sharply by October
1 this year, the Oil World newsletter said.
    Oil World forecast that stocks of oils and fats may be cut
to only 9.8 mln tonnes at the end of this season, compared with
10.6 mln a year earlier.
    Its survey covered  13 oils -- soy, cotton, groundnut, sun,
rape, sesame, corn, olive, coconut, palmkernel, palm, lin and
castor  -- and four animal oils and fats -- butter, fish oil,
lard and tallow/greases.
    Oil World's analysis predicted only a slight production
increase of 0.5 mln tonnes in the year to end-September 1987,
compared with increases of 3.6 mln and 4.0 mln tonnes in the
previous two seasons.
    It said world consumption was continuing to rise. Unusually
low prices prevailing since early 1986 had stimulated demand
for both food and non-food purposes, it said.
    World consumption  could increase by a record 2.8 mln
tonnes to 71.8 mln tonnes this season and would be even higher
if the Indian government did not artificially curb domestic
demand.
    Oil World said it did not expect the European Community
(EC) to introduce a vegetable oils tax, but if such a tax were
introduced it would have a negative impact on EC consumption.

Services Inc said it and Staff Buildiers Inc have extended the
term of their merger agreement until May 31.
    Tender Loving Care also said <Norrell Corp> agreed not to
acquire any additional Staff Builders shares until September
30, adding Norrell was paid 750,000 dlrs for the standstill
arrangement. 
    Tender Loving Care said it agreed to buy the 610,000 Staff
Builders common held by Norrell, about 19.1 pct of those
outstanding, for 6,950,000 dlrs immediately prior to the
consummation of the merger.
    Tender Loving Care said the extended merger agreement
continues to provide for the exchange of 1.6 of its shares for
each Staff Builders share outstanding.
    As announced February 26, the Staff Builders shareholders
meeting to vote on the merger, originally convened and
adjourned December 23, will be reconvened on April 22.
    Tender Loving Care said its payment to Norrell will include
1,950,000 dlrs in cash and five mln dlrs of a new series of
eight pct Tender Loving Care convertible preferred.
    Tender Loving Care said it and Staff Builders have filed a
revised registration and proxy statement with the Securities

statement by the commission and its distribution to Staff
Builders' shareholders, that company's management will continue
to solicit proxies for approval of the merger.
    Tender Loving Care said it will have the power to vote
about 15.8 pct of Staff Builders' shares at the adjourned

proxies held by Norrell, which started buying the stock after
the record date for the meeting.
    In addition, Staff Builders officers and directors own
about 13.8 pct of its stock and have agreed to vote in favor of
the merger.
    Accordingly, the vote of an additional 37.1 pct of the

The 1987 outlook for U.S. auto sales is
clouded by a decidedly mixed sales forecast, and analysts who
follow the industry say it is also true for companies that sell
parts and equipment to the major car and truck manufacturers.
    But while there are only four major U.S.-based automakers
whose shares are traded on stock exchanges, there are thousands
of big and small suppliers who sell a flood of original and
replacement parts.
    Analysts who follow the parts industry say there are many
opportunities for investors brought on by the auto industry's
intensified competition and the large volume of production in
North America planned by Japanese automakers.
    But assessing the supplier arena is far more complicated
than for investors considering the stocks of the Detroit Big
Three - General Motors Corp <GM>, Ford Motor Co <F> and
Chrysler Corp <C>.
    Despite widespread predictions that U.S. vehicle sales will
decline about 10 pct from the record 1987 levels, Wall Street
financial experts are still generally bullish on Ford and
somewhat less so on Chrysler.
    And analysts remain largely neutral to bearish on GM, the
industry giant whose earnings have been dropping along with its
sales as it struggles to reorganize and shed its unprofitable
parts-making businesses.

House Ways and Means Committee
Chairman Dan Rostenkowski said he would be reluctant to back
the tax increase if it did not have President Reagan's support.
    He told a National Press Club luncheon there would be a
number of tax proposals that could be debated if Reagan sought
a tax increase to help balance the budget.
    However, he said he would prefer to leave the tax rates
enacted in last year's tax reform bill unchanged.
    There have been calls in Congress to hold the rates at the
1987 level rather than allow them to fall next year.
    Reagan proposed 22 billion dlrs in revenue as part of his
1988 budget proposal, but it did not include general tax
increases.
    On trade issues, Rostenkowski said he did not expect the
major trade bill this year would single out any U.S. industry
for special protection.
    "To go after individual items in a trade bill is suicide,"
he said.
    This apparently ruled out congressional approval of another
textile trade bill to limit quotas on textile imports, as was
proposed again this year.

The deal AMR Corp cut to buy 40 new
planes is a plus for the company because it clearly puts the
financial burden on aircraft manufacturers Boeing Co <BA> and
<Airbus Industrie>, a European consortium, analysts said.
    "The terms put most of the risk on the shoulders of the
manufacturers," said analyst Kevin Murphy of Morgan Stanley and
Co. "They're called walkaway leases."
    AMR agreed to buy 15 planes from Boeing and 25 from Airbus
but said its American Airlines unit will lease the aircraft,
which essentially will be owned by the manufacturers.
    AMR declined to value the deal, which analysts estimated at
roughly 2.4 billion dlrs. American Airlines will use the
planes, scheduled for delivery in 1988 and 1989, to expand its
service in the Caribbean and to Europe.
    But AMR will not lay out cash deposits to pay for the
planes, nor will it take on new debt to finance the purchases.
The carrier has 20-year leases on the aircraft, with four-year
extension options, and may cancel the leases with 30 days
notice by paying a small penalty, according to AMR chairman
Robert Crandall.
    "We're getting the aircraft on very favorable terms,"
Crandall told a press briefing here. He called the deals "off
balance sheet" limited obligation leases, under which the
financing is provided by the manufacturers.
    A spokesman for Airbus confirmed those terms. "We will own
the aircraft and they will be leasing them from us," he said.
Airbus is providing American Airlines with 25 of its twin-jet,
long-range A300-600 planes.
    A spokesman for Boeing Commercial Airplane Co, the unit of
Boeing that makes the long-range 767-300 planes that are part
of the deal, declined to comment on financing arrangements.
    Analysts said "walkaway lease" deals have been used before
by airlines buying aircraft, particularly new generations of
planes, but not to this extent.
    Julius Maldutis of Salomon Brothers Inc said the deal will
give AMR financial stability as it grows. "AMR is using the
manufacturers' balance sheets to finance these airplanes and
consequently, its debt to equity ratio will remain stable into
the early 1990s," he said.
    "The deal reflects a fundamental trend where airlines will
increasingly become operators of assets rather than owners" to
reduce their exposure to risk, he added.

The Federal Savings and Loan
Insurance Corp is facing a deficit because of its potential
liability from insolvent savings associations, the General
Accounting Office told a House Banking hearing.
    "We have preliminarily determined that FSLIC needs to 
establish a contingent liability in the range of eight billion
dlrs to handle cases that will require action in the near
future," Frederick Wolf of the GAO said.
    "When that amount is deducted from FSLIC's reserves, FSLIC
would have a deficit of over three billion dlrs as of the end
of 1986. Clearly, FSLIC needs additional funds to resolve the
large backlog of insolvent and unprofiable savings associations
that continue to operate," Wolf said.
    He urged the committee to support the Treasury Department's
plan to raise 25 billion dlrs over five years to recapitalize
FSLIC.
    Wolf said as of Septmember, 1986, about 85 pct of FSLIC
insured savings associations were solvent, while 15 pct were
insolvent.
    He said 80 pct of savings associations were profitable,
earning a total of 6.9 billion dlrs during the first three
quarters of the year, while the other 20 pct of associations
lost a total of five billion dlrs in the same period.
    The GAO is the investigating agency of Congress.
    Roy Green, president of the Federal Home Loan Bank of
Dallas, estimated his district would need five billion to eight
billion dlrs over the next five years to close 12 Texas savings
associations and 14 associations in nearby states which he said
are considered "hopelessly insolvent".

for its order of 15 Boeing Co <BA> and 25 <Airbus Industrie>
twinjet long distance aircraft.
    But AMR said it was using "rent-a-plane leases" that allow
it to operate the aircraft without adding to its debt
structure. AMR also has the right to decline delivery of the
planes or return them on short notice. The arrangement protects
AMR in the case of an unexpected development such as a severe
downturn in the economy.
    From GE's point of view the package looks like a good deal
for several reasons, Heymann said.
    GE will be able to record revenue as a sale at the time of
delivery, Heymann noted.
    And if for some reason AMR decides not to take the planes
GE's financial arm, General Electric Financial Services Inc,
would have little trouble rounding up another airline that
wanted the fuel efficient planes. On the whole, the deal
appears to pose little risk for GE, Heymann said.
    GE's stock declined 1/4 to 103-1/2 on 625,000 shares by
midafternoon. H.P. Smith, analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham
and Co said for a 40 billion dlr (revenue) company "no one
order will have much of an effect on the stock."
    Russell Leavitt, analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc, said the
order "will help to maintain a good level of production and
profitability in the aircraft engine business" for GE.
    Heymann sees operating profits from GE's jet engine
business rising from 870 mln dlrs last year to 1.3 billion dlrs
by 1991.
    Revenue from jet engines was close to six billion dlrs last
year, with well over half of the business in the military
sector, according to analysts' estimates.
    The rosy outlook for GE's jet engine business coincides
with an upbeat performance in other segments.
    Heymann expects GE to earn 1.39 dlrs per share in the first
quarter of 1987. Saying many will be suprised by the results,
he believes GE has shown through its acquisition of RCA Corp
that it has a "unique ability" to buy a major business and
reshape it, pruning some parts and recombining parts with other
elements of its 14 business areas.
    Smith sees GE earning 1.35 dlrs per share in the current
quarter. He credits good results at RCA, in turn aided by the
NBC broadcasting operation, and lower interest rates.
    Leavitt sees 1.40 dlrs for the current quarter, in part
crediting "significant benefits from the RCA acquisition."

Eastman Kodak Co, best known for its
cameras and film products, took several steps today to boost
its image as a diversified information systems company.
    The Rochester, N.Y.-based company unwrapped a series of new
electronic data and image storage systems that can create vast
computerized libraries of documents and pictures.
    Analysts said Kodak made a good start in the emerging
market for such systems, sales of which are expected to reach
five billion dlrs by 1990. But they warned several years may
pass before the new systems contribute to its bottom line.
    Kodak also launched a 50 mln dlr advertising campaign to
promote its new image. "We want to be to the imaging market
what IBM is to the data processing market," said Edgar J.
Greco, vice president and general manager of Kodak's business
imaging systems division.
    While more than 45 pct of Kodak's 11.55 billion dlrs in
sales for 1986 came from photography products, Kodak said sales
of copiers, electronic storage systems and other business
products will exceed four billion dlrs this year.
    "We're launching a major attack on these new markets,"
Greco said.
    "Kodak perceives that these new businesses will be its
bread and butter," said Wertheim and Co analyst Michael Ellman.
    But Richard Schwarz, who follows Kodak for E.F. Hutton and
Co, said the company will find the profit margins much slimmer
on sophisticated imaging systems than on its consumer
photography products. "The critical problem will be turning a
profit," he said.
     Kodak also announced the first commerically available
14-inch optical disk. Kodak said the disk can store the
equivalent of the contents of 110 file cabinet drawers.

said the structures also provide long life without the need for
rust protection.
    The structure provides the same stiffness and safety as

Assistant Treasury Secretary David
Mulford said he prefers debt conversion plans to help heavily
indebted countries over quick-fix political plans to help ease
their debt burden.
    "In my view, debt conversions or swaps into either equity
or local debt claims provide a preferable route to 'debt
relief' for the debtor nations, particularly if combined with
measures to encourage new equity investment and the
repatriation of flight capital," he told the House Subcommittee
on International Development Institutions.
    Mulford criticized what he called large-scale solutions to
the debt problems effecting many developing countries, ranging
from debt forgiveness to creating new multilateral institutions
for lending.
    "While such approaches may have some political appeal, they
are impractical and ultimately counterproductive," he said.
    He said debt conversions, or swaps, are more effective
because they eliminate the interest service on converted debt,
create new jobs and open up investment opportunities that can
help indebted countries overcome their own problems.

Canadian economic growth is expected to
slow further in 1987, but an improved the trade picture should
keep the country from recession, economists said.
    "The economy is ready for about a 2.0 pct rate of growth
over the course of 1987," said Carl Beigie, Chief Economist at
Dominion Securities Pitfield Ltd.
    Statistics Canada reported that gross domestic product,
grew 3.1 pct in 1986, the fourth year of continuous expansion,
but down from 1985's four pct.
    In the final quarter, GDP, in 1981 prices and at annualized
rates, rose a slight 0.2 pct after expanding 0.8 pct in the
third quarter.
    "Essentially it is a flat performance," said Warren Jestin,
deputy chief economist at the Bank of Nova Scotia.
    Economist Wendy Smith Cork of the brokerage Nesbitt Thomson
Bongard Inc said "it shows the economy is not moving along very
steadily, it's not a very promising number."
    "We weren't surprised, we expected to see one bad quarter
in Canada, but we don't think there will be a recession," she
added.
    The rise in GDP was below the 3.3 pct increase forecast by
Federal Finance Minister Michael Wilson in his budget last
month. He also projected the economy would expand  2.8 pct this
year.
    Many economists are less optimistic, predicting growth will
likely be in the 2.0 to 2.2 pct range.
    Statistics Canada also reported the country's trade
performance deteriorated sharply last year as the deficit in
the current account rose to a record 8.8 billion Canadian dlrs
from the previous year's shortfall of 584 mln dlrs.
    "The sharp increase in the deficit originated from
merchandise trade transactions where imports continued to
advance strongly whereas exports were virtually unchanged," the
federal agency said in a statement.
    The merchandise trade surplus was pared to 10.13 billion
dlrs in 1986 from 17.48 billion dlrs in 1985.
    But economist Cork said the expected upturn in the U.S.
economy will lead to increased demand for Canadian goods, and
help fuel the country's modest expansion. Nearly 80 pct of
Canada's exports are shipped to the U.S. each year.

The Bank of England proposed that banks
in Britain for the first time will have to seek authorization
to be lead underwriters of new issues in the euromarkets.
    In addition, the Bank has proposed limits on the amount of
credit risk that firms can take on with each new issue they
lead manage.
    The proposed rules were outlined today in a consultative
paper on large credit exposures taken by recognized banks and
deposit takers and may be modified, the Bank said.
    The rules could affect billions of dollars of eurobond
securities issued each year. In 1986, about 183 billion dlrs of
new eurobonds were offered, according to figures compiled by
Euromoney magazine.
    Up until now, there have been no restrictions on lead
managing eurobond issues.
    However, eurobond market participants believe the Bank of
England is concerned about intense competition for market share
which may have caused some firms to expose themselves to
imprudent credit risk.
    Competition for market share has been a boon to issuers as
banks compete to offer the best terms. But the new rules
suggest that some constraints may be placed on competition as
regulators attempt to ensure that no bank takes on more risk
than it can handle. Banking sources said that while the Bank of
England is reluctant to inhibit competition, it is willing to
accept some constraints in order to ensure that underwriters
act prudently.
    "The Bank's assessment of the appropriateness of a bank's
lead underwriting activity will depend primarily upon the skill
and experience of the lead underwriter in the particular market
concerned...," the Bank's proposal said.
    Once a firm has received permission to act as lead
underwriter, the exposure will be valued at one-sixth of the
face amount of the securities. Nominal exposure exceeding 60
pct of capital must be reported to the Bank of England and it
must be notified in advance for exposure of over 150 pct of
capital.
    The exposure will be determined to exist for a maximum of
28 days following a binding commitment to underwrite. After
that, any remaining exposure from unsold securities will be
assessed at their full face value.
    The rules would not apply to syndicated loan facilities,
revolving credits or commercial paper, the Bank said.
    The Bank also amended other aspects of plans to strengthen
its supervisory powers over banks in the paper, which called
for comments from professionals by March 31 to allow their
possible inclusion in the Banking Bill in time for its planned
final discussion in Parliament, scheduled before summer.
    The new Banking Bill, updating the 1979 Banking Act, is the
third leg of the Conservative government's legislation for the
supervision of financial institutions.
    It is to feature alongside the Financial Services Act,
aimed to bolster investor protection, and the Building
Societies Act, which put these institutions on an equal footing
with banks.
    The proposed legislation would abolish distinctions between
recognised banks and licensed deposit-takers and tighten legal
controls, making it a criminal offence to mislead supervisors.
    Proposals to require banks to inform the Bank of England in
advance of planned exposures in excess of 25 pct of their
capital, and to have the Bank supervise exposures between 10
and 25 pct of capital, were not under debate, the paper showed.
    However, preliminary consultations with bank
representatives had shown some of the initial proposals to be
flawed, it said.
    Most proposed changes involved evaluating exposures on a
case-by-case basis rather than along general lines.
    Amendments involved the Bank's proposed treatment of
exposures by financial institutions acting as banker to other
units of their own group of companies, the paper showed.
    They also regarded the treatment of credit exposure to
local governments and other public sector entities, and of
exposures undertaken by banks that are subsidiaries of banks.
    Proposals on how to value securities given by a debtor as
collateral to a credit were slightly changed, the paper showed.
    Exposures taken on by banks acting as creditor within their
own group of companies would usually be looked into on a
case-by-case basis under new proposals, it said.
    The paper said exposures to state-owned industries and
other public sector authorities in the U.K. and abroad should
be given the more lenient treatment of credits to governments
provided a government gives unconditional repayment guarantees.
    It cautioned that exposures to U.K. local authorities and
those guaranteed by the British Export Credit Guarantee
Department would probably not qualify for such treatment.
    On credits granted by banks which are a subsidiary of
another bank, an earlier-proposed 100 pct of capital ceiling
could be exceeded in individual cases.
    But the parent bank would have to give a formal undertaking
to take over the exposure if problems were to occur, and state
in writing that the exposure was retained in the subsidiary's
balance sheet to meet precise group objectives, the paper said.
    On collateral security, it said this "should normally only
be taken into account when considering the acceptability of a
bank's exposure up to 25 pct of its capital base."
    "The presence of security taken on its own will be
considered by the Bank as an acceptable reason for an exposure
in excess of 25 pct, but only in the most exceptional
circumstances and even then to a very limited extent," it said.

The chairman of Goodyear Tire and Rubber
Co, a concern that survived a recent hostile takeover bid,
charged that "terrorists in three-piece suits" are undermining
the nation's industrial base.
In a speech to a meeting of south Florida business executives,
Goodyear Chairman Robert Mercer lashed out at corporate raiders
and takeover specialists, accusing them of causing serious harm
to the companies they target.
  "Their interest is not in preserving and strengthening
America's industrial and providing jobs," he said. "Their
product is simply deals, and that is not a product which a
country ... can base a future on."
    Last year, Mercer fought off a takeover attempt by British
industrialist Sir James Goldsmith.
    But Goodyear's independence was preserved at a high price,
Mercer said.
    The company bought back Goldsmith's stock for 620 mln dlrs,
giving him a 93 mln dlr profit. Goodyear also paid him 37 mln
dlrs for expenses and bought about 41 mln other shares for over
two billion dlrs.
    In an effort to trim its new debt, Goodyear closed down
three plants Mercer believes otherwise could have been saved,
sold its motor wheel and aerospace units and reduced its
payroll by 10 pct, he said.
    Mercer, who plans to testify tomorrow at a Senate hearing
on a proposed bill to control corporate raiders, said hostile
takeovers have also hurt workers.

General Motors Corp said its directors
authorized the repurchase of up to 20 pct of its 1.66 dlr par
value common stock by the end of 1990.
    GM said the level of repurchases this year will not exceed
10 mln shares or about three pct of its outstanding stock.
    It said the stock repurchase, as market conditions permit,
will be funded from a portion of the cash flows generated by
reduced capital spending and anticipated performance
improvements.
    GM also said its board authorized the repurchase of as many
as five mln shares each of its class E and class H common, with
about half of the proposed repurchases completed by year end.
    GM also said it is considering offering an odd-lot
repurchase program for its class H stock by mid-year.
    GM said the class E and H repurchases would increase
participation in the net income of its Electronic Data Systems
Corp <GME> and Hughes Electronic Corp <GMH> subsidiaries by
holders of its 1.66 dlr par value common.
    GM also said it anticipates a decrease in automotive
capital spending, excluding EDS and Hughes Aircraft Co, to 7.9
billion dlrs in 1987 and 5.8 billion dlrs in 1989, from 10.6
billion dlrs in 1986.
    It also said improvements in operating performance are
expected to amount to 10 billion dlrs annually by 1990.
    "We have one overriding objective--to position GM so that
it is producing the best products available in an increasingly
competitive global marketplace," said Chairman Roger B. Smith.
    GM had 319.4 mln shares of its 1.66 dlr par value common
outstanding, 53.5 mln shares of class E and 66.6 mln shares of
class H outstanding at year end 1986.
    GM said that its par value holders currently participate in
the 56 pct of the earnings of EDS and 67 pct of Hughes'
earnings.
    GM also said it will continue to repurchase shares of all
three classes of its common in connection with ongoing
requirements of various benefit plans.

of 1.66 dlr par value common and 2.5 mln shares each of class E

The U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee
may take up a bill tomorrow that would strengthen the
activities of U.S. agricultural trade teams in selected
developing countries, committee staff said.
    The measure, sponsored by committee Chairman Patrick Leahy
(D-Vt.) and Sen. John Melcher (D-Mont.), would establish trade
teams of between six and nine persons drawn from federal
agencies and private voluntary organizations, staff said.
    The trade missions would seek to generate interest in the
U.S. government's food donation and commercial programs --
PL480, Section 416, export credit and export enhancement -- and
upon return be required to advocate extension of concessional
or commercial benefits to interested countries.
    The trade teams would be made up of representatives of the
U.S. Agriculture Department, State Department, the Agency for
International Development and private voluntary organizations
such as U.S. Wheat Associates.
    The bill would require teams within six months to visit
seven countries: Mexico, Philippines, Indonesia, India,
Bangladesh, Senegal and Nigeria.
    Within one year after passage of the measure, another eight
countries would have to be visited: Peru, Kenya, the Dominican
Republic, Costa Rica, Malaysia, Venezuela, Tunisia and Morocco.
Other countries could be added to the list.
    Senate staff members said the bill, still in the drafting
stages, had broad support and was expected to be approved by
the committee tomorrow.

Total supply of frozen concentrated
orange juice (FCOJ) in 1986/87 is expected to be significantly
above year-earlier levels, even with carry-in stocks well below
the previous season, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.
    In a summary of its Fruit Situation Report, the Department
said Florida's imports of FCOJ, mostly from Brazil, have shown
sharp gains to date.
    The Department noted the price of FCOJ will probably be
affected by the final decision, scheduled for April 22, on
whether the U.S. considers Brazilian FCOJ exports to the U.S.
have caused injury.
    Continuing strong demand for fresh and processing fruit
coupled with seasonal declines in supplies mean that grower
prices will remain higher this spring than a year earlier.
    The department said stocks of fresh apples in cold storage
at the beginning of February were moderately larger than a year
earlier, but strong demand has kept apple prices firm.
    In view of the strong demand and seasonally reduced
supplies, apple prices are projected to stay firm.
    During the remainder of 1986/87, supplies of most processed
noncitrus fruit will be smaller than a year ago, it said.
    Movement of canned fruit has improved, and remaining
suppies for some canned fruit items are tight and as a
consequence prices have strengthened, the department said.

House Ways and Means Committee
chairman Dan Rostenkowski would want White House support for
any tax increase, including a tax on securities transactions,
before considering the issue, a staff member said.
    In addition, congressional leaders have not agreed on
whether they will seek any tax increase this year, he said.
    Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat whose committee is in
charge of tax legislation, met this afternoon with House
Speaker Jim Wright, a Texas Democrat, to discuss a variety of
tax and budget issues, an aide said. He added that Wright did
not endorse the securities transfer tax but raised it yesterday
as a possible way to cut the federal deficit.
    The aide to Wright added that Wright asked the Ways and
Means Committee to look into the securities transfer tax.
However, he said Wright had not recommended it as he had
another tax proposal to hold income tax rates at the 1987 level
rather than allow the 1987 tax rate cut to take place.
    Wright brought up a 0.5 pct tax on all sales and purchases
of publicly traded securities as a way to raise about 17
billion dlrs a year, the aide said.
    The New York Stock Exchange said it had not seen the
proposal by the House Speaker but added that it is "strongly
opposed to any proposal to impose a transfer tax on securities
transactions."
    NYSE vice president Richard Torrenzano said in a statement,
"Such a tax would be paid by millions of investors nationwide
and would be counter-productive, making America's securities
industry vulnerable to foreign competition at a time
when financial markets are becoming increasingly
international."

Eligible producers of 1986 crop U.S.
corn and sorghum will receive an estimated 600 mln dlrs in
deficiency payments -- 50 pct in generic commodity certificates
and 50 pct in cash, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.
    It said corn producers will receive about 515 mln dlrs and
sorghum producers about 85 mln dlrs.
    Only the cash portion of the payments will be subject to
the 4.3 pct reduction in compliance with the Gramm-Rudman
budget deficit control act of 1985, it said.
    Corn and sorghum producers who requested advance deficiency
payments have already received about 2.8 billion dlrs and 225
mln dlrs, respectively, USDA said.
    The Department said deficiency payment rates of 51.5 cents
per bushel for corn and 49 cents per bushel for sorghum were
received by producers requesting advance payments.
    Deficiency payments are calculated as the difference
between an established target price and the higher of the basic
loan rate, or the national average price received by farmers
during the first five months of the marketing year --
September-January.
    National weighted average market prices for the first five
months of the season were 1.46 dlrs per bushel for corn and
1.33 dlrs per bushel for sorghum. Eligible corn producers will
be paid 63 cts per bushel, based on the difference between the
3.03 target price and the 2.40 dlr per bushel basic loan rate.
    Sorghum producers' deficiency payment rate will be 60 cents
per bushel, based on the difference between the 2.88 dlrs per
bushel target price and the 2.28 dlrs per bushel basic loan
rate.
    The deficiency payment rates for both commodities are the
maximum permitted by law, the department said.
    Eligible corn and sorghum producers will receive another
1986 crop deficiency payment in October if the national average
market prices received by farmers during the entire marketing
year for both commodities are below the basic loan rates, the
department said.
    The payments will be issued through local Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service offices, it said.

Pennzoil Co chairman J. Hugh Liedtke
said the company has made several proposals to Texaco Inc <TX> 
to settle a 9.13 billion dlr judgment awarded to Pennzoil and
that a settlement was "in the best interests of both
companies."
    Liedtke, in a letter mailed today to Pennzoil shareholders,
said Texaco's management has incorrectly implied in recent
public statements that Pennzoil was not interested in settling
the case.
    "Pennzoil has made Texaco several proposals, both before
and after trial, to settle this dispute," Liedtke said in the
letter. "We do not know why Texaco's officials would now make
such clearly untrue statements."
    Last month, a Texas state appeals court upheld a jury
judgment that Texaco illegally interfered with Pennzoil's plan
to acquire Getty Oil in 1983. The appeals court reduced by two
billion dlrs the original 10.53 billion dlrs in damages awarded
to Pennzoil, but interest accruing on the award has pushed the
total amount back above 10 billion dlrs.
    Pennzoil said that Texaco had made four unsatisfactory
proposals to settle the billion-dollar lawsuit.
    "Other than to put on the record that it has made offers,
Texaco's proposals make no sense," Liedtke said in the letter.
"In fact, two of Texaco's offers were identical and were
proposals that Texaco knew in advance Pennzoil would not
accept."
    The letter did not disclose terms of settlement offers made
by either Pennzoil or Texaco.
    "If and when Texaco's management changes its position and
demonstrates a willingness to make a good faith attempt to
settle this matter, Pennzoil will make every effort to
cooperate," Liedtke said. "Such a solution, I believe, is
clearly in the interests of both companies, even if it not
attractive, as a personal matter, to Texaco's management and
directors."
    Liedtke said that cash flow from the Getty Oil assets and
profits from those assets that have since been sold
"approximately equaled" Texaco's purchase price of 10 billion
dlrs for Getty.

Hilton Hotels Corp said it received
approval from Federal court to sue the Internal Revenue Service
to determine if the IRS was correct in allowing the Conrad
Hilton Foundation to hold certain stocks.
    That ruling by the IRS allowed the Foundation, set up by
the late Conrad Hilton, to hold onto 27 pct of the Hilton Corp,
worth approximately 164 mln dlrs, according to Hilton
attorneys.
    Barron Hilton, Conrad's son, is making a bid to purchase
those 6,782,000 shares, the company said.
    However, in an effort to hold onto the stock, the
Foundation changed its tax status from a private foundation to
a public support organization, freeing it from the constraints
of the excess business holdings limitations imposed on private
foundations by the Tax Reform Act of 1969, according to the
Hilton Corp.
    That act said that a private foundation could not own more
than 20 pct of a corporation, lawyers explained. Anything over
that figure had to be sold.
    The lawyers explained that when Conrad Hilton died, the law
required that excess holdings by the Foundation above 20 pct of
the common stock should be sold. Under Conrad Hilton's will,
Barron had the option to buy the seven pct,  according to the
Hilton lawyers.
    Now Hilton lawyers contend that through a clause in the tax
law, Barron Hilton is entitled to buy the entire 27 pct block
of stock. The Hilton lawyers explained that Barron was
attempting to keep the large block from going public, leaving
the family in control of the corporation.

ITT Corp Chairman Rand Araskog told a
meeting of analysts that the company has been considering a
repurchase of some shares.
    "We are considering that as a very important way to
increase earnings per share," Araskog said and noted the aim
was not to boost ITT's stock short term in the market.
    ITT recently reported that its 1986 earnings from
operations rose to 3.45 dlrs per share from 1.80 dlrs per share
a year ago.
    Araskog said its preferred issues were among the shares
being studied for repurchase.
    "We look forward to a strong 1987 and a stronger 1988,"
Araskog told the analysts. "We have more confidence...than any
other time in our history - at least with me."
    Araskog took over as chairman of ITT in 1979 and since then
has sold many of the diversified businesses that were acquired
by former chairman Harold Geneen in the 1960s and 1970s.
   Last year, the company transferred its European
telecommunications businesses into a joint venture with Cie
Generale d'Electricite, called Alcatel N.V.
    ITT retained a 37 pct interest in the venture.
    Although the agreement was closed by the end of the year,
Araskog said the final transfers of stock of a number of small
companies was recently concluded.
    "We really wrapped everything up," he said adding that the
company had received an additional 113 mln dlrs from the stock
transfers.
    Araskog said the company received all the cash due from the
Alcatel venture except for 400 mln dlrs in intercompany
receiveables, which should be paid by the end of March.
    Araskog had told analysts last July that the company was
considering repurchasing some shares, but a spokesman noted
that ITT found it difficult to undertake the program because of
the sharp appreciation in its stock price.
   
    Breaking out operating earnings by divisions, ITT said
diversified services, which consists of insurance, financial
services, communications and hotels, saw the sharpest rise in
operating income, to 454 mln dlrs, from 297 mln dlrs a year
ago.
    Industrial and defense operating income declined 48 mln
dlrs, to 315 mln dlrs, while natural resources increased 10 mln
dlrs, to 73 mln dlrs, the company said.

Chicago Board of trade grain traders and
analysts voiced a lot of interest in how farmers planned to
handle their upcoming spring plantings, prompting sales of new
crop months of corn and oats and purchases in new crop soybeans
in the futures markets.
    Professionals in the grains trade think that farmers will
be more willing to stick with corn acres than soybeans because
corn is protected by the acreage reduction program. That gives
deficiency payments to farmers if corn prices stay low.
    Farmers can place soybeans under the loan program if they
sign-up for reduced acreage, but they have no price guarantees.
    With the price outlook for both commodities so dismal,
traders believe farmers will want to stick with a sure thing
rather than gamble on soybeans, even though the new crop
soybean/corn ratio of 2.9/1 would make planting soybeans more
attractive under normal circumstances.
    An announcement late Friday that the USDA will lift the
limited cross-compliance requirement for the 1987 oats crop,
means farmers will be able plant an estimated two to three mln
more oat acres this year than last without being penalized,
traders said.
    Here too, acres some farmers may have been thinking of
shifting to soybeans will now be planted with oats, due to the
more attractive deal from the government, they added.
    Cotton prices are almost twice what they were just six
months ago, which should prompt many farmers in the South to
put soybean land back into cotton.
    One of the reasons for the steady increase in soybean
production in recent years has been a general shift of acres in
traditional cotton producing regions of the South to soybeans,
which are easier to grow, one commercial trader said.

The Senate Agriculture Committee is
expected to take up a bill tomorrow that would exempt from
government conservation regulations those farmers who have
rotated alfalfa and other multiyear grasses and legumes with
row crops, committee staff said.
    Under current so-called "sodbuster" law, farmers who planted
alfalfa and other multiyear grasses and legumes on highly
erodible land in the years 1981 through 1985 lose federal farm
program benefits if they produce a row crop on that land in
later years.
    Sen. Edward Zorinsky (D-Neb.), sponsor of the measure, said
recently that those crop rotating practices resulted in less
erosion than the practices of many farmers who produced
strictly row crops.

Wall Street analysts said a share
repurchase program announced by General Motors Corp is in part
an attempt to placate shareholders angry over the recent
repurchase of shares from Texan H. Ross Perot last year.
    "He (Perot) was obviously the big trigger" said analyst
Joseph Phillippi of E.F. Hutton Co. "There was a firestorm of
criticism from people on the institutional side."
    Wall Street analysts said the GM buyback will boost the
shares in the near term but some had reservations about the
long term effects of the plan.
    "They're trying to soothe irate shareholders irriated by
the buyout of Ross Perot," said analyst David Healy of Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc.
    Healy said General Motors chairman Roger Smith had been
hinting at a buyback program in meetings with institutional
investors. He said the plan, which could cost more than five
billion dlrs over four years, was similar in size to Ford Motor
Co's <F> repurchase program but smaller on a percentage basis
than that of Chrysler Corp <C>.
    Healy said General Motors will have to borrow money to buy
back stock on a large scale.
    The General Motors plan, announced after a board of
directors meeting in New York, calls for repurchase of up to 20
pct of the common stock by the end of 1990.
    The GM board also authorized repurchase of up to five mln
class E <GME> and class H <GMH> shares. GM shares closed at
75-5/8, up 7/8, in composite trading prior to the company's
announcement. However subsequently Jefferies and Co, which
trades NYSE-listed issues outside regular hours, said it was
making a market in the shares at 77-1/2 to 78.
    "The stock is obviously going to be strong tomorrow," said
Ronald Glantz, analyst at Montgomery Securities.
    "I don't know where the money (for the buyback) is coming
from unless they borrow," Glantz said. "Their credit rating is
going to fall." GM said it anticipates a decrease in automotive
capital spending.
    Glantz believes GM could be inviting a strike this fall by
going ahead with the buyback program at a time when it has
37,000 employees on indefinite layoff and 11 plants marked for
closing. After deciding against a profit sharing bonus for
workers and buying out Perot for 743 mln dlrs "this will be
seen as rubbing salt into the wound," Glantz said. "GM must be
challenging the union to make it the strike target."
    Glantz said he is not changing his buy recommendation on GM
and expects the shares to rise. But he said he did not think
the overall plan was "prudent."
    "Obviously we're going to get at least an opening gap in
the stock tomorrow," Hutton's Phillippi said.
    He says GM apparently believes as a result of a cost
reduction program plus the falloff in capital spending levels
"they can handle a stock buyback of this magnitude within the
confines of their cash flow." Phillippi, who has been telling
clients to hold GM shares mainly for income, said on balance
"we've got to feel they're doing something constructive."

<British Columbia
Resources Investment Corp>, earlier reporting higher full year
operating losses, said it reached agreement in principle with
five lenders providing for a 360 mln dlr credit facility over a
four year term.
    The company said the credit facility is extendable under
certain circumstances, with annual principal payments of five
mln dlrs. The agreement is subject to certain lender approvals
and completion of formal documentation.
    It earlier reported 1986 losses before extraordinary items
rose to 26.4 mln dlrs from year-ago 7.2 mln dlrs.
    B.C. Resources also said dividends on its series 2
preferred shares and exchangeable preferred shares will remain
suspended.
    However, payment will be made on account of the quarterly
dividend on the exchangeable preferred shares by the company's
trustee from a deposit account, B.C. Resources said.
    Sufficient funds should be available to pay full amount of
the March 31, 1987 dividend to exchangeable preferred
shareholders, with payment expected in early April to
shareholders of record March 31, the company said.
    If future dividends are not declared after the April
exchangeable preferred quarterly payout, future payment will
depend on the amount of dividends received from Westcoast
Transmission Co <WTC>, B.C. Resources said.
    The company said its increased fourth quarter and full year
operating losses primarily resulted from lower oil prices and a
four month labor shutdown at its Balmer coal mine in British
Columbia.
    B.C. Resources also recorded a 99.9 mln dlr extraordinary
loss, which included losses on disposition of North Sea oil and
gas interests by 67 pct owned <Westar Mining Ltd>.
    B.C. Resources' 1986 extraordinary charge also included a
writedown of its investment in Westar Petroleum. Gains on the
sales of Westar Timber's Skeena and Celgar pulp mills and
Terrace sawmill partially offset the extraordinary loss, the
company said.
    The company said the asset sales have eliminated B.C.
Resources' long term financing commitment in the North Sea and
exposure to the fluctuating pulp market.
    It also said it cut long term debt in 1986 to 900 mln dlrs
from 1.3 billion dlrs at year-end 1985, and management changes
and staff cuts have significantly reduced costs.

Williams Cos said a fourth quarter charge
of 250 mln dlrs from discontinued operations and writedowns
contributed to a 1986 net loss of 240 mln dlrs or 6.97 dlrs a
share against earnings of 31.6 mln dlrs or 92 cts in 1985.
    The loss in the quarter was 232.3 mln dlrs or 6.75 dlrs
against income of 10.7 mln dlrs or 31 cts a year ago. Revenues
in the quarter fell to 521.1 mln dlrs from 716.9 mln and in the
year fell to 1.9 billion dlrs from 2.5 billion in 1985.
    Williams also said the previously announced sale of its
Agrico Chemical Co unit to Freeport-Mcmoran Resource Partners
Ltd has cleared antitrust review and should close next week.
    The 1987 first quarter will include proceeds from the
Agrico sale, for 250 mln dlrs cash at closing plus deferred
payments, and proceeds of 320 mln dlrs from the sale of a stake
in Peabody Holding Co, completed in January.
    In the 1986 first quarter, Williams reported net of 14.2
mln dlrs or 41 cts a share on sales of 796.4 mln dlrs.
    Williams said the charges in the current year were related
to an ongoing restructuring. The company said the restructuring
moves had improved its balance sheet and improved the outlook
for future stability and growth in earnings.
    Operating profit at the company's Northwest Pipeline Corp
unit fell 4.5 pct to 150 mln dlrs from lower sales. The
Williams Natural Gas unit had operating profit of 50.5 mln dlrs
compared to 90.9 mln dlrs on lower sales volumes.
    Profit at Williams Gas Marketing rose to 26 mln dlrs from
about 22 mln and the William Pipe Line Co had operating profit
of 49.4 mln dlrs versus 63.6 mln dlrs a year ago.

billion. Credit volume eased to 9.1 billion from 9.2 billion
while loans to companies rose seven pct.

increased. Higher earnings from trading on the bank's own

Public Service Co of New
Mexico said it is evaluating placing its electric distribution
system in a limited partnership with assets of about 400 mln
dlrs.
    The utility said it advised a customer task force this is
one restructuring alternative being considered for the
company's electric business.
    The structure is being evaluated as part of the company's
overall initiative in response to several goals announced by
New Mexico Governor Garrey Carruthers, it explained.
    Public Service New Mexico said a central feature of its
reorganization concept would be to separate the company's
electric utility operation into independent generation and
distribution entities, creating the opportunity for a targeted
35 mln dlr a year rate decrease.
    Noting the use of the limited partnership structure by a
variety of businesses recently, the company said it believes
"the concept may well have an application in the utility
business and intend to investigate it fully."
    The generation company would provide projected power needs
of the distribution entity under a 30-year "power security
agreement" which would have a federally regulated rate
structure, the company said.
    Public Service New Mexico said the restructuring could
provide for its gas and water utilities and its non-utility
companies becoming subsidaries of the proposed holding company
approved by the company's shareholders in May 1986.
    This holding company would be the general partner of the
limited partnership, the company said.
    The company said its limited partnership concept was
presented to an ad hoc customer task force convened by Gov.
Carruthers to review the company's reorganization proposals.
    It said the reorganization and limited partnership are an
alternative structure that would  help reduce rates through a
lower overall cost of capital.
    Last month the governor said "I have outlined to PNM
critical goals which I have asked them to cooperate with may
administration in achieving" adding the goals include immediate
rate reduction, stabilization of future rates and stimulation
of business expansion.
    The company told the task force the new distribution
company, under the limited partnership alternative or
otherwise, would continue to be fully regulated by state
regulators.
    PNM's proposed generation company would continue to be
owned by common shareholders through the holding company. Its
rates would be set by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
which regulates for wholesale electric power sales and
transmission services. The generation company would have no
retail customers.
    PNM said it expects to file a detailed restructuring plan
with state regulators in the near future, noting approval would
also be needed by FERC.

A one billion stg issue of nine pct
Exchequer stock due 2002 which became available for trading
only this morning was exhausted in mid-afternoon trading on the
U.K. Government bond market, dealers said.
    The Bank of England said the issue was no longer operating
as a tap. The issue was announced Monday at a price of 96 stg
pct and dealers said the Government broker's supplies were sold
out this afternoon at a partly-paid 20-20/32 stg pct. The bonds
started trading this morning at 20 stg pct.
    Dealers noted the market had seen vigorous demand
throughout the day, prompted mainly by sterling strength.
    Dealers said that demand had been seen for the tap from
both domestic and overseas sources, including from Japan and
the U.S.
    Although the issue had not been designated as free of tax
to residents abroad (FOTRA) widespread bullish sentiment for
the market in general had generated foreign buying.
    The stock had been regarded as slightly expensive when it
was announced and dealers said that even first thing this
morning it had seemed slightly dear in relation to comparable
existing stocks.
    However, sterling's continuing firm performance had
prompted interest in the tap right at the outset.
    The issue's value had been enhanced by its partly-paid
structure, which not only enabled investors to defer payment of
the major part of the price until April 27, but also conferred
a substantial gearing element.
    This meant, dealers explained, that investors who bought
the bonds benefitted fully from price gains registered by the
market in general, although only 20 stg pct of the total
purchase price was tied up initially.

the Japanese and the Germans have cut their profit margins to

much the same.

The Bundesbank is planning changes in
the system by which banks bid for funds in securities
repurchase pacts to improve the flexibility of its key open
market instrument, central bank officials said.
    Banking economists said the changes will shorten the tender
process to two days from three currently, enabling the
Bundesbank to offer repurchase pacts of shorter maturity if it
chooses, to steer money market liquidity more flexibly.
    The changes will probably come into force in April.
    Under the current system, banks must themselves specify at
the tender which securities they will sell to the Bundesbank
for subsequent repurchase, a time consuming business.
    Banks hold securities for this purpose in safe custody
accounts in the Landeszentralbank (LZB) regional central banks,
which are the local offices of the Bundesbank at state level.
    Some 50 billion marks of securities are held in such
accounts at the Hesse LZB, which covers the Frankfurt area.
    The change to come into force next month will allow the
Bundesbank access to these accounts to select the bonds itself,
in a process legally comparable to direct debiting.
    At present the Bundesbank generally announces a tender on
Monday, holds the tender late on Tuesday morning, announces the
result early Tuesday afternoon and allocates funds Wednesday.
    The Bundesbank generally sets repurchase pacts running 28
days. But sometimes public holidays result in longer pacts or
longer tender periods being necessary.
    For instance the Bundesbank announced a tender last Friday
to be held today (Wednesday) for crediting funds tomorrow
(Thursday). The advance announcement took into account the
carnival holiday in Duesseldorf on Monday and in Frankfurt
yesterday (Tuesday).
    Central bank officials and money market dealers said the
shortening of the tender process should be seen as purely
technical, with no direct implications for interest rates.
    "It is not a credit policy matter but a technical matter,"
said an official at the Hesse LZB.
    Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said last December
that security repurchase pacts had proved a much greater
success since their introduction in their present form two
years ago, and praised their flexibility.
    The tender process changes will make the repurchase pact
instrument even more flexible, banking economists said.
    By speeding up the tender process, they will make it
possible for the Bundesbank to offer repurchase pacts for
periods of less than a month, something long sought by banks,
to respond to changing money market conditions.
    "With the help of this instrument liquidity steering will be
refined, but there won't be any effect on interest rates," said
Berliner Handels- und Frankfurter Bank economist Hermann
Remsperger.
    The Bundesbank would be able to react more quickly to money
market developments, but by steering liquidity, not interest
rates, he said.

The cost of living in West Germany will
likely be about 0.5 pct higher on average in 1987 than in 1986,
when the cost of living actually fell by an average 0.2 pct in
the first recurrence of "negative inflation" since the 1950s, the
HWWA economic research institute said.
    The re-emergence of inflation will result mainly from the
fading of two factors which influenced the fall in the 1986
cost of living - the steep decline in both oil prices and the
value of the dollar, the institute said in a report.
    The institute said inflation will see a rising trend in the
course of 1987, but will average only 0.5 pct for the year as a
whole because year on year rates will remain negative in the
first part of 1987.
    Provisional inflation figures for February released last
week showed the cost of living last month was 0.5 pct lower
than in February 1986. In January prices had fallen 0.8 pct
against the same month a year earlier.
    The HWWA said its forecast assumed the dollar would remain
around 1.80 marks and oil prices would range between 15 and 17
dlrs per barrel.

National Fuel Gas Co said it has

    The proposal calls for National Fuel's Seneca Resources

and undeveloped oil and gas assets in return for refinancing
Argo's debt to Seneca.
    The plan calls for Seneca to made an additional 500,000 dlr
advance to Argo, National Fuel Gas said.
    National Fuel Gas said it reorganzation was proposed in a
term sheet signed by Seneca, Argo and representatives of Argo's
unsecured creditors committee. Seneca became Argo's principal
secured creditor in November when it purchased notes totaling
about 40 mln dlrs from Continental Illinois National Bank and
Trust Co for about 35 mln dlrs.
    National Fuel Gas said the additional advance to Argo would
allow it to capitalize, together with other assets, a new
company for its existing shareholders.
    National Fuel Gas said the plan calls for Argo's existing
secured debt to be refinanced in an 8,875,000 dlr refinancing
note and a 75 pct interest in Argo's principal oil and gas
properties.
    Seneca and Argo will enter into a venture to be 75 pct
owned by Seneca and 25 pct by Argo to develop their jointly
owned properties.
    In addition to restructuring and refinancing Argo's
existing debt, Seneca will provide Argo with a two mln dlr
revolving line of credit to finance its 25 pct share of the
venture's development costs, National Fuel Gas said.
    It said the proposed plan calls for Argo oil and gas assets
not subject to the venture to be transferred to a new
corporation. Existing Argo shareholders will receive all the
new company's common stock while its unsecured creditors will
receive 100 pct of the new capital stock of Argo in exchange
for their claims against the company.

Consolidated Edison Co of New York Inc

    He told a press conference the 132.5 mln dlr reduction in
annual rates, along with the removal of 50 mln dlrs in fuel
charges from base rates are part of an agreement which will
reduce the utility's base electric rates by about 500 mln dlrs
per year over the next three years and bar any rate increases
until at least April 1990.
    Governor Cuomo said the agreement with Con Ed, which must
be approved by the State Public Service Commission, was
negotiated by the State Consumer Protection Board, Public
Servcice commission Trial Staff, the State Attorney General,
the City of New York and several other parties.
    He said the agreement "will produce the first base eldctric
rate decrease for Con Edison in more than 20 years.
    As a result of an earlier stipulation, we have already had
a four year freeze on Con Edison's base electric rates since
March 1983," he added.
    Con Edison said the agreement reflects reduced federal
taxes and lower interest rates.
    The utility said another factor includes improved economic
conditions in the New York City area, which led to increased
sales.
    It pointed out "declining fuel costs have resulted in an
average 10 pct decrease in our customers' bills since 1984."

International Business
Machines Corp said it demonstrated an experimental computer
chip called an opto-electronic receiver that transforms light
into electrical signals that translate into computer language.
    IBM said the chip is two times faster than any similar chip
reported and can read 40 encyclopedia volumes a second.
    The chip is made of gallium arsenide which moves electrical
signals faster than the silicon used in most computer circuits.
    IBM also said that since gallium arsenide is more efficient
in turning light signals into electrical signals, it seems to
be an ideal material for the light-based computer
communications expected to be widely used in the future.
    The chip's speed is also enhanced through the elimination
of wiring by placing the functionally dissimilar photodetector
and transistor circuitry close together.
    Bringing these elements closer together also isolates the
receiver from other electronic circuits and reduces noise and
distortion, it said.

Drilling for oil in California is
likely to continue at last year's sharply reduced levels
despite recent gains in crude oil prices, industry analysts
said.
    Because much of the crude oil in California fields is
thick, heavy and expensive to extract, oil prices would have to
increase to near 1985's levels before any significant recovery
is seen in drilling, they said.
    "Companies will probably only drill their best prospects,"
said John Curti, an analyst with Birr Wilson Securities Inc.
    Few new wells now are being drilled.
    Only 33 rigs, about one-quarter of the total available,
were drilling for oil onshore in California last week, compared
to about 70 last year, said Bill Bolster of Munger Oil
Information Services, which tracks California drilling
activity.
    "It's in the dregs right now," said Bolster of the state's
drilling activity.
    Current prices are not enough to justify increased
drilling, said Ed Malmgreen of the California Independent
Producers Association.
    While an Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries pact
to curb production boosted oil prices early this year, prices
eventually fell.
    Prices for California's marker grade, Line 63 blend, have
slumped about 20 pct in the last month to 14 dlrs from a high
of about 17 dlrs.
    More than half of California's oil comes from stripper
wells, those producing less than 10 barrels a day, and that
much of that oil costs between 18 and 25 dlrs a barrel to
extract, Malmgreen said.
    "It's not unusual for a stripper well to cost 18 dlrs,"
Malmgreen said.
    Many stripper wells along the southern California coast
produce eight times as much water as crude oil, and inland
wells frequently require the use of steam injection to spur
extraction of the thick, heavy oil, he said.
    The outlook for future production in California is clouded
by a lack of exploratory drilling now, analysts said.
    In the heart of California's oil patch, Kern County, which
produces about two-thirds of the state's oil, exploratory
drilling has slowed to a crawl.
    Only 55 exploratory wells were drilled in Kern County in
1986, compared to 137 in 1985, according to David Mitchell of
the state energy commission. So far this year only five
exploratory wells have been drilled.
    "I don't think they'll even get to what they did last
year," Mitchell said.
    No pickup in exploratory drilling is likely for the rest of
the decade, Mitchell said.
    Along with the fall in drilling has come a decrease in the
number of producing wells and overall production.
    Between February and October of 1986, the number of
producing oil wells in California fell 14 pct to 43,521 from
more than 50,000, said Bill Guerard of the California Energy
Commission.
    In line with that decrease, California's crude oil output
fell about 10 pct last year due to low oil prices and is
expected to remain at that lower level, analysts said.
    Between February and October 1986, California's crude oil
production slipped from an all-time high of 1.185 mln barrels
per day to 1.066 mln bpd, Guerard said.
    Total estimated crude oil production in California for 1986
was 408 mln bbls, compared with 424 mln bbls in 1985 and 405
mln bbl in 1983, according to the California Department of
Conservation.
    "Production in 1987 will probably hold around 1986 levels,"
Guerard said.

Wall Street traders said the stock of

    Outboard was up 3-1/8 to 34-5/8. On Tuesday it rose 1-3/8

    Outboard Marine last June adopted a shareholder rights plan
that will be triggered when a person or group acquires

    Wayne Jones, vice president at Outboard for strategic
planning, said management wants to stay independent. "We are
not trying to sell the company. We are proceeding with our
strategic plans," he said.
    That plan includes integrating five boat companies that
Outboard Marine has bought since the middle of December. Jones

"decent" price for outboard. "A bdding war to 50 or 60 dlrs a
share is stretching it. Maybe 45 dlrs a share tops," he said.
    Outboard, which has 17 mln shares outstanding, is in
registration for a two mln common share offering with Morgan
Stanley Inc. It makes sense, the analyst said, for Sun Chemical
to strike before the offering is underway.

The size of French 1986/87 carryover
barley stocks, estimated at 1.72 mln tonnes compared with
700,000 tonnes in 1985/86 is worrying, French Cereals
Intervention Office (ONIC) Director Bernard Vieux said.
    He told journalists these estimates were unchanged at the
end of February from the previous month while export forecasts
were lowered to 4.5 mln tonnes from 5.76 mln in 1985/86.
    Vieux called on the EC Commission to help by awarding a
larger volume of export certificates and said if no outlets are
opened for French barley a large amount could be put into
intervention.
    A small amount of French barley has already been put into
intervention, Vieux said without detailing the amount.
    The outlook for French maize is better with 1986/87 exports
to non-EC countries now put at 700,000 tonnes against 200,000
tonnes at the end of January and against 155,000 tonnes in
1985/86.
    The higher estimate is due to the EC Commission's decision
to hold special export tenders for French maize, he said.

The Canadian Wheat Board has advised
the federal government to sharply cut initial prices paid to
farmers for their wheat, oats, and barley in the crop year
beginning August 1, a board spokesman said.
    The spokesman declined to give the size of the recommended
price drops but said it would not be good news for western
Canadian grain growers.
    "They're all lower," he said. "This is really getting
pretty serious. We're talking nuts and bolts economic survival
and whether it's worthwhile for farmers to put in a crop."
    Farm leaders and economists have estimated the board will
recommend cuts of around 20 pct in the initial prices.
    Farmers receive the initial payment when the grain is
delivered to the elevators used by the wheat board.
    If the wheat board, which markets most of Canada's grain,
obtains higher than expected prices on world markets, the
farmers receive a final payment at the end of the crop year. If
prices are lower, the federal treasury makes up the difference.
    The final decision on the initial prices, usually made in
April, rests with Wheat Board Minister Charles Mayer and the
federal cabinet.
    Last year Mayer cut the initial prices between 19 and 27
pct but last fall the government announced a one billion
Canadian dlr aid program to compensate for the price cuts.
    But federal agricultural officials have already warned
farmers not to depend on additional government aid this year.

General Motors Corp staged an explosive
rally on Wall Street after a share buyback program announced
yesterday, but analysts said GM's future remains clouded by
stiff competition and erosion of market share.
    GM shares rose 3-1/2 to 79-1/8 in active trading. Analysts
agreed that investors liked the repurchase program but they 
differed sharply over the carmaker's long term prospects.
    "I'm very positive on GM," said Jack Kirnan of Kidder
Peabody and Co. "They're clearly committed to enhancing
shareholder value."
    However, some analysts worry about how GM will pay for the
buyback and whether new models will enable the carmaker to
recapture lost market share.
    After the market had closed yesterday, GM said it would buy
back 20 pct of its common stock by the end of 1990. The
announcement sent investors today scrambling for GM shares,
with more than 3.2 mln shares changing hands by mid-day.
    The buyback plan caused several analysts bullish on the
stock to reiterate buy recommendations this morning, and at
least one increased his earnings estimates for GM based on a
good performance expected from new car models.
    But David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc said the
repurchase program is not a positive.
    "The buyback doesn't really change the earnings outlook and
puts more stress on the balance sheet," he said, since GM will
have to borrow money to pay for the stock purchases. The stock
should settle back down to around 76, he added.
    Healy projects GM will earn five dlrs a share in 1987 and
5.50 dlrs in 1988, compared to 1986 earnings of 8.21 dlrs.
Healy's numbers are near the low end of Wall Street estimates,
which range from five dlrs to 7.80 dlrs in 1987 and from four
dlrs to 10.80 dlrs in 1988.
    Like other analysts, Healy sees GM's share of the domestic
car and truck market falling in 1987. "On balance, GM cars are
not selling as well as their competitors," he said.
    In late February, GM car sales fell 8.6 pct from the
year-ago period while competitors Ford Motor Co <F> and
Chrysler Corp <C> both posted increases. But GM said February
sales showed improvement over January, adding that it expects
improvement in coming months.
    Overall, GM's share of U.S. car and truck sales should fall
to around 38 or 39 pct in 1987 from 41 pct at the end of 1986,
analysts said. The numbers include imports.
    Kidder Peabody's Kirnan said cost reductions and product
improvements this year should lead to positive cash flow by the
fourth quarter, which will help GM finance the buyback.
    "GM (stock) has been a real laggard and now it's rolling up
its sleeves and getting serious. I think there's a major
earnings surprise in the winds," he said.
    Kirnan raised his earnings estimates slightly today, in
part in reaction to the announced buyback, and sees GM earning
5.65 dlrs this year and 9.75 dlrs in 1988. "The company is more
concerned than ever about improving their relative valuation
with respect to Ford and Chrysler," he said.
    Another positive for the stock is GM's dividend, currently
five dlrs a share annually, which gives it a higher yield than
its competitors, Kirnan said. And GM will raise the cash
dividend 25 to 50 cts a share next year, he predicted.
    But analyst Michael Lucky of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc
said U.S. car sales will weaken, and GM's new products, if
successful, will only slow but not halt the erosion of its
market share.
    "I believe their new cars will be successful, but that will
only curtail losses in market share," which will fall to around
35 pct by 1990, Lucky said.
    Philip Fricke of Goldman Sachs and Co falls in the middle
of the bulls and bears. While he is recommending GM stock, he
said results will not improve until 1988.
    "I'm not looking for improvement this year. This is a
transition year for GM," he said.
    Fricke, who estimates 1987 earnings at 7.80 dlrs and 1988
at 10.80 dlrs, said cost cutting and new car models will not
affect 1987 results. "But the key thing isn't so much what they
earn this year. It's the momentum beyond this year that's
important."

The U.K. Offshore oil industry has
suffered from last year's collapse in oil prices but should not
sustain any permament damage, Minister of State for Energy
Alick Buchanan-Smith said.
    The drilling, diving and supply vessels sectors had been
most affected, Buchanan Snith told the House of Commons energy
committee. He noted, however, that oil companies were still
spending six mln stg a day to maintain North Sea production.
    He added that a report by the manpower services committee
which said 14,000 jobs were lost in the industry in 1986 should
be seen in the context of a total workforce of 300,000.
    Prices of North Sea Brent-grade crude dipped to a low of
8.50
dlrs a barrel last July from a peak of over 30 dlrs the
previous November.
    They recovered to around 18 dlrs a barrel after last

    Buchanan-Smith said the U.K. Has no intention of adopting

French oil group Total Cie Francaise des
Petroles <TPN.PA> is still expecting a 1.5 billion franc
consolidated net loss, including minority interests, for 1986,
after taking account of stock losses of 7.5 billion francs, the
company said in a communique after a board meeting here.
    In late January group president Francois-Xavier Ortoli told
journalists that the slump in oil prices and the weak dollar
had caused the stock depreciation, turning a consolidated net
profit, before losses on stocks, of six billion francs into a
consolidated net loss of 1.5 billion francs.
    Earlier today Armand Guilbaud, president of Total's
refining and distribution subsidiary Cie de
Raffinage-Distribution (CRD) Total France <RAFF.PA>, told
journalists that 1986 had marked a return to profit for the
subsidiary before stock depreciation.
    CRD made a net profit before stock depreciation and
currency factors of 1.95 billion francs last year after a 1.16
billion loss in 1985.
    But its net loss last year, taking account of that
depreciation as well as currency fluctuations, was 1.16 billion
francs after a 1.05 billion loss in 1985.
    In 1986 CRD's sales fell 5.7 pct to 19.7 mln tonnes from
20.9 mln "due to the growth in imports by independent
distributors following a relaxation of regulations," Guilbaud
said.
    The subsidiary is expecting to cut its workforce to 6,000
this year and 5,000 in 1988 from 6,800 last year, under a job
reduction scheme which will eventually save the group 600 mln
francs, he said.
    Concerning business in 1987, he said that "January was a
good month, but the situation deteriorated in February."

Texas Railroad Commissioner James
Nugent, saying that the ailing oilpatch cannot wait for
Congress to act, today urged Texas state lawmakers to adopt
incentives to find new oil reserves and to exempt severance
taxes on oil produced from stripper wells.
    Nugent said in a speech to the Texas house of
representatives that the state must take the initiative in
molding U.S. energy policy and finding new ways to assist
troubled oil producers.
    His proposal to revitalize Texas' oil industry would exempt
stripper wells that produce 10 barrels of oil or less each day
from the state's 4.6 pct severance tax. He said that the
majority of Texas' oil wells fall within the stripper well
category and a price swing of two to three dlrs a barrel can be
crucial in determining if the well remains in production.
    Nugent also called for state lawmakers to exempt new
wildcat wells from the state severance tax for up to five years
as a financial incentive to explore for new oil reserves.
    Secondary and tertiary oil production, expensive methods of
production that inject water or gas into the ground to recover
oil, should also be exempted from the severance tax, Nugent
said. His plan would exempt existing secondary and tertiary
wells that produce at a rate of less than three barrels a day
for three years, or until the price of oil reaches $25 a
barrel.
    "We've been sitting back and waiting on two federal
administrations to develop a coherent energy policy for the
nation to follow. I say we have waited long enough," Nugent
said. "In other words, let's tell Washington to either lead,
follow, or get out of the way."
    Nugent said that the financial losses to the state treasury
by exempting marginal oil production from state severance taxes
would be more than made up by stimulating new business for the
oil supply and service industry.

Pacific Telesis Group chairman Donald
Guinn told a meeting of security analysts that the company sees
continued earnings growth in 1987 above the 1.08 billion dlrs,
or 5.02 dlrs per share, earned in 1986.
    Guinn also said that capital spending stood at about 1.8
billion dlrs in 1986, and the company expected the figure to
remain flat each year through 1989. He noted that all captial
spending will be internally financed.
    Guinn also told analysts that the company faced some
regulatory uncertainties in ongoing rate cases at its Pacific
Bell operating company.
    In rates hearings before, the California Public Utility
Commission, Guinn said the company faced a potential 76 mln dlr
revenue reduction, and due to ongoing discussions with the
commission, he said the figure might even be greater.
    The company also faces some opposition to a 225 mln dlr
rate hike requested for 1986. Guinn said the commission found
180 mln dlrs of the hike was based on questionable calculations
and assumptions, while 45 mln dlrs might represented unneeded
modernization costs.
    Guinn also said that the company is still studying whether
to join an international consortium that plans to lay a
transpacific telephone cable between the U.S. and Japan.
    "We have not agreed to anything," Guinn said, but added he
would soon recieve a feasibility study on the venture and the
company would make a decision soon on participating.
    Asked by an analyst about the recent recommendation by the
U.S. Department of Justice which would allow the Bell operating
companies to offer limited long distance services, Guinn said
the company would likely shy away from that type of expansion.
    "(Long distance services) is a very competitive business.
It's a commodity business and becoming more so," he said. "I'm
not so sure we would be interested in getting back into that
business."
    However, Guinn generally applauded the U.S.
recommendations, saying they would give more latitude for the
Bell operating companies to expand into non-regulated
businesses and provide more flexibility to form strategic
alliances with other companies.
    He added that while the company welcomes the expansion into
new areas, it is not currently involved in any acqusition
talks. "We do not have anything actively under consideration,"
he said.

The Canadian government's reduced
borrowing needs enabled the Bank of Canada to make "aggressive
use" of short term debt instruments and pare the cost of
financing in 1986, the central bank said in its annual report.
    The report, authored by retired governor Gerald Bouey, also
noted advances to Canadian banks fell to under one billion dlrs
at the end of the year from more than four billion dlrs in
January, 1986, and that the country's economy performed
unevenly while inflation remained a major concern.
    Bouey said the bank was able to reduce the number of new
bond issues with maturities of 10 years of more, lessen the
reliance on Canada Savings Bonds while raising substantailly
more through short term treasury bill financings.
    "The aggressive use of the treasury bill program has meant
that the government is now able to maintain lower cash balances
and lower financing costs," said Bouey who was replaced by
deputy governor John Crow last month.
    The amount of treasury bills outstanding at year end was
69.7 billion dlrs, an increase of 10.3 billion dlrs over the
year and 20 billion dlrs since 1984.
    The reduction in borrrowing needs was brought about by an
eight billion dlr decline in the government's financing
requirements, a run down in Ottawa's cash balances, and
generation of 2.3 billion dlrs from foreign exchange
transactions.
    Also in pursuit of shorter term financing, the bank made
greater use of bond auctions to market new issues with two to
five year maturities, Bouey said.
    Bouey said payments to chartered banks, which are made to
banks that are facing liquidity problems, dropped to an average
of 832.3 mln dlrs at end of December from a peak of 5.2 billion
dlrs in March, 1986.
    The advances were made largely to four banks, Canadian
Commercial Bank, Northland Bank, Continental Bank of Canada and
the Bank of British Columbia. The first two banks have been
liquidated, which enabled partial repayment of advances, and
the remaining two banks were sold and the new owners repaid the
advances.

    TWA said that in respect to USAir's recent offer for

    TWA said, however, it also would be interested in
discussing a three way deal among USAir, Piedmont and TWA.
    TWA said the merger is subject to the USAir board redeeming
the preferred stock purchase rights (the poison pill) issued to
shareholders last year and taking action so that the vote of a
majority of the outstanding common stock is required to approve
its proposed move.
    Additionally, TWA said it would need a satisfactory due

Key tax and budget lawmakers
Wednesday expressed reservations about the suggested new
securities tax, which has has aroused concern on Wall Street
and put pressure on brokerage stocks.
    Grappling with the need to either raise taxes or cut
federal spending to meet the fiscal 1988 budget deficit target
of 108 billion dlrs, House Speaker Jim Wright suggested the tax
be studied as one way to raise more federal revenues.
    The Texas Democrat's idea as first presented to House Ways
and Means Committee chairman Dan Rostenkowski this week would
tax sales and purchases of securities. A tax of 0.25 to 0.5
percent would raise from 8.5 to 17 billion dlrs a year.
    Rostenkowski, the chief taxwriter, considers it too early
to back any tax increase idea but agreed to add the securities
transfer tax to a long list of tax alternatives under review by
congressional tax analysts, a spokesman said.
    The Illinois Democrat has repeatedly stressed this year he
is reluctant to back a tax increase so long as President Reagan
maintains his staunch opposition.
    "First we've got to decide whether to raise additional
revenues. Only then can we consider the specific options. At
this point nothing is on or off the table. It's just too early,"
Rostenkowski said in a statement.
    He made no commitment to Wright in a private meeting
Tuesday, and in fact was not asked for one, a House source
said. The idea was presented only as something that might or
might not be valuable, he said.
    House Budget Committee chairman William Gray agreed it was
another option to be looked at, if Congress decided it needed
to raise revenues to reduce the deficit, an aide said.
   The Pennsylvania Democrat does not intend to recommend
specific tax proposals, the aide said. The Budget Committee
will recommend a certain amount of revenue to be raised in
1988, but will leave to the taxwriting committee the decision
on how the taxes will be raised.
    The securities transfer tax would raise a hefty amount of
revenue to ease Congress's difficult task of trimming the
deficit by 61 billion dlrs this year to meet the target.
    But some in Congress feared that such a tax could drive
securities business offshore and hurt U.S. investment, and
there were uncertainties about the details of the tax.
    Democrats have not united behind any budget alternatives so
far this year. This week they are scheduled to discuss the
budget and possible spending cuts or tax increases but no
decisions are anticipated, congressional sources said.
    At the same time, without President Reagan's assent to a
general tax increase, they are left with piecemeal taxes that
are guaranteed to anger those who must pay.
    "We could just do all of them," one congressional source said
of the various tax ideas -- excise taxes, securities taxes, oil
import fee and others.

    "We are solidly opposed to opening up the 1985 farm bill,"
said Dean Kleckner, president. "The current farm bill has been
in place for just a little over a year and in our judgment
there is more to be gained at the present time from maintaining
the legislation.
    "Several independent studies ... indicate the 1985 farm
bill is better on balance than any of the alternatives being
advanced," Kleckner said.
    The Farm Bureau also urged Agriculture Secretary Richard
Lyng to adjust the loan rate for 1987 crop soybeans as much as
he deems possible under the farm bill to keep soybeans
competitive in the world market.
    A Farm Bureau proposal suggests that producers should be
eligible for supplemental payments in the form of PIK
certificates for the difference between 5.02 dlrs a bushel and
the new loan rate.
    The organization also urged Lyng to authorize deficiency
payments to farmers who were unable to plant 1987 winter wheat
because of adverse weather.

Trans World Airlines Inc complicated
the bidding for Piedmont Aviation Inc by offering either to buy
Piedmont suitor USAir Group or, alternatively, to merge with
Piedmont and USAir.
    Piedmont's board was meeting today, and Wall Street
speculated the board was discussing opposing bids from Norfolk
Southern Corp and USAir. The TWA offer was announced shortly
after the Piedmont board meeting was scheduled to begin.
    TWA offered to buy USAir for 52 dlrs cash per share. It
also said it was the largest shareholder of USAir and
threatened to go directly to USAir shareholders with an offer
for 51 pct of the stock at a lower price.
    TWA also said it believed its offer was a better deal for
USAir shareholders than an acquisition of Piedmont, but it said
it alternatively would discuss a three-way combination of the
airlines.
    Market sources and analysts speculated that TWA chairman
Carl Icahn made the offer in order to put his own airline into
the takeover arena.
    "We're just wondering if he's not just trying to get TWA
into play. There's speculation on the street he just wants to
move onto somthing else," said one arbitrager. "We think TWA
might just be putting up a trial balloon."
    Analysts said the offer must be taken seriously by USAir,
but that the airline will probably reject it because the price
is relatively low compared to other airline deals.
    They also said Icahn must prove his offer credible by
revealing financing arrangements. "They need to show their
commitment and their ability to finance. I think it's a
credible offer," said Timothy Pettee, a Bear Stearns analyst.
    "I think it's certainly on the low end of relative values
of airline deals," said Pettee. Pettee estimated 58 dlrs would
be in a more reasonable range based on other airline mergers.
    USAir stock soared after TWA made public its offer. A
spokesman for USAir declined comment, and said USAir had not
changed its offer for Piedmont. USAir offered of buy 50 pct of
that airline's stock for 71 dlrs cash per share and the balance
for 73 dlrs per share in USAir stock.
    USAir closed up 5-3/8 at 49-1/8 on volume of 1.9 mln
shares.
    Piedmont, which slipped 1/2 to close at 69-5/8, also
remained silent on the TWA action. Piedmont has an outstanding
65 dlr cash per share offer from Norfolk Southern Corp.
    Norfolk Southern declined comment, but said it stuck with
its offer for Piedmont. Norfolk owns about 20 pct of Piedmont
and opened the bidding when it said it would propose a takeover
of Piedmont.
    Some analysts said Icahn may be trying to acquire USAir to
make his own airline a more attractive takeover target.
    "Icahn I think had wanted to sell his airline and there
were no takers. I think the strategy might have called for
making his investment more attractive. One way to accomplish
that specific objective is to go out and acquire other
airlines," said Andrew Kim of Eberstadt Fleming.
    "I don't know whose going to buy them, but at least this
way it becomes a much more viable package," said Kim.
    But Icahn's financing ability for such a transaction
remains in doubt, in part because of TWA's heavy debt load.
    Wall street sources said TWA has some cash with which to do
the offer.
    The sources said Icahn has not lined up outside financial
advisers and plans to make his own arrangements.
   Icahn earlier this year abandoned plans to buy USX Corp <X>
and still retains 11 pct of that company's stock.
    Some Wall street sources said the financier's USX plan was
impacted by the cloud hanging over his adviser, Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc, because of Wall Street's insider trading scandal.
    Industry sources also predicted USAir might reject the TWA
offer on price and financing concerns. "It's littered with
contingencies and it doesn't even have a financing
arrangement," said one executive at another major airline.
    But the executive conceded a merged TWA-USAir would be a
strong contender with USAir's east coast route system and
planned west coast presence from PSA. USAir could feed the
intenrational flights of TWA, which has a midwest presence in
its St. Louis hub. Adding Piedmont, dominant in the southeast,
to the mix would develop an even stronger force.
    The combined entity would also have TWA's pars reservation
system.
    Such a merger would be complex and analysts said it would
result in an airline iwth an 18 pct market share.

Sales of new cars by the U.S. auto
industry rose 6.7 pct in late February from the weak levels of
a year ago, but industry giant General Motors Corp <GM> was an
exception with an eight pct drop.
    The figures represented a slight recovery for the industry
from weak mid-February sales, but the eight domestic-based car
manufacturers still saw sales fall 9.1 pct for the full month
from last year.
    GM, whose sales have been weakening for several months,
took only 48.1 pct of domestic car sales in the February 21-28
period compared with 55.7 pct a year ago, when sales for the
entire industry were depressed from the ending of major
marketing incentive campaigns.
    At the same time, rival Ford Motor Co <F> said its car
sales in the period rose 29.3 pct and Chrysler Corp <C> was up
11.3 pct.

full month as GM took only 37 pct of all car sales in February,
including imports, compared with 43.5 pct a year ago.

seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 7.0 mln units while the
556,953 sold in the month were at a 7.4 mln annual rate.
    Last year, the industry sold a record 11.44 mln new cars,
including 8.2 mln domestic makes. But consumers have taken a
breather since then and car sales sales have been weaker in
1987 due to tax-induced heavy buying in December, a lack of
widespread sales incentives and intermitent bad weather,
analysts said.

Bank of Canada Governor John Crow said he
expects the Canadian economy will grow moderately in the coming
year, despite the near flat growth in the final quarter of
1986.
    "We see moderate growth," Crow told a news conference

    He said there were positive signs of growth in the economy,
particularly the drawdown of business inventories in the fourth
quarter. Yesterday, Statistics Canada reported gross domestic
product expanded a slight 0.2 pct in the quarter.
    Crow reiterated the bank's previous statements that
inflation remains a major priority in setting monetary policy
and said only zero inflation would be acceptable. Canada's
inflation rate is currently hovering around the four pct mark.

Allis-Chalmers Corp said it asked
lenders and other groups to approve a restructuring plan that
would cause a dilution of the company's existing common stock.
    The company said it would sell all of its businesses other
than the American Air Filter business, make a public financing
of more than 100 mln dlrs and pay part of the currently
outstanding debt with the proceeds.
    Under the plan, which was presented to institutional
lenders, the company's unions and the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corp, "substantial amounts" of institutional debt would be
converted to common stock of the restructured company.
    Allis-Chalmers said it will exchange existing preferred
stock for common. The exchange of the institutional debt and
preferred stock for common equity will cause a "resulting
dilution of the existing common stock," Allis-Chalmers said in
a statement.
    Under the plan, holders of existing common would hold about
15 pct of the restructured common stock. Holders of existing
preferred would hold about 35 pct of the new common.
    Allis-Chalmers said its only alternative to the plan is
bankruptcy. The restructuring must be approved by creditors,
common and preferred holders,and present and former employees.
    Allis-Chalmers said a bankruptcy filing "appears to
represent the company's only alternative if agreement upon the
terms of the plan cannot be reached."
    The spokesman said in response to an inquiry that he was
not aware of any extraordinary charge against earnings that
would result from the restructuring.
    "It is too early to talk about a charge" because the plan
must still be approved by the lenders and unions, he said.
    Also under the plan, payments to Allis-Chalmers' private
lenders would be deferred. Trade payables and obligations
incurred in the ordinary course of business will be met.
    Payment of health benefits for active and retired employees
would be made "at substantially reduced levels."
    Allis-Chalmers, once one of the leading farm equipment
companies, sold all of its farm equipment operations to Deutz
of West Germany for 107 mln dlrs, leaving the company with
businesses in lift trucks, air conditioning, fluids handling
and solid materials processing.
    Last year, Allis-Chalmers sold the lift truck business to
AC Material Handling Co of Columbus, Ohio.
    Under the restructuring plan, Allis-Chalmers will sell its
solid materials processing and fluids handling businesses.
Solid materials processing, which makes equipment to crush
stones for highway construction, accounted for 288 mln dlrs of
Allis-Chalmers's total 1985 revenues of 886 mln dlrs.
    The company will also sell its fluids handling operations,
which makes pumps and valves. That business accounted for 196
mln dlrs of the company's 1985 revenues.
    Allis-Chalmers in 1986 reported a net loss of 8.6 mln dlrs,
or 1.09 dlrs a share. In 1985, the company lost 168.4 mln dlrs,
or 12.27 dlrs a share.
    The company's last profit was in 1980, when it earned 52.4
mln dlrs on sales of 2.1 billion dlrs.

A former TRW Inc controller told a
Congressional hearing that the company had acted unethically in
its defense contracts with the government.
    "It is my contention that the company called TRW is not ever
vigilant and highly ethical as a defense contractor. TRW only
pretends to be an honest citizen when that scheme best fits
their financial interests," Larry Eagleye said in testimony at a
House Oversight subcommittee hearing.
    Eagleye was a controller at TRW's compressor components
division in Cleveland.
    Subcommittee chairman John Dingell, D-Mich, said he did not
understand why the Defense Department had taken no action
against TRW even though it admitted in the 1984 report that it
had substantially overcharged the government for military
aircraft parts.
    "In 1984, TRW officials admitted to the Defense Department
Inspector General that they had evidence of two sets of books
and other problems in one of the company's divisions in
Cleveland and that there had been substantial overcharging of
the federal government on various military aircraft parts,"
Dingell said.
    "For example, by falsifying its books and records, TRW
inflated the price of a military engine blade by two to three
times higher than the price of a virtually identical commercial
engine blade," Dingell said in a statement.
    Eagleye and two other former employees filed a suit against
TRW last year charging the company with overcharging the
government. The Justice Department later joined the suit.
    "While employed by TRW and while under investigation by TRW,
I disclosed to TRW's legal department and higher management,
many flagrant and obvious violations of law, company policy and
ethical conduct. None of this evidence was included in TRW's
(1984) report to the government," he said.

Record high borrowing of 376 billion dlrs
in 1986 on international capital markets was supported by a
large volume of debt refinancing and growing integration
between national and international markets, the OECD said.
    The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD) said in its latest Financial Market Trends report the 34
pct rise over 1985 volume was accompanied by major changes in
the relative importance of the instruments used in
international financing.
    Straight bond offerings, equity related securities and
euro-commercial paper programmes as a share in total financing
rose to their highest level this decade. The markets for
floating-rate notes and for note issuance facilities declined.
    The OECD said another striking feature of international
capital markets in 1986 was the unprecedented concentration of
lending to the OECD group of western industrialised countries,
which accounted for 90 pct of total borrowing.
    Factors behind the heightened pace of activity included a
notable decline in interest rates which boosted borrowing
through the flotation of fixed-interest securities.
    This in turn was stimulated by growing familiarity with new
techniques such as interest rate and currency swaps.
    Stockmarket buoyancy supported the expansion of
equity-related bond issues and favoured the expansion of a
rapidly expanding market for euro-equities.
    A slowdown in net demand for funds by sovereign borrowers
was more than offset by a large volume of refinancing
operations induced by improved market conditions and stronger
debt management policies. Growing integration with national
markets meant the arrival of a large number of new players on
international markets.
    It added the development of a smoothly-functioning market
for short-term euro-notes made committee and non-underwritten
issuance facilities an increasingly popular alternative to
traditional forms of bank lending.
    Turning to 1987, the OECD pointed to indications of a
possible slowdown of international markets' expansion and
possibly less easy borrowing terms in a number of market areas.
    It said many market participants saw little scope for a
further decline in long-term rates and anticipate a slowdown in
the pace of fixed-rate activity in the months ahead.
    It saw little reason for a turnaround in the decline in
demand of recent years, although it was likely more borrowers
would try to make use of cost-reducing opportunities provided
by the market for euro-commercial paper.
    "It remains to be seen however to what extent the ECP market
will be ready to absorb a significant volume of paper from
lower-rated borrowers," the report said, adding that any major
advance in the euro-note market's absorptive capacity would
require a significantly broader investor base.

Trading in energy futures on the New
York Mercantile Exchange will change dramatically over the next
five to 10 years as the market matures, according to outgoing
chairman Michel Marks.
    "Energy futures trading is going through a tremendous
period of transition that will last five to 10 years," Marks
said, adding that volume will soar, international participation
will increase, and activity of producing countries, major oil
companies, and speculators will grow.
    Marks steps down as chairman after an nine-year tenure when
board elections are held March 17. He will continue as chairman
of a long-range planning committee at NYMEX.
    "The priority of the next 10 years is operational
efficiency versus the last 10 years when it was new product
development," said Marks.
    Marks said it is imperative for NYMEX, which is running out
of trading space, to process greater volumes expeditiously in
order to handle the growth in volumes and new contracts that
are already planned.
    Marks said crude futures volume could more than double by
the end of the decade to 250,000 contracts daily and combined
products volume could soar to  100,000 contracts a day.
    Much of the increased activity will come from the
international sector, according to Marks. "That's a huge growth
area," he said, adding that it will run the gamut from foreign
producer countries to foreign independent operators.
     He said it would be difficult to develop a futures
contract based on an internationally traded crude although he
previously said the exchange is exploring that possibility.
    "Trying to develop a futures contract in any other crude
besides West Texas Intermediate will be a tough task" he said.
     Marks said it is more likely a futures contract based on
an international product rather than an international crude
will be developed since the products market is more diverse. He
said previously the exchange is studying the possibility of
developing a non-U.S. deliverable products contract.
    Other sources of growth for U.S. energy futures are the
major oil companies, which already trade on the NYMEX, and
institutional funds such as investment houses, pension funds,
and insurance companies, Marks said.
    "The commodities markets have become financial markets and
should pursue a partnership with financial intermediaries,"
Marks said.
    He said speculators will increase their share of the energy
futures markets in the coming years from the current  share of
about 30 pct. Hedgers, as a result, will lose some of their 70
pct share.

The Securities Industry Association
endorsed legislation expected to come before the Senate Banking
Committee tomorrow imposing a moratorium on new powers for
commercial banks.
    Robert Gerard, managing director of Morgan Stanley and Co,
told reporters his group, which mainly represents investment
banking firms, supported committee members who want the Federal
Reserve Board to postpone action on applications by three bank
holding companies seeking new powers.
    "The Fed ought to hold those applications in abeyance
pending congressional review," Gerard said.     
    The legislation before the committee would recapitalize a
federal desposit insurance fund for savings and loan
associations and prohibit new nonbank banks.
    Gerard said the securities association had no position on
nonbank banks.
    The association wants Congress to undertake a comprehensive
study before changing the Glass-Steagall Act, which separates
commercial and investment banking activities, Gerard said.
Until the study is completed, the Fed should not act on the
applications by Citicorp, J.P. Morgan and Co. and Bankers Trust
New York Corp to underwrite and deal in securities, he said.   
    The study was likely to show substantial benefits from
continuing the separation of commercial and investment banking,
he said.
    Gerard said the group believes a proposal by House Speaker
Jim Wright for a tax on securities was unjustified and would
hurt individual investors and beneficiaries of pension funds
that invest in securities.
    "It may reduce the volume of activity, but the tax is a tax
on the saver and investor," Gerard said.

The rally Wednesday in U.S. interest
rate futures left the Treasury bond contract above the top of a
three month trading range which signals a bullish chart
breakout, financial analysts said.
    In addition, sluggish U.S. economic data and little sign
that the economy will pick up its pace in the near future may
be enough to send bond futures to all-time highs, the analysts
said.
    "The market is paying more attention to the weakened state
of the economy right now," said Refco analyst Mike Connery.
    Connery said the four pct drop in January U.S. factory
orders reinforced sentiment that first quarter economic growth
will be slow.
    Connery and other analysts noted that talk of a cut in the
Lombard rate after sluggish West German industrial production
figures also provided some support.
    "The domestic economies of the major trading partners of
the U.S. may deteriorate to such an extent that they will be
forced to ease," thus paving the way for a more accomodative
U.S. credit policy, added John Michael, analyst at First
Options of Chicago.
    Michael pointed out, however, that trimming the U.S. trade
deficit -- the ultimate aim of the recent meeting of major
industrial countries -- may not necessarily aid bond prices.
    "The surplus (for exporters to the U.S.) is bullish for
bonds because they (exporters) have a lot of dollars. Rather
than translate those into their own currencies and suffer
exchange rate risk, they buy dollar-denominated instruments,"
Michael said.
    Indeed, futures traders with cash bond connections said
some of the late strength in the bond market resulted from
buying by Japanese interests.
    But the analysts said the heavy buying in futures occurred
after the June bond broke above stiff resistance at 101-2/32.
    "The breakout is pretty important," said chartist Leslie
Keefe of Technical Data Corp of Boston. "Not only did bonds
close above recent highs but they were also above the sideways
pattern we've been in for the last three months."
    Also positive on a technical basis was the fact that the
June bond contract held chart support early near 100-4/32, and
that the rally occurred on heavy volume, Keefe said.
    Keefe said the next level of significant chart resistance
will be at 101-24/32 to 101-28/32. Furthermore, "we still have
the April (1986) highs to contend with," which in the nearby
contract is 105-15/32.
    Michael said the breakout projects gains to 103 in June
T-bonds and "there is an outside chance to reach 106."
    Keefe warned, however, that confirmation also is needed
from other technical indicators such as relative strength
indexes and short-term momentum indicators.
    "Without them, sustained strength is in question," Keefe
said.

    Hughes vice-president Ike Kerridge said the recommendation
would be put to shareholders at a meeting scheduled for 10 A.M.
Local time (1600 GMT) to discuss the proposed merger.
    Kerridge said the board met yesterday to discuss the merger
but decided against it.
    The Hughes board objected to a U.S. Department of Justice
requirement that Baker sell off several specialised
subsidiaries in businesses related to oil-drilling.
    The Hughes board last week indicated that it might cancel
the merger because of the Department of Justice requirement.
    The board of directors of the California-based Baker had
approved the merger. On February 17 Baker said it had signed an
agreement to sell one of the subsidiaries.
    The companies had been given until April 22 to comply with
the Justice Department requirement, Kerridge said.

    Of the total, 300 billion yen will yield 3.9989 pct on the
sales from money houses to banks and securities houses in
27-day repurchase agreement, due April 2.
    The remaining 200 billion yen will yield 3.9994 pct in a

    The repurchase agreement yields compare with the 4.0625 pct
one-month commercial bill discount rate today and the 4.50/43

Japanese private plant and equipment
investment will grow 0.1 pct in fiscal 1987, starting April 1,
from 1986 due mainly to a continued slump in manufacturing
sector spending, the Japan Development Bank said.
    Capital spending by manufacturing industries, hit hard by
the rise of the yen, will fall 5.6 pct, a survey said.
    Planned investment by non-manufacturing firms will grow
four pct as industries like leasing and transport that have
benefitted from the yen's rise will remain robust, it said.
    The 0.1 pct overall increase compares to the 3.1 pct rise
the bank projected for the current fiscal year.
    In the manufacturing sector, iron and steel companies are
the most pessimistic, with an estimated 18.0 pct spending cut.
    Investment by precision machinery and textile firms will
decline by 18 pct and 11.2 pct respectively, the survey said.
    In the non-manufacturing sector, transport and leasing
service industries are expected to increase their spending by
15.7 pct and 10.6 pct, respectively.

Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party
started moves to push through the delayed draft budget for
1987/88 through Parliament, deepening a clash with the
opposition which called the move rash and unforgivable.
    In the absence of the opposition, LDP members of parliament
decided at a meeting of the Lower House Steering Committee to
hold a public hearing on the draft budget on March 13 and 14,
parliamentary officials said.
    The step came after Parliament resumed deliberations last
Tuesday following a month-long opposition boycott over a
controversial government-proposed sales tax plan.
    Four opposition parties led by the Socialists have been
delaying budget deliberations in a bid to shelve the sales tax
on which the budget plan is based.
    A Socialist spokesman said the opposition would again
boycott parliament unless the LDP changed its mind.
    Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, who has vowed to push
through the tax reforms, told reporters: "Watching closely
negotiations between the ruling and opposition parties, I would
like to avoid ... Passing (the budget) singlehandedly."
    The five pct tax, part of Nakasone's tax reform plan, is
planned to start next January to help offset cuts in individual
income and corporate tax.
    The opposition objected to fixing a date for the hearing
because the LDP could technically stop deliberations on the
budget and ram it through the budget committee and then a Lower
House plenary session, political analysts said.
    The four opposition parties called the LDP move "an
unforgivable, rash act" and said they would fight to scrap the
sales tax.

The outlook for the West
German economy is relatively bright, with gross national
product expected to expand by three pct this year, Kiel
University's Institute for World Economy said.
    The GNP forecast by the institute, one of five leading
economic research bodies in West Germany, is more optimistic
than that of the other institutes, some of which have recently
reduced their GNP forecasts to between two and 2.5 pct.
    In a report the Kiel institute said West Germany's export
outlook has not deteriorated fundamentally despite the mark's
strength against the dollar and other major currencies.
    "The danger that exports will slump in 1987 appears, all in
all, limited," the report said. "On the contrary, a slight rise
in exports can be expected."
    The institute said past experience has shown West German
exporters will move to counterbalance currency factors by
cutting costs, trying to penetrate new markets and adjusting
their product ranges.
    They will be aided in 1987 by an expected slight rise in
economic growth in industrial countries. At the same time, the
decline in exports to oil producing countries looks set to slow
this year.
    West German GNP growth in 1987 will be led by renewed
advances in domestic consumption and investment spending, both
of which will in turn be buoyed by an expansionary monetary
policy, the institute said.
    However, it said the labour market would see only a slight
improvement because companies will be reluctant to hire
additional workers due to higher labour costs caused partly by
agreed reductions in working hours.
    The institute cautioned that the expansionary stance of
monetary policy in West Germany was likely to bring a marked
acceleration of inflation.
    It also warned that what it called the worldwide
synchronization of monetary policy heightened the risk of a new
global recession. It said central banks in industrialized
countries, including the Bundesbank, had followed the Federal
Reserve Board's expansionary course.
    The institute said this in turn was bound to lead
eventually to a rise in worldwide inflation and a shift in U.S.
Policy towards a more restrictive policy. Other central banks
were likely to follow suit, causing a recession that could
aggravate the debt crisis of developing countries as well as
increase protectionism around the world.
    Although Germany cannot entirely shield itself from the
negative effects of the global synchronization of monetary
policy, it should do all it can to strengthen the forces of
growth at home.
    The institute said this could be done by ensuring that
fiscal policy fosters a willingness to work and invest. Taxes
should be cut by a greater amount than currently planned, and
wage increases in 1987 and 1988 should be markedly lower than
in 1986. It also said the Bundesbank should reduce inflationary
pressures by cutting the current rate of growth in money supply
to about four pct.

Britain had a visible trade deficit of
2.6 billion stg in the fourth quarter of 1986 against a revised
deficit of 2.9 billion in the third quarter, official
statistics show.
    Seasonally-adjusted figures issued by the Central
Statistical Office (CSO) show the current account was in
deficit by 760 mln stg against an upwardly revised third
quarter shortfall of 930 mln.
    For 1986 as a whole, visible trade was in deficit by 8.3
billion stg, sharply up from 1985's 2.2. Billion shortfall and
a 4.4 billion deficit in 1984.
    Preliminary figures for invisible transactions in the
fourth quarter show a surplus 1.8 billion stg to give an
estimated surplus for 1986 of 7.2 billion. The fourth quarter
figure was in line with CSO projections released on Friday.
    The third quarter invisibles surplus was revised down to
1.9 billion stg from 2.25 billion.
    In 1985 the invisibles surplus was 5.1 billion stg.
    The reduced deficit on visible trade in the fourth quarter
was due to an increase in the surplus on oil of 200 mln stg and
a reduction in the non-oil trade deficit of 100 mln, the CSO
said.
    However, 1986's surplus on oil trade was 4.0 billion stg
lower than in 1985, while the deficit on non-oil trade
increased by 2.1 billion.
    The figures were broadly in line with market expectations.
    The CSO stressed that figures for invisible transactions,
particularly for the most recent quarters are liable to
substantial revisions as later information becomes available.

The Bank of France is likely to cut its
money market intervention rate by up to a quarter point at the
start of next week.  This follows a steady decline in the call
money rate over the past 10 days and signals from the Finance
Ministry that the time is ripe for a fall, dealers said.
    The call money rate peaked at just above nine pct ahead of
the meeting of finance ministers from the Group of Five
industrial countries and Canada on February 22, which restored
considerable stability to foreign exchanges after several weeks
of turbulence.
    The call money rate dropped to around 8-3/8 pct on February
23, the day after the Paris accord, and then edged steadily
down to eight pct on February 27 and 7-3/4 pct on March 3,
where it has now stabilised.
    Dealers said the Bank of France intervened to absorb
liquidity to hold the rate at 7-3/4 pct.
    While call money has dropped by well over a percentage
point, the Bank of France's money market intervention rate has
remained unchanged since January 2, when it was raised to eight
pct from 7-1/4 pct in a bid to stop a franc slide.
    The seven-day repurchase rate has also been unchanged at
8-3/4 since it was raised by a half-point on January 5.
    The Bank of France has begun using the seven-day repurchase
rate to set an upper indicator for money market rates, while
using the intervention rate to set the floor.
    Sources close to Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said
that he would be happy to see an interest rate cut, and dealers
said any fall in the intervention rate was most likely to come
when the Bank of France buys first category paper next Monday,
although an earlier cut could not be excluded.
   A cut in the seven-day repurchase rate could come as early
as tomorrow morning, banking sources said.
    They said recent high interest rates have encouraged an
acceleration in foreign funds returning to France, discouraging
the authorities from making a hasty rate cut. But they also
pointed out that money supply is broadly back on target, giving
scope for a small fall in rates.
    M-3 money supply, the government's key aggregate, finished
1986 within the government's three to five pct growth target,
rising 4.6 pct compared with seven pct in 1985.

Hughes Tool Co said its board has
appointed a committee to search for a chief operating officer
in the event that it does not complete its merger with Baker
International Corp <BKO>.
    Last night, Hughes directors said it would terminate its
agreement to merge with Baker because Baker would only proceed
if Hughes signed a consent decree with the U.S. Justice
Department that the Hughes board had determined to be
unreasonable.
    The post of chief operating officer is now vacant at
Hughes.  Chairman W.A. Kistler Jr. is chief executive officer.
    Hughes said it proposed to Baker that the companies ask the
Justice Department to allow them to proceed with the merger on
condition that they find a buyer approved by the  Department
for the domestic oilfield tricine rock bit assets of Baker's
Reed subsidiary, its Singapore plant and Baker Lift's domestic
electrical submersible pump business by April 22, the last date
the merger of Baker and Hughes could occur under their
agreement.
    Hughes said its proposal would have been conditioned on it
not being required to license the purchaser with any Hughes
technology and on the imposition of no more adverse conditions.
    Hughes said "For reasons Hughes does not fully understand,
Baker declined to proceed in this fashion and insisted that it
would proceed only if Hughes signed the consent decree."
    The company said its board found the consent decree to be
unreasonable because some "unusual terms" in the decree posed a
substantial risk that control of the divestiture of Reed would
be passed to a trustee owing no duties to the shareholders of
the combined company, which would have been called Baker Hughes
Inc, and would include all of Reed's international assets and
its coring and diamond bit assets.
    Hughes said the board also found unacceptable the consent
decree condition that the merged company fund ongoing losses of
Reed and Reed capital expenditures for as long as it took to
sell Reed.
    The company said the board decision to adopt its own
divestiture plan and terminate the merger agreement if Baker
did not accept was unanimous.

Baker International corp said it has
filed suit in state court in Houston to compel Hughes Tool Co
to complete its proposed merger with Baker.
    Late yesterday, Hughes said it had terminated the merger
agreement because Baker would not agree to an alternative
divestiture plan devised by Hughes.  Hughes' board had
previously found unacceptable a U.S. Justice Department consent
decree that would have required broader divestitures.
    Baker said it has not obtained any satisfactory explanation
from Hughes of its objections to the provisions of the Justice
Department consent decree.
    Hughes yesterday adjourned the special meeting at which
shareholders were to vote on the merger without permitting the
counting of votes on the deal.  Baker said it believes the vote
was overwhelmingly in favor of the merger.
    Baker said the new terms that Hughes proposed for the
merger, as an alternative to the consent decree, were "more
burdensome" than those of the consent decree themselves.
    Baker said divestitures under the consent decree would
reduce revenues for the combined company by about 65 mln dlrs
or three pct.
    Baker said it will continue to pursue the divestitures of
the units named in the consent decree.
    It said its suit names as defendants Hughes and certain of
its directors and seeks either an injunction forcing Hughes to
live up to the merger agreement or "substantial" monetary
damages it did not name.
    Baker said it believes the merger to be in the best
interests of shareholders of both companies.

USAir Group Inc said its board has
rejected Trans World Airlines Inc's offer to acquire USAir for
52 dlrs per share in cash as grossly in adequate and not in the
best interests of USAir shareholders, employees or passengers.
    The company said the unsolicited bid by the Carl C.
Icahn-led TWA was "highly conditional."
    USAir said its board and that of Piedmont Aviation Inc
<PIE> met separately yesterday to consider USAir's offer to
acquire 50.1 pct of Piedmont for 71 dlrs per share and
remaining shares for 1.5 to 1.9 common shares each, valued at
about 73 dlrs per share based on the average closing price of
USAir common during a period just before the merger.
    The company said it is continuing talks with Piedmont on
arriving at a definitive merger agreement and the two companies
hope to reach one very shortly.
    USAir said "In light of the highly conditional nature and
other terms of the TWA offer, the timing of the offer and the
circumstances under which it was made, USAir Group believes
that the purpose of the TWA offer is to interfere with USAir
Group's proposed acquisition of Piedmont.
    "TWA's proposal is nothing more than an attempt by Carl
Icahn to disrupt at the eleventh hour USAir Group's acquisition
of Piedmont, a transaction which the USAir Group board views as
most beneficial to USAir Group shareholders, employees and
passengers and which Mr. Icahn obviously regards as contrary to
his own personal interests."
    USAir said its board has authorized counsel to explore all
appropriate legal remedies against what it called TWA's
last-minute attempt to interfere with USAir Group's acquisition
of Piedmont.
    The company said conditions to the TWA offer include TWA
obtaining financing, the USAir board redeeming defensive rights
issued to shareholders last year and acting to render the "fair
price" provision contained in USAir's charter inapplicable to
the TWA offer and Transportation Department approval.

The U.S. economy is facing several
serious problems which threaten its continued expansion,
according to a Congressional report released today.
    The report by the Democratic majority of the Congressional
Joint Economic Committee said the outlook was for sluggish
growth in the U.S. and the rest of the world for the near
future.
    Committee Republicans released a separate, more optimistic
report predicting continued stable growth with low inflation.
    Democrats have a 12 to eight majority on the committee,
which is made up of 10 Senators and 10 Representatives.
    "The annual report of the committee surveys a 3.7 trillion
dlr economy whose tranquil appearance obscures the danger
signals that lie just below the surface," Committee chairman
Sen. Paul Sarbanes said in a statement.
    "A close inspection of the economy reveals that the current
recovery, while long, is fragile, and we are skating on thin
ice," the Maryland Democrat said.
    He said the danger signals included a decline in
investment, increased demand for borrowing which was straining
the financial system, a possible increase in inflation fueled
by higher oil prices and the depressed condition of the
nation's farmers.
    Republicans said most private economists saw no likelihood
of a recession and were predicting a growth rate of around
three pct for this year and next, similar to Administration
forecasts.
    "The economy appears to be on a path of stable growth. We're
comfortable with the current low rate of inflation, hopeful
that interest rates will continue to decline, optimistic that
employment opportunities will continue to improve and confident
in this nation's resilient, innovative and diversified economy,"
the Republican report said.
    "The greatest economic challenge facing the 100th Congress
is reducing the federal deficit," the Republicans added.
    Democrats said the budget deficit should be reduced but
also wanted the government to spend more on education, job
training, research and development and health care.
    They said pressures on the dollar might make it difficult
for the Federal Reserve to use monetary policy to stimulate the
economy if this becomes necessary.
    "There is now substantial concern about the inflationary
effects of a declining dollar and the buildup of monetary
pressure arising from the recent rapid growth in the money
supply," the Democrat report said.
    "At the same time, the increased reliance on foreign sources
of capital in American investment markets means that the
Federal Reserve can no longer be as aggressive as in the past
in lowering interest rates and driving the dollar down."
    "Taken together, the outlook for fiscal and monetary policy
is thus not very encouraging," the Democrats said.
    The Democrats called on the Administration to be more
aggressive in removing foreign trade barriers and in seeking
new initiatives to solve the international debt problem.
    The Democrats said much of the U.S. trade deficit had been
caused by misalignment of the world's currencies, especially
the overvaluation of the dollar that began in 1982.
    Both Democrats and Republicans called for policies to
increase American productivity including incentives for saving
and investment in plant and equipment and development of a
better educated work force.

Jaguar Plc <JAGR.L> is about to sell its
new XJ-6 model on the U.S. And Japanese markets and expects a
strong reception based on its success in the U.K., Chairman Sir
John Egan told a news conference.
    Commenting on an 11 pct growth in 1986 group turnover to
830.4 mln stg and pre-tax profits at 120.8 mln stg, slightly
below 1985's 121.3 mln, Egan said Jaguar aimed at an average
profit growth of 15 pct per year. However, the introduction of
the new model had kept this year's pre-tax profit down.
    Jaguar starts selling XJ-6 in the U.S. In May and plans to
sell 25,000 of its total 47,000 production there in 1987.
    U.S. Sales now account for 65 pct of total turnover,
finance director John Edwards said.
    A U.S. Price for the car has not been set yet, but Edwards
said the relatively high car prices in dollars of West German
competitors offered an "umbrella" for Jaguar. He added the XJ-6
had also to compete with U.S. Luxury car producers which would
restrict the car's price.
    Jaguar hedges a majority of its dollar receipts on a
12-month rolling basis and plans to do so for a larger part of
its receipts for longer periods, John Egan said.
    In the longer term, capital expenditure will amount to 10
pct of net sales. Research and development will cost four pct
of net sales and training two pct.
    Jaguar builds half of its cars and buys components for the
other half. The firm is in early stages of considering the
building of an own press shop in Britain for about 80 mln stg,
but Egan said this would take at least another three years
    On the London Stock Exchange, Jaguar's shares were last
quoted at 591p, down from 611p at yesterday's close, after
reporting 1986 results which were in line with market
expectations, dealers said.

France's state-owned Cie Generale

year, sources close to Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said.
    Although the Finance Ministry simply said that the group
would be privatised during the course of this year, when it
first announced the operation in early January, the May date is
earlier than the market had expected.
    As a result it will follow close on the heels of the
privatisation of the TF1 television channel and the advertising
group <Agence Havas>.
    Last month the government privatised the first of the state
financial groups, Cie Financiere de Paribas <PARI.P>, in a
floatation which was 40 times oversubscribed.
    And in December the first of the industrial groups, glass
maker Cie de Saint-Gobain <SGEP.P>, returned to the private
sector.
    CGE has interests ranging from telecommunications to
shipbuilding and nuclear engineering, and recently struck a

The EC agriculture ministers' agreement on
reducing dairy output puts milk producers in an impossible
situation, French farm unions said.
    The accord to limit butter sales into intervention, part of
planned dairy output cuts of 9-1/2 pct over two years, will cut
milk producers' income, a spokeswoman for France's largest farm
union, the FNSEA, said.
    The move has destroyed part of the Common Agricultural
Policy, French milk producers said in a press release.
    But Agriculture Minister Francois Guillaume said
repercussions of the plan will affect dairies, not farmers.
    "If there are negative repercussions, it will be at the
level of the dairies which have never looked for new outlets
for butter and milk," he told journalists during a visit to
Rouen.
    FNSEA president Raymond Lacombe said on French radio the
milk sector needs restructuring by encouraging early retirement
and helping young farmers to start. But Commission proposals,
rejected by ministers, would have frozen land prices, he said.
    The FNSEA says it will demonstrate over Commission
proposals to freeze most 1987/88 farm prices and cut supports.
Pig farmers have held violent demonstrations over falling pork
prices and milk producers blocked roads in protest at cuts in
milk output.

Enzon Inc said a new
treatment using its investigational new drug PEG-ADA has
restored the functioning of the immune system in the first two
children that were born deficient in the enzyme adenosine
deaminase.
    The disorder is known as severe combined immunodeficiency
disease, or "bubble boy disease"
    Bubble Boy Disease is a rare but severe disease that
hampers the development of the immune system. It has killed
most of its victims before adulthood.
    Children with the disease are consigned to live in a
sterile environment, such as a plastic bubble, to avoid
infection, the company said.
    The study of Enzon's drug, conducted at Duke University,
showed that two children suffering from the disease were
treated for 11 and seven months, respectively, and were free of
serious infection during that time, the company said. The
results were published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
    The disease is caused by a missing enzyme, called Adenosine
Deaminase, or ADA, that is crucial to the development of the
immune system.
    Enzon said it has developed a technology to coat the enzyme
with a substance called polyethylene glycol, or PEG, serving to
disguise the enzyme when it is reintroduced into the body,
preventing rejection.
    "Marked improvement in laboratory tests of immune function
occurred in each child, along with an increase in the number of
T-lymphocytes, the immune cells that were missing before
treatment with PEG-ADA had begun," the study said.
    "The children are now more active and have begun to gain
weight and height. Before treatment their growth had been very
poor in comparison to normal children of the same age," the
study, conducted by Doctors Michael Hershfield and Rebecca
Buckley, said.
    The PEG-ADA injections were given once a week. Victims of
the disease have traditionally been treated by bone marrow
transplants, but for most, donors are not available or
transplantation is unsuccessful, the company said. Other
diseases caused by a missing enzyme might also be treated by
introducing a PEG coated enzyme, the article noted.

Congressional ire is rising against
the multinational development banks which make loans to help
other countries produce goods in direct competition with
beleagured U.S. farmers and miners.
    With a record U.S. trade deficit of 169 billion dlrs last
year and a farm economy in the doldrums, Congress is pressing
to hold back U.S. funds for the World Bank and other
development banks if the money is used to subsidize production
or to produce goods already in oversupply around the world.
     "American tax dollars are being used to subsidize foreign
agriculture and mineral production that is often in direct
competition with our producers," Senator Don Nickles, an
Oklahoma Republican, said in a letter to fellow senators
seeking support for his legislation to limit these loans.
    Nickles and Senator Steven Symms, a conservative Republican
from Idaho, have introduced legislation that would strictly
limit U.S. funding of multinational development banks if they
make any loans to help developing countries produce surplus
commodities or minerals.
    Current law requires that the United States vote against
such loans but carries no reprisals if they are ultimately
approved by the banks.
    Treasury Secretary James Baker's assurances that U.S.
policy is to oppose these loans did not satisfy concerns raised
at two Senate committee hearings last week.
    Baker told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee on Foreign
Operations, "As a policy matter, we oppose loans for production
of commodities in oversupply."
    The senators cited a 350-mln-dlr World Bank loan made to
Argentina last year to help it increase its agricultural
exports by one billion dlrs a year by 1989.
    Nickles, Symms and others also have cited other loans such
as a 1985 World Bank loan to Hungary to expand livestock
exports and 500 mln dlrs lent to Thailand from 1981 to 1985 at
low interest rates for agriculture.
    Last year the Republican-controlled Senate voted three
times over the objections of the administration to cut U.S.
funding of development banks by the amount of these loans.
    But even with a 65 to 15 vote in favour of the proposal,
the restrictions were weakened in the final version. Only a
provision directing U.S. officials to vote disapproval cleared
Congress.
    This year's version, called the Foreign Agricultural
Investment Reform (FAIR) Act would require the U.S. to vote
against loans designed to increase production of surplus
commodities and minerals. Also, the recipient countries would
have to prove that the production, marketing and export of the
commodities could be handled without government subsidy.
    If the loan is approved over U.S. objections, the United
States would not increase or replenish funds for that
institution until it agrees to stop making such loans.
    Objections to such loans have most often been raised by
conservative Republicans who have traditionally opposed U.S.
funding for these international development banks.
    But the loss of many jobs to foreign competition has raised
similar concerns among more moderate senators.
    The administration opposes any legislation that would tie
its hands in votes on the loans. It argues there might be
instances in which a country needed the money to continue its
moves toward U.S. policies in other areas.
    Baker said the United States would continue to use its
leverage in the banks to require foreign trade liberalization
measures, often in the form of elimination of subsidies.
    Two House Republicans, Representatives Larry Craig of Idaho
and Beau Bolter of Texas, have introduced the bill. But it
faces stiff opposition in the House Banking Committee which has
blocked its consideration by the House in the past.
    Symms intends to offer the bill as an amendment to any
related legislation this year, an aide said.

MCI Communications Corp. called for
immediate federal deregulation of American Telephone and
Telegraph Co., its principal competitor.
    MCI said it will ask the Federal Communications Commission
tomarrow to deregulate ATT in order to let marketplace forces
govern the long distance telephone market.
    "It's time to let the market manage ATT," MCI president Bert
Roberts told a news briefing here.
    MCI has seen its profits shaved recently by ATT long
distance rate reductions ordered by the FCC following the
breakup of the Bell System.
    The MCI move signals its belief that ATT may raise profits
rather than cut rates if deregulated.
    To allay consumers' fears that deregulation might lead to
price increases, Roberts said one alternative open to the FCC
would be adoption of a transitional "price cap" concept.
    Roberts noted that such a plan is backed by FCC
commissioner Dennis Patrick, whose is widely expected to be
named FCC chairman.
    Roberts conceded that ATT's deregulation posed risks to
MCI.
    "The greater risk, however, is continuing the artificial
market environment created by piecemeal FCC deregulation of
ATT."

Western Canada's resource-based economy
is being hurt by international market forces and there is

said.
    "If you can tell me how we can get the international energy
price up and how we can get the price for copper up and how we
can get the price for wheat up, then we will listen," Wilson
told the House of Comnons Finance Committee.
    Although under pressure from oil companies and wheat
farmers for help in battling depressed commodity prices, Wilson
said it has to be recognized the area was a "prisoner of market
forces outside the boundaries of this country."
    Wilson, appearing before the committee to discuss the
government's spending estimates released earlier this week,
said the government is doing what it can in the region, citing
more than 3.5 billion dlrs in aid for western agriculture.
    "Those resources are a reflection of very real concerns on
our part in dealing with a very difficult problem," Wilson said
in response to questions about management of the economy from
opposition party members.
    He said the long term answer for depressed regions of the

    Trading in Morton-Thiokol stock opened up 4-1/4 at 50 on
turnover of 122,700 shares after
a delayed opening due to an imbalance of orders.
    There are certain funds which base their portfolio on the

reflects those managers adding shares of Morton-Thiokol,
Standard and Poor's said.

noting that it brings in new buyers for the shares and gives

French official reserves fell 45.06
billion francs to 375.95 billion at the end of January from
421.00 billion at the end of December, the Finance Ministry
said in a statement.
    It said the fall was largely due to sales of foreign
currency that preceded the January 11 realignment of the
European Monetary System (EMS).
    Foreign currency reserves fell by 8.91 billion francs
during the month, the ministry said.
    This reflected outflows of 10.26 billion francs through
operations of the French exchange stabilisation fund,
counterbalanced by a gain of 1.35 billion francs resulting from
the quarterly adjustment in the value of dollar deposits held
with the European Monetary Cooperation Fund (FECOM).
    But most of the decline reflected a 33.90 billion franc
deficit that France built up during the month with FECOM as a
result of using very short-term financing instruments.
    The Bank of France, in conjunction with the Bundesbank and
other central banks, intervened heavily in foreign exchange
markets between late December and the January 11 EMS accord, in
an attempt to hold down the mark, which was attracting a flight
of funds from the dollar, and simultaneously shore up the
franc.
    On January 11, the mark was revalued by three pct against
the French franc, relieving pressure on the French currency.
    The fall in foreign exchange reserves took these reserves
to 98.83 billion francs at the end of January from 107.74
billion at end December.
    Gold reserves were unchanged at 218.45 billion francs.
    Reserves of European Currency Units fell to 73.25 billion
francs from 75.27 billion at end December.

Securities and Exchange Commission
chairman John Shad said progress was being made in stopping
insider trading, but the chairman of a House subcommittee with
jurisdiction over securities laws said he was concerned about
conditions on Wall Street.
    "Greed has created a feeding frenzy on Wall Street and in
the process laws are broken and multi-billion dlr corporations
have become easy prey," Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass, the
chairman of the Telecommunications and Finance said at the
start of a hearing on SEC activities.
    "Congress is understandably nervous. We perceive the
current scandals as a warning of even worse things to come,"
Markey said. "The frenzy and disruption created by merger mania
is particularly distressing."
    Shad said the recent cases involving Ivan Boesky, Dennis
Levine and others was a warning that those who engage in
insider trading were taking a heavy risk of imprisonment, high
fines and disbarment from the securities industry.
    "Insider trading has not been eradicated, but it has been
inhibited and multimillions of dollars of profits that Boesky
and others have been siphoning off the markets are now flowing
through to legitimate investors and traders," Shad said in his
statement.
    Shad said insider trading cases involved only 10 pct or
less of SEC enforcement actions in recent years but they have
increased significantly to 125 cases brought during the past
five years compared to 77 cases in the preceeding 47 years.
    Markey said he did not favor banning takeovers but thought

The U.S. Department of Transportation
said it gave final approval to USAir Group's proposed 400 mln
dlr acquisition of Pacific Southwest Airlines.
    The department said the acquisition is not likely to
substantially lessen competition and would not harm the public
interest.
    The department had given its tentative approval of the
acquisition in January.
    The department said it decided to make final its tentative
decision after reviewing the public response to it.
    The agency said it rejected an assertion by Air North
America, which currently is not operating but plans to start
service to some of the cities served by USAIR and PSA, that the
acquisition would lessen chances of new entry into those
markets by other carriers.
    The agency said Air North America provided no support for
its claim that the transaction would give the two carriers
monopoly power in some markets.
    The transportation agency said Air North America also
failed to show that there are barriers that would prevent new
entrants into those markets or prevent other carriers from
increasing their service.
    The agency noted in its final order that PSA operates
exclusively in the West and Mexico while USAir serves the West
for the most part with some long-haul flights from the East and
Midwest.
    The two carriers serve five point in common; Los Angeles,
San Diego, San Francico, Phoenix and Tucsonm, the agency said.
     The transportation department also rejected a request by
the Teamsters Union, which represents some PSA workers, to
require protections for PSA workers.
    The agency noted that USAir has promised to give protective
benefits to PSA workers and that unions representing PSA
workers have collective bargaining agreements that provide such
protections.

Texas Democrat told reporters before the opening of the House
session.
    Wright said the Democrats intended to make the additional
tax burden fairer than was Reagan's plan for 22 billion dlrs in
additional revenues in the 1988 budget.
    "It's not a question of whether new revenue is needed, it's
a question of who has to pay," Wright said.

Reagan's budget which would raise fees on medicare recipients,
tax black lung benefits and reduce tax breaks for home
purchases.
    Wright has sought to delay the 1988 income tax rate cut but
has said other options such as a tax on securities transfers
were merely floated as possible deficit reduction alternatives.

A study of salmonella poisoning has
uncovered new evidence that the common practice of feeding
antibiotics to cattle is helping to create deadly bacteria that
can infect humans and resist medicines.
    Researchers at the federal Centers for Disease Control
tracked the spread of an unusual strain of salmonella that is
resistant to the drug chloramphenicol and were able to link the
resulting food poisoning to farms that used the drug to promote
the growth of cattle.
    Cattlemen often give their animals a constant supply of
antibiotics in feed to help them grow faster. But critics have
been warning for years that the constant exposure to the drugs
is helping bacteria learn to resist the drugs.
    Industry officials have disputed this, saying the diseases
that develop a resistance in cattle probably do not affect
humans.
    But the new study, reported in Thursday's New England
Journal of Medicine, shows the diseases can spread to humans.
    The research team, led by Dr. John Spika, said the number
of people who have developed the chloramphenicol-resistant
infection in Los Angeles County alone jumped from 69 in 1984 to
298 the following year. Two of those victims died and half the
victims in their study of 45 patients had to be hospitalized
for their illness.
    They also discovered that cooking the meat didn't always
prevent the disease. Only 15 pct of the victims reported eating
raw, infected hamburger. Thus, the researchers concluded, "the
majority of cases appear to have been caused by eating
hamburger that was at least partially cooked."
    The researchers said the results show that "food animals are
a major source of antimicrobial-resistant salmonella infections
in humans, and that these infections are associated with
(antibiotic) use on farms."

The National Farmers Union, NFU, remains
concerned about the future ownership of British Sugar despite
last week's decision by the government to block bids from
Italy's Gruppo Ferruzzi and Britain's Tate & Lyle Plc.
    The union's sugar beet committee met yesterday to consider
the implications of a government Monopolies and Merger
Commission, MMC, report issued last week. "We are still
concerned about S and W Berisford being long-term owners of
British Sugar," a spokesman said. "We do not view Berisford as
providing the long-term stability we want."
    The Trade and Industry Secretary accepted a recommendation
last week by the MMC that it block a bid by Tate and Lyle for S
and W Berisford Plc and stop Gruppo Ferruzzi buying a majority
of British Sugar, owned by Berisford.
    Union officials believe a new bid for the monopoly beet
processor is now likely. "We are looking again at the
undertakings that we have demanded of existing bidders and
which we would seek of any future bidders," the spokesman said.
The NFU, which represents Britain's 11,500 sugar beet growers,
is also taking legal advice on particular paragraphs in the MMC
report which it says need further explanation.

<Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce>,
earlier reporting higher net income for the first quarter ended
January 31, said it expects loan losses to be lower than last
year's 697.0 mln dlrs.
    However, the bank said it will maintain the high level of
provisioning for loan losses established last year because of
many market uncertainties. Commerce bank set loan loss
provisions of 636.0 mln dlrs in fiscal 1986, ended October 31.
    The bank earlier said first quarter net income rose to 96.5
mln dlrs from 87.0 mln dlrs in the prior year. Profit per basic
share after dividends fell to 61 cts from year-ago 64 cts.
    Commerce Bank said because of market uncertainties, it used
an estimate of 600.0 mln dlrs for fiscal 1987 loan losses in
calculating first quarter results.
    The bank's first quarter provision for loan losses rose to
172.0 mln dlrs, from 152.0 mln dlrs in the prior year.
    Commerce Bank also said it will continue to adopt an
agressive posture in adding to its general provisions against
loan exposure to 34 countries designated by the federal
government's Inspector General of Banks.
    First quarter net partly benefitted from net interest
income, up to 561.8 mln dlrs from year ago 540.9 mln dlrs.
    Commerce Bank said improved other income, which rose to
213.6 mln dlrs from year-earlier 170.1 mln dlrs, and net income
was partially offset by the increased loan loss provisions,
non-interest expenses and income taxes.
    The bank said first quarter total assets increased to 83.92
billion dlrs from 78.93 mln dlrs in the prior year, due mainly
to continued expansion in consumer loan and mortgage fields.
    Return on assets increased by two cts to 46 cts per 100
dlrs of average assets from the first quarter in fiscal 1986,
but declined two cts from fiscal 1986 fourth quarter.
    The bank also said total non-accrual loans increased to 2.4
billion dlrs in the first quarter from year-ago 1.8 billion
dlrs. However, non-accrual loans declined 130 mln dlrs from
fiscal 1986 year-end.
    "Despite the recent announcement of the suspension of
interest payments by Brazil, virtually all of the bank's loans
to this country were income producing up to January 31, 1987,
and there was little adverse impact on the bank's earnings
prior to the announcement," Commerce bank said.
    The bank did not disclose a forecast of the impact on
future earnings by Brazil's suspension of interest payments.

eradication of the disease within 116 hog herds. The project

use program.
    The program would establish better relationships between
producers and veterinarians and eventually lead to a quality
assurance program in pork production, according to the plan.
    "This program basically communicates to the FDA that we are
concerned about safe drug use and will do our part to use drugs
safely, if FDA will allow the same policy to continue in
effect," Wehler said.

The Bank of England again fought against
money and bond market pressure for a pre-Budget interest rate
cut, leaving the pound to take the strain with a further rise
in its trade-weighted index to a six-month high.
    It closed at its best level since September 12, at 71.4 pct
of its 1975 value on the index, as foreign investors continued
to buy into a currency which offers high relative returns and
the possibility of short-term capital gains, dealers said.
    Meanwhile, opinion is divided over whether the Bank can
stop a cut before Budget Day, March 17, and why it should want
to.
    The Bank's latest strong signal to the market that it wants
rates to stay steady for the moment came in midafternoon, when
it lent to the discount houses at a penal rate of 11-3/4 pct to
relieve a money market shortage.
    "They're really making the discount houses suffer," said
Stephen Lewis, economist at brokerage house Phillips and Drew.
"Eleven and three-quarters pct is way above money market rates."
    This money market signal was apparently not accompanied by
any sterling sales on the foreign exchanges, talk of which had
inhibited strong rises yesterday and Tuesday, so buyers came
strongly into the pound.
    The pound surged to a high of 1.5798/808 dlrs at the London
close, up from the previous finish at 1.5650/60, and 2.8900/60
marks, up from 2.8720/50.
    "If this pressure keeps up...There is a possibility that
rates could drop before the Budget," said Jeremy Hale, economist
at finance house Goldman Sachs International Corp.
    Some gilt traders are forecasting a half-point cut in the
base rate from the current 11 pct as early as tomorrow.
    However, analysts said the Bank of England will need to be
convinced that the present rise is a fundamental re-rating
rather than a result of short-term speculative gains.
    There are valid reasons for the Bank to be cautious, said
Peter Fellner, U.K. Economist at brokers James Capel and Co.
    Markets have become highly optimistic about the chances of
a Conservative Party victory in any early general election, and
disappointment if Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher decides to
hold back could lead to a decline in the pound and a setback
for bonds, Fellner said.
    An election could be delayed until mid-1988, but most
forecasts say it will be this year.
    Others note that the pound could yet prove vulnerable to
oil price losses or a change of fortune for the dollar.
    However, analysts agree the Bank is largely trying to set
the timing of a cut than holding out against one altogether.
    The authorities traditionally prefer a single sustainable
rate move, one way or the other, to half points here and there.
    Some add the Bank will be influenced by signs that at least
a proportion of the latest bout of sterling buying is long-term
capital coming into the London market, notably from Japan.
    They argue that the pound is being perceived as a safer bet
than the dollar, given the latters recent sharp falls and
current political upheavals in Washington.
    The Bank may want to see another few points on the
trade-weighted index before the Budget, argued Lewis. "But by
then sterling should be firm enough to satisfy even the Bank of
England," he added.
    The Bank declined to comment on its reasons for resisting
pressure for a rate move before the budget, but banking sources
said the authorities see the recent rise in sterling as more
than just marking up by foreign exchange traders.
    Meanwhile, analysts noted the market ignored potentially
harmful news on the trade front, today's figures showing that
the current account deficit in 1986 was 1.1 billion stg.
    This was above previous estimates of the current account
deficit and compares with a surplus of 2.9 billion stg in 1985.
    Fellner said that under more normal conditions this would
have given the bond and currency markets a pause, but that they
were too bullish to worry about such fundamentals.
    The guessing game over the timing of a cut has the clearing
banks divided as well as the markets. Privately, some bank
officials forecast the Bank will hold out at least for this
week, but at least one bank says a rise is possible tomorrow.
If a move comes before March 17, forecasts are for a half-point
cut, with another half or full point about Budget day.

    "We favor shortening the disclosure period to two days,"
Shad told members of the House Telecommunications and Finance
subcommittee when asked for his recommendation.
    He said the SEC's responsibility was to provide full
disclosure for securities, including junk bonds, and not to
make decisions based on merit. He said junk bonds had some
value because of their liquidity.
    Shad said he opposes proposals to require those attempting
takeovers to file a statement on the impact the takeover would
have on the communities involved.
    "We've opposed it in the past. It goes far beyond investor

Hughes Tool Co Chairman W.A. Kistler
said its counter proposal to merge with Baker International
Corp was still under consideration and that a merger was in the
best interests of both companies.
    "Our hope is that we can come to a mutual agreement that is
good for both companies," Kistler said of the proposed merger
that would result in a 1.2 billion dlr oil field service
company. "We're working very hard on this merger."
    Hughes' board today again adjourned a shareholders meeting
to vote on the proposed merger and rescheduled it for March 11
to give Baker more time to consider the counter proposal.
    The Hughes board, which had previously expressed concern
about a U.S. Department of Justice consent decree that would
require Baker to sell its drilling bit operations and
submersible pump business, met yesterday and threatened to
terminate the proposed merger.
    The Hughes board made a counter proposal that the two
companies first find acceptable buyers for the businesses
before signing the decree.
    The directors of Baker immediately after receiving the
counter proposal filed a law suit in Texas in a Texas state
court to force to Hughes to complete the merger.
    "The uncertainty as to the price and conditions that might
be imposed by the Department of Justice makes us very nervous
about what the outcome might be," Kistler said, in explaining
why Hughes had made the counter proposal.
    "We need additional time to understand why Baker did not
accept our proposal."
    Kistler also said that the law suit filed by Baker "was not
a factor" in the board's decision to keep its merger proposal
on the table.
    He declined to comment on the allegations in the lawsuit.
    Kistler said Hughes would be willing to consider a
compromise counter proposal, but declined to be more specific.
    The Justice Department in January said it would block the
Hughes and Baker merger on anti-trust grounds unless both
companies agreed to sign a consent decree that would provide
for the sale of the assets after the merger took place.
    The Hughes board said it would not sign the decree because
its was too "unreasonable." Hughes said that Baker should
instead complete the sale of the disputed assets before the
merger is finalized and given government approval.
    Under the decree, if Baker is unable to find acceptable
buyers within a specified period of time after the decree is
approved, a federal trustee would become responsible for
finding a buyer.
    Kistler said that under those terms, the trustee could take
up to 10 years to complete the sales.
    He also expressed concern that the combined companies might
be required by the government's conditions to license some of
its technology to any purchaser of the assets.
    Baker said last night in a statement that the required
assets to be sold would reduce revenues by about 65 mln dlrs,
representing about three pct of the revenues of the combined
companies.

U.S. retailers posted stronger than
expected sales in February, but not enough to prompt analysts
to change their expectations of sluggish sales growth for the
first half of 1987.
     "My feeling is that it (February) borrowed some of the
business we normally see later in the quarter and the real
strength of general merchandise sales will be in the second
half of 1987," said Bear Stearns and Co analyst Monroe
Greenstein.
    "I don't think March will be as strong because Easter falls
in April this year," said Morgan Stanley analyst Walter Loeb.
   Analysts generally average the sales results of March and
April to account for the variation of Easter's occurrence.
    Analyst Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook Associates said
sales for February rose between six and 6.5 pct, compared to a
3.6 pct increase last year.
     Analysts noted that February is considered a small,
transitory month between winter and spring.
    In addition, sales comparisons were boosted by an
especially soft February last year which was adversely affected
by severe weather.
    Apparel sales outshone other product groups in sales,
according to retailers and analysts.
    "February's strong sales reflected a lot of fresh
merchandise on the shelves and higher consumer income due to
tax reductions," said Greenstein of Bear Stearns.
    Analysts expect apparel sales to remain good as sales of
durable and houseware items grow softer due to the continuing
high levels of consumer debt.
     May Department Stores Co <MAY> and K Mart Corp <KM> were
among the strong performers, posting comparable store sales
gains of 9.4 pct and 8.2 pct, respectively. May had an overall
sales gain of 15.0 pct and K Mart had a 13.1 pct sales gain 
last month.
    "Favorable consumer response to our merchandise programs
continued to positively impact our sales comparisons. IN
addition to the strong contribution by K Mart stores, all our
specialty retailing companies had excellent February sales,"
said K Mart chairman Bernard Fauber.
    Sears Roebuck and Co <S> posted a 4.9 pct increase.
"Domestic sales were led by better than average increases in
apparel, home fashions and hardware and especially strong
catalog sales," said Sears chairman Edward Brennan.
    Analysts were a little disappointed by J.C. Penney Co Inc
<JCP> which started out with especially strong sales early in
the month. Penney posted a 5.5 pct increase on a comparitive
store basis and a 5.3 pct gain in overall sales.
    Penney chairman William Howell said, "store sales were
strongest during the early part of the month, while catalog
demand was consistently strong throughout the period.
    Store sales activity varied throughout the country, ranging
from good in the East to weak in the depressed southwest.
    Analysts also said gross profit margins were high as
retailers were not overly promotional due to leaner inventories
than a year ago.
    "February is not a big month seasonally but these numbers
suggest a fairly good trend for consumer spending," said Drexel
Burnham Lambert analyst Jeff Edelman.

Federal Reserve Board Vice Chairman
Manuel Johnson said that maintaining price stability was
critical to achieving non-inflationary economic growth in the
world and said that progress was being made.
    "It is worth reiterating that the Federal Reserve's
promotion of price stability is critical to the successful
implementation of virtually all of the important ingredients
for growth," he told the Eastern Economic Association.
    Johnson said initial progress has been made on a variety of
fronts. "Federal Reserve monetary policy, the
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings legislation, the G-6 agreement, and the
Baker debt initiative for example all have moved us in the
right direction," he said. G-6 is comprised of U.S., Britain,
France, Japan, West Germany and Canada.
    On the budget deficit, Johnson said meeting precise
numerical goals was less important than a continuing commitment
toward slowing the growth of federal spending.
    There was evidence deficits as a pct of Gross National
Product were declining and would continue to drop, he said.
    But Johnson warned against reliance on inflow of foreign
capital to finance investment and the budget deficit and keep
interest rates stable.
    "This situation, however, cannot continue indefinitely.
Sooner or later progress must be made in controlling excessive
federal spending," he said.
    A disinflationary monetary policy should continue to be the
main objective of the Fed, Johnson said.
    He also said a more stable and sustainable alignment of
exchange rates was needed for long-term growth.
    On the trade deficit, Johnson warned against "quick fix"
solutions, which he identified as excessive dollar depreciation
or protectionist trade legislation.
    "What is important is that we attempt to maintain healthy
returns to capital and adopt policies encouraging genuine
economic growth," he said.
    Such an approach would finance the trade deficit but allow
for its gradual resolution over time.

The Reagan administration soon will
propose a program of no-fault compensation for people injured
by childhood vaccines, a senior Treasury Department counsel
told the House select revenue measures subcommittee.
    "Within the next few weeks, we expect to propose a program
that will provide equitable, no-fault compensation to injured
persons, and predictable (and hence insurable) liabilities for
vaccine manufacturers," Dennis Ross, tax legislative counsel for
treasury, said in prepared testimony.
    The Vaccine Act was signed into law last year but did not
include a funding mechanism for its compensation program.
    Ross noted 50 to 75 children a year suffer serious
long-term or injuries from adverse reactions to vaccine for
diptheria, tetanus and whooping cough alone.
    But he said lawsuits were causing drug companies like Wyeth
Laboratories and Parke, Davis and Co to stop producing
childhood vaccines.
    The administration would not favor funding compensation
through an excise tax levied on the vaccine producers because
it would add to collection and auditing burdens, Ross said.
    He did not suggest a favored funding mechanism but said
a lump-sum trust fund for compensation might be preferable.

Imperial Chemical Industries PLC
expects earnings from its pharmaceuticals operations to grow  
to about 35 pct of world profits within the next five years
compared with a current 30 pct, chairman elect Denys Henderson
told financial analysts.
    "Over the next five years we expect to launch one major new
product each year," Henderson said.
    He also said research and development spending in this
business segment will be increased to 14 pct of total sales
income in 1987 from 13 pct, or 130 mln sterling, in 1986.
    ICI, the world's fifth largest chemicals firm in terms of
sales, recently reported 1986 profits of about 888 mln dlrs on
15 billion dlrs in sales, compared with income of 817 mln dlrs
on 15.87 billion dlrs in sales a year earlier.
    Sales in the United States totaled about three billion
dlrs, ICI executives said.
    In addition, Henderson said overall corporate growth will
come from ICI's research and development activities, but the
company intends to continue to grow through an acquisition
program.
    ICI spent just under one billion dlrs for acquisitions
during 1986, the largest of which was the 580 mln dlr purchase
of Cleveland, Ohio-based Glidden Inc, a paints, resins and
coatings company, from <Hanson Trust PLC>.
    ICI financial director Alan Clements said the company's
borrowing limits are at a level of about 6.3 billion sterling,

warned that a breakdown of the renegotiation process could be
harmful.
    "There have been some difficulties in those negotiations ...
banks have sometimes been too rigid," Johnson said in response

    "I think there have been potential breakdowns in that

unfortunate."
    He declined to comment on the situation of specific nations
and said it was not the Fed's role to become involved in such
talks.
    However, he said it was "always a little bit risky" for a
heavily indebted nation to seek refinancing without first
negotiating with the International Monetary Fund on economic
reforms. He added that he remains optimistic that current talks
would be resolved successfully.

Tandem Computers Inc said it expects
higher earnings and revenues in its second fiscal quarter
ending March 31 against a year ago.
    "We feel we will continue to see higher growth in the
quarter," James Treybig, president and and chief executive
officer, told a meeting of securities analysts.
    In the second fiscal quarter last year, Tandem earned
9,950,000 dlrs or 29 cts per share on revenues of 176.3 mln
dlrs.
    Treybig declined to offer specific projections for the
quarter but he said the results might be lower than those for
the first quarter of fiscal 1987, when Tandem earned 27.1 mln
dlrs or 58 cts a share. He said Tandem's second quarter is
traditionally slower than the first.
    L.F. Rothschild Unterberg Towbin analyst Frederic Cohen
estimated Tandem's second quarter net at 40 to 45 cts per
share. For the full year, he said he expects the computer maker
to earn about 2.40 dlrs a share. In fiscal 1986, Tandem earned
1.44 dlrs a share.
    Treybig, who founded the Cupertino, Calif.-based company,
said he has seen a rebound in computer orders in the United
States. "The U.S. economy is picking up, and buying decisions
are being made. We didn't see that a year ago," he said.
    The executive said Tandem will increase its research and
development spending to about 100 mln dlrs this year from 87
mln dlrs in fiscal 1986.
    He said the company plans to introduce several products,
including two low-end systems and a data base that uses the SQL
programming language, an industry standard. Tandem also won a
major order from the <Bank of Tokyo>.

A House Agriculture Committee meeting
later today to draft a disaster aid bill is expected to spark a
debate between lawmakers who want to expand the 0/92, or
"de-coupling," provision to cover feedgrains, and those who
oppose 0/92 or want it severely limited, Congressional sources
said.
    The disaster aid bill as it now stands calls for a one-year
0/92 pilot program for 1987 crop wheat and the 1988 winter
wheat crop. The bill would allow farmers to forego planting and
still receive 92 pct of deficiency payments.
    The administration has strongly urged that the bill be
expanded to feedgrains and to more than one year.
    It is difficult to tell in what form the 0/92 provision
will emerge from the committee, the sources said.
    Proponents of an expansion of 0/92 maintain there are large
estimated cost savings of such a bill -- ranging from estimates
by the administration of 200 to 500 mln dlrs.
    Opposition to a reopening of the 1985 farm bill at this
time is the major reason cited by those against an expansion of
the bill, committee staffers said.
    The 0/92 plan is scheduled to be discussed at 1530 EST. A
conflicting floor vote delayed the start of the meeting, and
staffers said it may have to be delayed even until next week.
    Such a delay would not bode well for proponents of an
expanded 0/92 program, since spring planting in many areas of
the country will be underway in the next few weeks and signup
for the 1987 wheat and feedgrains program ends March 30.
    Farmers are now making their planting decisions, so
something has to be done quickly if a 0/92 program is to be
implemented, an Agriculture Department source said.
    An expansion of 0/92 to feedgrains was opposed in last
week's subcommittee hearing on the bill, with subcommittee
chairman Dan Glickman, D-Kan., saying that more study of the
consequences of decoupling on feedgrains plantings was
necessary.
    Major commodity groups, including the National Corn
Growers, the American Farm Bureau and the National Cattlemen's
Association, have voiced strong opposition to 0/92.
    But proponents of an expanded 0/92 argue that the bill
currently is not equitable for all grains producers, so it
should be extended to other crops.
    There will be difficulty in limiting 0/92 to wheat, said
Gene Moos, aide to house majority leader Tom Foley, D-Wash.
    Projected cost savings, in the current atmosphere of try to
decrease farm expenditures, would also be hard to ignore in the
debate to expand the 0/92 application, Moos said.
    Rep. Charles Stenholm, D-Tex., may be planning to introduce
a bill to restrict 0/92 to only 1987 crop wheat, with the
argument that now is not the time to vote in favor of any major
changes in the farm bill.
    "Stenholm's bill is not a rejection of 0/92, only of the
timing," a congressional staff member said.
    Rep. Arland Stangeland (R-Minn.) is reported to have an
amendment to expand the 0/92 provision to 1987 and 1988
feedgrains.

Carl Icahn's bold takeover bid for
USAir Group <U> has clouded the fate of Piedmont Aviation Inc,
which was being courted by USAir.
    Yesterday, Icahn's Transworld Airlines Inc <TWA> made a 1.4
billion dlr offer for USAir Group. The move complicated a USAir
takeover offer for Piedmont, which was believed to be close to
accepting the bid.
    Today, USAir rejected Icahn's 52 dlr per share offer and
said the bid was a last-minute effort to interfere in its
takeover of Piedmont. Icahn was unavailable for comment.
    Piedmont fell one to 68-5/8 on volume of 963,000. TWA was
off 3/8 to 31-1/2. USAir fell 1-3/8 to 47-3/4 as doubt spread
it would be taken over.
    Analysts and market sources view the TWA bid as an attempt
to either trigger a counter offer from USAir or to attract a
suitor who might want both airlines once they merged.
   "The next move is either Icahn starts a tender offer or
Piedmont and USAir announce a deal," speculated one arbitrager.
    Some arbitragers said there is now some risk in the current
price of Piedmont since it is not clear that USAir's bid will
succeed.
    Piedmont's largest shareholder and other suitor, Norfolk
Southern Corp <NSC> has offered 65 dlrs per share for the
company. USAir offered 71 dlrs cash per share for half of
Piedmont stock, and 73 dlrs per share in stock for the balance.
    Some arbitragers, however, believe the depressed price of
Piedmont offers a buying opportunity since the airline is
destined to be acquired by someone. USAir, they said, is the
least likely to be bought.
    Icahn, who has long talked about further consolidation in
the airline industry, also offered USAir the alternative of a
three-way airline combination, including TWA and Piedmont.
    But Wall Street has given little credibility to Icahn's
offer, which lacked financing and was riddled with
contingencies.
    Still, he has succeeded in holding up a merger of two
airlines - both of which analysts said would fit well with TWA.
    "You can't discount him," said one arbitrager.
    Analysts, however, said Icahn would have to prove he is
serious by following through with his threats or making a new
offer. In making the offer for USAir, Icahn threatened to go
directly to shareholders for 51 pct of the stock at a lower
price if USAir rejected his offer.
    "It's clear Icahn wants to sell and he's bluffing," said
one arbitrager.
    Analysts said the 52 dlr per share offer was underpriced by
about six dlrs per share.
    Some analysts believe Icahn's proposed three-way airline
combination might face insurmountable regulatory hurdles, but
others believe it could be cleared if the companies are
acquired separately.
    "TWA would have to be the surviving company for the deal to
work," said one analyst.
    Analysts said such a merger would be costly and
complicated. TWA has the best cost structure, since Icahn
succeeded in winning concessions from its unions.
    In order for the other carriers to come down to TWA's wage
scale in a merger, TWA would have to be the surviving entity,
analysts said.
    Such a move does not necessarily free Icahn of TWA, they
said. They said he showed skill in reducing Ozark Airlines'
costs when he merged it into TWA last year, and he might be a
necessary ingredient for a merger to work.
    However, other analysts speculated the managements of
Piedmont and USAir would not tolerate Icahn as head of a new
company. They said a USAir acquisition of TWA might be a way
for him to exit the company if USAir's airline is then merged
into TWA.

Union Carbide Corp said its 1986
long term debt was 3.06 billion dlrs compared to 1.71 billion
dlrs in 1985.
    The company released its audited 1986 results.
    The company also said its long term debt was reduced by
about 1.5 billion dlrs from the third quarter to the end of the
year by asset sales and equity offerings. Union Carbide sold
its battery products, home and automobile products and
agricultural products businesses in 1986. In the fourth
quarter, it offered 30 mln shares of stock, raising about 650
mln dlrs.
    The asset sales and equity offering were part of a
recapitalization plan undertaken by the chemicals company last
year.
    Audited net earnings in 1986 of 496 mln dlrs or 4.78 dlrs a
share compared to a 1985 loss of 581 mln dlrs or 2.78 dlrs were
unchanged from the company's preliminary earnings report made
on Jan 28. The earnings results for the fourth quarter were
also unchanged.
    Included in the 1986 numbers are a 564 mln dlr gain from
sale of the different businesses, a 270 mln dlr pension credit
and a charge of 473 mln dlrs from the purchase of long term
debt at a premium under the recapitalization.
    In the audited results released today, the company broke
down results by business segment.
    Operating profit in the fourth quarter for all of the
company's operations on a consolidated basis, before corporate
and interest expense and taxes, was 181 mln dlrs against a loss
of three mln dlrs in the 1985 quarter.
    In the year, operating profit was 791 mln dlrs compared to
a loss of 253 mln dlrs in 1985.
    In a statement, the company said it defeated a hostile
takeover attempt, by GAF Corp <GAF>, and recapitalized the
company, adding, "While all this was going on, our continuing
businesses performed very soundly, with substantial operating
profit improvement over 1985."
    Carbon products posted operating profit of eight mln dlrs
in the quarter, down from 29 mln dlrs, and 49 mln dlrs in the
year against a loss of 146 mln dlrs.
    Chemicals and plastics had fourth quarter operating profit
of 122 mln dlrs compared to a year-ago loss of 49 mln dlrs. In
the year, chemicals and plastics earned 472 mln dlrs against
losses of 142 mln dlrs in 1985.
    Operating income at industrial gases rose to 64 mln dlrs
from 55 mln in the quarter and to 276 mln dlrs from 222 mln in
the year.
    The company's specialties and services segment cut its
losses in the quarter to 13 mln dlrs from 40 mln dlrs and in
the year to three mln dlrs from 181 mln dlrs.
    Eliminations of business conducted between the company's
industry segments contributed two mln dlrs to fourth quarter
1985 profits but did not affect the 1986 quarter. The
eliminations caused losses of three mln dlrs compared to six
mln dlrs in the year.
    The 1985 operating results include a host of unusual
writeoffs and depreciation charges totaling 134 mln dlrs in the
quarter and 906 mln dlrs in the year.
    Capital expenditures rose to 524 mln dlrs in 1986 from 501
mln dlrs.
    By segment, spending at carbon products fell to 42 mln dlrs
from 57 mln dlrs and spending fell at specialties and services
to 126 mln dlrs from 143 mln dlrs.
    At chemicals and plastics, expenditures rose to 147 mln
dlrs from 133 mln and at industrial gases they rose to 209 mln
dlrs from 168 mln dlrs.
    The company's cash and equivalents fell to 299 mln dlrs at
year end from 430 mln dlrs at year end 1985, after a net
decrease of 131 mln dlrs during 1986.
    Current assets at year-end fell to 2.41 billion dlrs from

    Humana said it is now aware of any effort to gain control

right entitles holders to purchase securities of the company or
an acquiring entity having a market value of twice the right's

period. It also put out an alternative policy statement by
Commissioner Charles Stalon.
    FERC said in a press release that "the proposed policy
statement estblishes an exception to the commission's general
policy that take-or-pay buy-out and buy-down costs must be
recovered through pipeline' commodity sales rates."
    FERC added that "specifically, in cases where pipelines
assume an equitable share of buy-out or buy-down costs, the
commission proposes to permit the pipelines to recover the
remaining costs through their demand rates."
    It said it wanted guidelines for buying out and reforming
existing contracts to help spread the impact of these
take-or-pay costs in a responsible, fair and equitable way.
    Commission chairwoman Martha Hesse said "this proposal
represents the commission's sincere attempt to help the
industry through this difficult period of transition to a more
competitive market."
    Hesse said "it is my hope that our proposed policy will
encourage and guide the timely resolution of take-or-pay

ChemLawn Corp said its board
rejected Waste Management Inc's 27 dlr-per-share tender offer
and urged its shareholders not to tender their shares.
    ChemLawn said its board asked management and its financial
advisor, Smith Barney, Harris Upham And Co Inc, to seek other
purchasers of the company to maximize shareholder value.
    ChemLawn also said it adopted a shareholder rights plan, or
"poison pill," during a 120-intermin safeguard period its board
adopted to deter attempts to acquire the company through any
means other than an all-cash tender offer while it seeks other
purchasers.
    ChemLawn also said it began litigation against Waste
Management in federal court in Columbus, seeking injunctive and
other relief.
    The suit alleges, among other things, that certain Waste
Management officers and directors purchased ChemLawn's stock
before making the tender offer. ChemLawn claimed such purchases
possibly violated the officers' fiduciary duties and the
Securities and Exchange Commission's insider trading rules.
    Last week, Waste Management made a tender offer to acquire
ChemLawn for 27 dlrs per share or 270 mln dlrs.
    ChemLawn said its board was determined that Waste's offer
was inadequate and not in the best interest of shareholders,
and could "adversely affect" the interests of its employees,
suppliers, creditors, and customers.
    "Our board carefully reviewed Waste Management offer and
concluded that it does not fully reflect the value of the
company. We strongly urge our shareholders not to tender their
shares to Waste Management," said Chairman L. Jack Van Fossen.
    ChemLawn said its rights plan is designed to protect
shareholders against abusive tactics, such as "market
accumulations by Waste Management or others."
    Under the plan, one comon stock purchase right will be
distributed as a dividend on each outstanding share of ChemLawn
common.
    ChemLawn said its rights holders can buy a share of its
common for one dlr if any entity acquires 25 pct or more of its
commmon, other than by an all cash tender offer for all its
shares or an approved acquisition agreement by its board.
    It said the rights expire July three 1987, or 60 days after
they become exercisable if later than that date. It said its
board may redeem the rights for five cts per right any time
prior to their exercise date.
    ChemLawn said the plan will not be triggered by purchases
purusant to Waste Management's present tender offer.
    It said the dividend will be paid to shareholders of record
March 20.

Sen. Jake Garn (R-Utah) said a delay
in rescuing the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp risked
a run on thrift deposits by nervous customers.
    Garn told a Georgetown University conference on financial
institutions that news reports that the Federal Savings and
Loan Insurance Corp was technically in deficit were true and
urged swift congressional action to strengthen the fund.
    Garn said his office received calls from individuals
worried about the safety of their money. "The runs have started,"
Garn, a member of the Banking Committee, said.
    Legislation to infuse more money into the fund which
insures savings deposits was to be voted on today by the
committee but was postponed because of last-minute differences.
    FSLIC has reserves of two billion dlrs but faces potential
claims of 15 billion dlrs, Garn said.
    He said the claims would not come all at once, however, and
dismissed any real danger to deposits at federally insured
thrifts up to the insurance level of 100,000 dlrs.
    "People's money is safe," Garn said, but he added, "We need to
quiet down the situation and put their fear to bed."
    Garn said he and Committee Chairman William Proxmire
(D-Wis) agree on the need for legislation but they differed
over strategy.
    Garn opposes including other issues in the legislation and
would prefer a bill that was limited to restoring FSLIC and
giving regulators more power to cope with failing banks and
thrifts.
    Proxmire's bill also would prohibit new so-called nonbank
banks and thrifts which use a regulatory loophole to operate
outside the usual legal limits on traditional banks.
    William Isaac, former chairman of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp, told the conference that if that fund were
combined with FSLIC they could have 29 billion dlrs and cover
contingencies for both the bank and thrift industries.
    However, political differences make a merger of the two
federal funds unlikely, Isaac, now president of the Secura
Group, a consulting firm, said.
    By the 1990's the financial industry will include a handful
of nationwide institutions offering every type of financial
service which evolved from today's banks, nontraditional
financial firms and industrial companies.

proposal by English allowing a pilot 0/92 program for 1987
wheat only. That provision was later broadened by the
subcommittee to include 1988 crop winter wheat.
    Under 0/92, a farmer can forego planting a crop but still
collect 92 pct of deficiency payments.
    Earlier today, the House Agriculture committee postponed
until next Tuesday a meeting to consider the disaster aid bill
and 0/92.
    The agreement to limit 0/92 to a wheat pilot program
follows vocal criticism of the proposal by some influential
farm groups who are concerned about the major impact of 0/92,
and by members of Congress wary of reopening the farm bill.
    Congressional sources said there has not been enough time
to study the implications of a broad 0/92.
    "The timing (of the proposal) is off," said one aide to a
House Agriculture committee member.
    However, several Congressional sources said they expect a
broader 0/92 provision to emerge again when the House
Agriculture committee is faced next month with the need to make
spending cuts in the agriculture budget for fiscal 1988 as part
of an overall deficit reduction package.
    Gene Moos, aide to House Majority leader Tom Foley
(D-Wash.), predicted agriculture's share of budget cuts may
exceed one billion dlrs.
    A broader 0/92 might be resurrected later because both the
Congressional Budget Office and the Reagan administration
estimate it would result in significant budget savings.
    A U.S. Agriculture Department official said 0/92 for all
1987 crops would save 300 to 400 mln dlrs and more than 1.5
billion dlrs over five years.
    Another factor which could affect the 0/92 debate is the
approach of planting season, Congressional sources said.
    Some officials said it already is late for implementation
of a 0/92 in 1987 because farm program signup ends March 31 for
wheat and feedgrains.
    If Congress approved 0/92 later in the year sign-up either
would have to be extended or reopened, sources said.

Paradyne Corp said it pleaded guilty
to criminal charges of conspiracy to defraud the Social
Security Administration and agreed to pay 1.2 mln dlrs in fines
and costs to the U.S. Government.
    The company also reached agreements in principle for an 8.1
mln dlr settlement of class action law suits.
    About 2.9 mln dlrs of the class action settlement will be
provided by Paradyne's insurance carrier. The settlement is
contingent on court approval after notice to class members, it
said.
     The criminal case settlement dismisses all charges
including bribery and false statement, except for conspiracy to
which Paradyne pleaded guilty.
    The criminal settlement includes the lifting of the
government's suspension, the dismissal of the federal civil
false claims suit and all charges against the individuals.
    Of the 2.9 mln dlrs the insurance carrier will provide for
the civil settlement, 750,000 dlrs will go to settle a
derivative lawsuit.
    For the year ended December 31, Paradyne reported a net
loss of 38.5 mln dlrs. The year-end results include an 8.0 mln
dlrs provision for future legal and or settlement costs to
cover the civil and criminal settlements announced today.
    Paradyne also said it named Jerry Kendall as president and
chief executive officer, succeeding Robert Wiggins who resigned
as chairman and chief executive officer as part of the
settlement of the indictment.
    Kendall formerly served as executive vice president and
chief operating officer.
    The company also said that due to the sluggish marketplace,
it does not expect to be profitable in the first quarter but is
optimistic about the outlook for the year.
    For the first quarter of 1986, the company reported net
income of 875,000 dlrs on sales of 66.0 mln dlrs.
    Wiggins was among five Paradyine executives who were
charged along with three former officers in a 1985 federal
indictment stemming from a 115 mln contract awarded to Paradyne
in 1981 to build a computer network for the Social Security
Administration.
    The men were accused of conspiring to bribe government
officials and defaud the Social Security Administration.
Wiggins and other defendants were also charged with providing
false testimony and obstructing justice during a Securities and
Exchange Commission investigation.
 
   Under the settlement announced today, federal prosecutors
agreed to defer all charges against Wiggins and three other
defendants under a one-year pretrial agreement.
    The charges would then be dropped if the defendants
successfully complete the probation period. Details of the
requirements in the agreement were not immediately available.

In their search for ways to cut
spending on U.S. farm programs, policymakers and their advisers
here are citing trading in options contracts as an alternative
to federal income and price supports.
    Critics of costly federal farm programs maintain that the
government could get out of guaranteeing minimum support prices
if farmers systematically used options contracts to protect
themselves against vacillating market prices.
    "With agricultural options now available, there is less need
for government price support programs to provide price
stability for farmers," the Heritage Foundation, a conservative
think tank, said in a recent position paper.
    "Washington no longer needs to restrict the level and
variability of commodity market prices. Farmers and others in
agribusiness can now achieve the benefits of price stability by
trading in option markets," the paper, written by Clemson
University professor Kandice Kahl, said.
    Critics of farm programs contend that options offer the
benefits of price support programs without entailing the cost
to taxpayers.
    Kahl's paper urged farmers to buy "put" options in order to
obtain the right to sell at a particular price to the private
seller of the option contract.
    "This gives the farmer a guaranteed price, but still allows
him to profit from higher market prices, if they are available,
by foregoing his option," Kahl said.
    Interest in promoting understanding of options trading
among farmers also has been stirred in Congress by a proposed
change in agricultural policy that would have the effect of
exposing participants in federal farm programs to fluctuations
in income subsidies.
    The proposal -- supported by the Reagan administration and
a cross-section of lawmakers -- would allow farmers to receive
at least 92 pct of their income subsidies regardless of how
much they planted.
    Under current law, farmers enrolled in federal price
stabilization programs receive income subsidies, or deficiency
payments, equal to the difference between a set target price
and the higher of the support price or market price.
    The so-called decoupling plan, or "0/92", would aim to
curtail surplus production by eliminating the requirement that
farmers plant in order to receive deficiency payments.
    Critics of "0/92" plan contend that if the scheme succeeded
in curbing surplus output, market prices would rise and
deficiency payments fall -- leaving farmers who chose not to
plant with shrunken income subsidies and no crops to sell.
    Sen. Rudy Boschwitz (R-Minn.), who has been in the
forefront of efforts to decouple income support from acreage
plantings, advocates replacing the variable deficiency payment
with a fixed and gradually declining payment.
    But many farm state lawmakers are turned off by the idea of
offering fixed subsidies to farmers who plant nothing.
    Some congressional staff members said they are intrigued by
the notion of having the federal government subsidize the
purchase of "call" options to help farmers hedge their income
risk.
    By buying a call option, the farmer would obtain the right
to buy a commodity at a particular price. If the market price
rose above that option price, the farmer could exercise the
option and sell the commodity on the spot market, making up
most of the reduction in the deficiency payment.
    An aide to Boschwitz said the senator might offer
legislation linking options and decoupling, but that it might
have to await the results of a pilot project on futures and
options trading mandated by the 1985 farm bill.
    The bill required USDA, in association with the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission, to conduct a pilot program in at
least 40 counties which produce major program crops.
    The program, only recently launched, was designed to
encourage producers to participate in futures and options
markets and to ensure that producers' net returns would not
fall below the county loan level for the crops in question.

Virazole was a promising drug of major importance and did not

U.S. money supply growth is slowing
down rapidly, and some economists believe that all three of the
Federal Reserve's main monetary aggregates may even have
contracted in February.
    A contraction is unlikely to be a major concern for the
Fed, especially as it would follow a long period of torrid
growth, but it could give the central bank extra leeway in the
weeks ahead if it decided that a relaxation of monetary policy
was justified on account of weakness in the economy.    
    M-1 money supply for the week ended February 23, reported
today, rose 1.9 billion dlrs to 738.5 billion, but preliminary
forecasts call for a drop next week of around two billion dlrs.
The monthly average in January was 737.1 billion dlrs.
    M-1 makes up about a quarter of M-2 and a fifth of M-3.
With other components of M-2, such as money-market deposit
accounts and small time deposits, also falling, the stage is
set for falls in the broader aggregates too, economists say.
    M-1 has been largely discredited because its traditional
link to economic growth has disintegrated under the impact of
falling interest rates and banking deregulation.
    But the consistent behavior of all three aggregates is
likely to impress the Fed, said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch
Economics Inc.
    "The Fed has confidence in the aggregates when they're all
sending the same signal. This is going to raise some eyebrows
at the Fed," McCarthy said.
    Stephen Slifer of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc added, "We
have some very good-looking monetary aggregate data. It's
coming in a lot weaker than I thought."    
    The economists were quick to caution that one month's data
prove nothing, especially because money growth previously had
been so rapid. M-1 in the last 52 weeks has grown at a 16.7 pct
rate and at a 19.1 pct rate in the past 13 weeks.
    Moreover, some of the contraction in M-2 can probably be
explained by a shift of funds from savings vehicles into the
booming stock market and is thus not an indication of a
slowdown in the business expansion.
    But the data raise the tantalizing possibility for the bond
markets that the slowdown in money growth is partly a
reflection of a weaker economy that needs more Fed stimulus.
    McCarthy noted that the slower money growth coincides with
signs that the economy is losing momentum as the quarter
progresses. "Some of the economic indicators are not as rosy as
they were a month ago," he noted.
    He expects only five to six pct M-1 growth in March and
rises in M-2 and M-3 of about four pct.
    Slifer sees stronger growth of 10 pct in M-1 and five pct
or less for M-2 and M-3, but the rates would still be moderate
enough to encourage the Fed to ease policy if gross national
product for the first quarter proved to be weak. "You'd
certainly be more inclined to ease than you would in the past."
    There was certainly nothing in the Fed's latest balance
sheet, however, to suggest a change of policy is already under
way, economists said. Discount window borrowings were in line
with expectations at 233 mln dlrs a day.
    Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International Inc
argued that an easier Fed policy is unlikely to do much to
solve America's most urgent economic problem, its massive trade
deficit. Because of the possibility that further dollar
depreciation - and thus rising inflation - may be needed to
close the trade gap, Brusca said "I'm not prepared to be all
that optimistic about the bond market."

West German gross fishmeal imports rose
60,260 tonnes, or 14.6 pct, last year to 471,891 tonnes, the
highest level since 1972, trade sources said.
    Re-exports fell by 6.6 pct, resulting in a surge in net
imports from 175,901 to 251,708 tonnes, an increase of 43 pct.
    Total West German consumption was estimated at around a
high 287,000 tonnes, largely reflecting attractive prices. The
sources, however, could not give comparative figures for 1985.
    South American producer countries supplied 97 pct of West
German requirements, with Chile shipping 229,176 tonnes (1985 -
182,959) and Peru 210,513 (147,014) tonnes.
    The two South American countries' share of the West German
market rose to 93.2 pct from 80.2 pct because imports from
Ecuador fell to 21,110 tonnes in 1986 from 51,722 in 1985.
    West Germany imported 56,823 tonnes of fishmeal in
December, up from 46,236 tonnes in the same 1985 month, with
re-exports at 22,262 tonnes after 25,062 a year earlier.

    The suit, filed in 1982, charges Porterfield with

alleges that Porterfield used fraudulent invoices and schemes
which netted it more than 3,500,000 dlrs in illegal profits.
    The suit, brought under the Racketeer Influenced and

the court ruled it did not meet certain criteria of the RICO
Act. But an Appeals Court sent the suit back to district court

   The U.K. Ministry of Agriculture is working with the
Department of Health and the Public Health Laboratory to
investigate the whole subject of resistant strains of
salmonella.
    "The Ministry of Agriculture is concerned about the possible
effects on human and animal health," the official said. The
government is also studying a recommendation from the Farm

stake in Dome Mines.
    Concerning Dome Petroleum's 42 pct stake in <Encor Energy

Dome, and we have no intention of selling it."
    Dome spokesman Annesley said in answer to a question that
he was not aware of any negotiations now under way toward the
sale of Dome Petroleum's 20.9 mln Dome Mines shares.
    He also declined to specify at what price the company would
consider selling it shares.
    "Clearly today's prices of more than 15 dlrs a share (of
Dome Mines stock) are very attractive," Annesley commented.
    "We were considering the sale 'at the right price' at a time
when the shares were priced around nine to 10 dlrs," he added. A
price of around 15 dlrs a share would be considered "fairly
attractive," Annesley said.
    Annesley also Dome Petroleum may be able to sell its Dome
Mines' shares at a premium to market prices. "There might be an
opportunity to pick up a premium on that because it would be
virtually a control block in Dome Mines," he said.
    Dome Mines shares traded earlier at 15-1/4 dlrs, off 1/4 on
the Toronto Stock Exchange.
    Dome Petroleum is now negotiating a plan to restructure

American Telephone and Telegraph Co
said it is proposing a new simplified approach to regulating
the long-distance telecommunications market.
    In a filing with the Federal Communications Commission, ATT
proposed replacing the current rate of return regulation with
simplified rules that "would eliminate many costs now imposed on
customers while freeing ATT to introduce new services and
pricing options more swiftly."
    The filing comes one day after MCI Communications Corp said
the firm will seek immediate deregulation of its principal
long-distance competitor, ATT.
    Under the approach outlined in the filing, ATT would commit
to continue providing basic long-distance services to all
customers and to maintain uniform nationwide prices in all
parts of the country unless granted regulatory approval to do
otherwise.
    Specifically, ATT proposed that the FCC require the company
to file tariffs for new interstate services and price changes
that would go into effect within 14 days.
    In addition, the proposal calls for the reduction of the
voluminous documentation ATT is required to file each time it
introduces or changes long-distance services.
    The new proposal would place the burden on challengers to
demonstrate that ATT's tariffs "are unreasonable".
    It would also require long-distance companies to submit
periodic reports to help regulators monitor competition in the
industry.
    Lawrence Garfinkel, ATT's Vice-President of Marketing
Services, said, "With this filing, we're suggesting that
regulators replace a blanket approach to regulating ATT with a
more finely tuned, targeted approach."

    Economists stressed that gains in hours worked signal much
larger gains in February U.S. production and income than
previously forecast.
    The average work week rose 0.2 hours to 35.0 hours from
34.8 hours in January. The average manufacturing work week rose
0.3 hours to 41.2 hours, the longest factory work week since
November 1966, the Commerce Department said.
    "The gains in manufacturing employment point to a very
large increase in industrial production of between 0.5 and 0.7
pct," said Joe Carson of Chemical Bank. This compares to a 0.4
pct  gain in January U.S. industrial production.
    Peter Greenbaum of Smith Barney Harris Upham and Co Inc
noted that the average wage rate increased to 8.87 dlrs an hour
in February from 8.83 dlrs in January.
    "Combined with the increase in hours worked, this means
we'll get a pretty healthy gain in personal income vis-a-vis
the wage and salary disbursement," he said.
    Greenbaum said that February U.S. personal income should
rise at least 0.5 pct after being flat in January.
    He said the February employment gains are consistent with
his firm's first quarter U.S. real gross national product
growth forecast of 3.7 pct.
    Economists agreed that the employment data were negative
for the credit markets in that they signal a healthier economy
and no easing in the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. But
most said that the market need not fear tighter policy either.
    "This report is another reason for the Fed to not consider
easing," said Ray Stone of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc.  
  "It gives them more room to address the dollar situation," he
said. "If they had to nudge policy tighter, they could do so,
but it's most likely they'll sit and wait."
    "The data have not been uniform," Stone added. "Durable
goods were weak in January and now employment is strong."
    In January, U.S. durable goods orders dropped 7.5 pct,
followed by a 4.0 pct drop in U.S. factory goods orders. U.S.
retail sales fell 5.8 pct, and the U.S. merchandise trade gap
widened to 14.8 billion dlrs.
    "Things just aren't adding up," said Steve Slifer of Lehman
Goverment Securities Inc. "Consumer spending, capital spending,
goverment spending, and net exports data show very weak first
quarter GNP growth of one pct," he said.
    "The employment and production data point to a big
inventory build-up, but that's what we thought in the fourth
quarter and we only got 1.3 pct GNP growth."
    Manufacturing employment gained 50,000 after falling 15,000
in January. Economists estimated that 30,000 of the gain was
accounted for by striking workers in the steel and machinery
industries returning to work.
    Even so, some economists said that the manufacturing gains
have resulted from an improving trade outlook.
    Jason Benderly of Goldman, Sachs and Co noted that the U.S.
trade picture improved in the fourth quarter as net exports
grew at a 20 pct annual rate while the rate of increase in
imports fell to only six pct, and that it continues to improve
in the first quarter.
    "Not only the official statistics for the fourth quarter,
but evidence of a pick up in orders from overseas for paper
products, chemicals, high-tech goods, and capital goods show
that trade is improving," Benderley said.
    "The economy is moving between extremes," he said. "Some
reports are going to look bad and some good, but first quarter
GNP is going to grow in the middle at about three pct."
    A 287,000 gain in services employment comprised the greater
part of February's employment gain. Retail services employment
rose 129,000 in February, compared to a gain of 117,000 in
January, previously reported at 166,000.
    Construction employment rose a slim 2,000 in February. But
this follows a robust 113,000 gain in January, revised down
from a previously reported 142,000 gain.
    The U.S. civilian unemployment rate was unchanged in
February at 6.7 pct. This means the jobless rate has stayed at
6.7 pct for three consecutive months, the lowest reading since
March 1980, the Commerce Department noted.
    "The Federal Reserve has to be pleased with this report,"
Carson said. "This takes away the Fed's flexibility to ease,
but there's no reason to tighten. It's way too early for that."

the agreement among industrial nations in Paris last month is
only a start in Washington's drive to intensify economic
cooperation among leading countries.

culminating in the Paris Accord, are only a start."
    He added "we see our role as a steward of a process in which
we sit down with our industrial allies to find ways to promote
more balanced international growth."
    The Paris agreements called trade surplus countries to
strengthen their growth and on the U.S. to reduce its budget
deficit. Under such circumstances, the countries agreed their
currencies were within ranges broadly consistent with economic
fundamentals.
    Baker also said he still sees "ominous" signs of pressure for
protectionist trade legislation "and this pressure for
protectionism is coming from new areas of society."
    But he also said he believed a coalition was forming that

<Toronto Dominion Bank> said it agreed
to acquire a seat on the Toronto Stock Exchange, becoming the
first Canadian bank to do so after government proposals to
allow banks full involvement in the securities industry.
    The bank, Canada's fifth largest, said one of its
subsidiaries was already a member of the Toronto Futures
Exchange and that this further step showed the bank's
commitment to active involvement in the securities industry.
    Toronto Dominion established a discount brokerage service
in 1984 called Green Line Investors Service that now serves
more investors than any other discount broker in Canada.
    The bank previously said in January that it preferred to
establish its own securities unit rather than acquire an
existing investment dealer.
    "Full TSE access will enable us to provide an even higher
level of customer service and maintain Green Line's position as
an industry leader," said Toronto Dominion president Robert
Korthals in a statement.
    He told reporters at a news conference that the bank agreed
to purchase the seat for 195,000 dlrs from Hector M. Chisholm
and Co.
    The price represents a recent high from the 166,000 dlrs
paid for a seat in 1981, but the record price remains 200,000
dlrs paid in 1929.

Purchases of West German bonds in
January reached a record 13 billion marks' worth as a result of
investment from other European countries amid expectations of a

    This produced a surplus in the securities item of the
long-term capital account of 11.17 billion marks and was the
primary contributor to a 10.15 billion surplus in the total
capital account, turning round December's 6.48 billion deficit.
    In January last year, the capital account, combining long
and short-term flows, showed a surplus of 2.27 billion marks,
the Bundesbank said.
    The Bundesbank said foreign purchase of German shares in
January was, by contrast to the massive bond investments, only
about 200 mln marks worth, while overseas purchases of
"Schuldschein" promissory notes fell by 500 mln from December.
    The long-term account in total showed a surplus of 11.17
billion marks, reversing the 2.60 billion deficit in December
and up from a surplus of 9.37 billion in January, 1986.
    Among other items, direct domestic investment abroad posted
an outflow of 2.86 billion marks after a deficit of 4.98
billion in December and a surplus of 1.13 billion in January
last year.
    The Bundesbank confirmed earlier figures from the federal
statistics office that the current account surplus in January
fell to 4.86 billion marks from 8.47 billion last year.
    The trade surplus in the month was down to 7.20 billion
from 11.57 billion in December.
    In the invisibles account, the surplus on services was 100

Standard and Poor's Corp said debt
ratings on 840 mln dlrs of debt of Baker International Corp and
Hughes Tool Co remain on creditwatch.
    S and P cited the adjournment of a special shareholder
meeting in which Hughes objected to certain conditions for the
merger of the companies set by the U.S. Justice Department.
    If the merger is consumated, S and P would rate the newly
formed Baker Hughes Inc senior debt at A-minus, subordinated
debt at BBB-plus and commercial paper at A-2. But if the merger
does not occur, Baker's senior debt would be cut to A-minus
from A and commercial paper to A-2 from A-1.
    Without the merger, Hughes Tool's current ratings of B-plus
for senior debt, B-minus for subordinated debt and C for
commercial paper would be affirmed, S and P said.

Genentech Inc said it filed
a suit against the Food and Drug Administration in the U.S.
District Court for the District of Columbia over an unresolved
issue relating to genetically engineered human growth hormone.
    At issue, said Genentech, is whether Eli Lilly and Co's
<ELI> recombinant human growth hormone and its new recombinant
growth hormone, are the same drug. Both drugs are under review
by the FDA.
    Since 1985, Genentech has been marketing Protropin, a
recombinant human growth hormone for treating abnormally short
children.
    The biotechnology concern said it has the right to seven
years of exclusive marketing for Protropin, granted orphan drug
status by the FDA. Orphan drugs are a special category of drugs
that are used to treat rare diseases.
    Genentech said the suit seeks clarification of what
constitutes a drug under the standards of the orphan Drug Act.
It suggested that without the "clarification," companies that
develop orphan drugs may not recover development costs during
the period of marketing exclusivity.
    It said Lilly's growth hormone and its new growth hormone
differ slightly, and are produced by different processes.

The French primary bond market is showing
signs of renewed effervescence after several weeks of lethargy
and the trend is expected to continue if hopes of imminent
interest rate cuts are fulfilled, market operators said.
    The Bank of France is generally expected to give a signal
to the market, possibly at the beginning of next week, by
announcing a quarter point cut in its intervention rate, which
has stood at eight pct since January 2, or in its seven-day
repurchase rate, set at 8-3/4 pct since January 5.
    The central bank's averaged-out day to day call money rate,
the reference rate for interbank money market operators, which
reached 8-3/4 pct on February 18 has fallen to 7-3/4 pct this
week, dealers noted.
    The Bank of France's "open market" policy to regulate the
money markets since December has been based on a floor and
ceiling of rates within the limits of its intervention and
seven day repurchase rates.
    For the moment the sentiment is of "wait and see" on rate
cuts, but there are now more optimists than pessimists among
market operators, a dealer for a major French bank said.
    Dealers said there is abundant liquidity on the bond
market, noting that this week's monthly Treasury tap issue of
11.87 billion francs had a good reception and was fairly easily
absorbed.
    The Treasury had set an upper limit on the issue of 12
billion francs and was likely to continue to try and sell as
much paper as it could over coming months to meet its borrowing
needs for this year of around 150 billion, one banker said.
    Dealers said there was no difficulty in placing liquidity
in the primary market at the moment despite competition from
the surge in investments on the Paris stock exchange.
    There has been a flood of large bond issues, but with
formulas well adapted to market conditions and investor demand
- with warrants or a mix of fixed and floating-rates - which
have been snapped up, and with generally broadly negative fees.
    Dealers pointed to the recent Caisse d'Aide a l'Equipement
des Collectivites Locales (CAECL) 8.90 pct two billion franc
bond with warrants exchangeable for floating-rate bonds issued
over 13 years and 80 days at 97.04 pct with payment date March
9, which was today quoted at -0.90 to -1.10 pct.
    Even classic fixed-rate issues, after being neglected since
the end of last year, are finding buyers, one banker said.
    Dealers said that now the question was to see how the terms
of imminent operations would be set, with great market interest
focussed on the likely three next issues.
    These will include an expected four to five billion franc
issue for Electricite de France, to be followed by a bond of
around one billion francs for Auxiliaire du Credit Foncier, a
subsidiary of the banking group Credit Foncier de France, and a
new issue by tender from the mortgage agency Caisse de
Refinancement Hypothecaire.

NEC Electronics Inc, a
unit of NEC Corp <NIPNY> said a U.S. District Court judge
denied NEC's motion to disqualify Judge William Ingram from
presiding over its lawsuit against Intel Corp <INTC>.
    NEC said it sought to disqualify the judge when it learned
in October 1986 that Ingram had an ownership interest in an
investment club that owned Intel stock.
    Ingram reported that his interest in Intel through the club
amounted to about 80 dlrs worth of Intel's stock and the judge
ended his participation in the investment club after NEC moved
to have him disqualified, an NEC spokeswoman said.
    NEC said it intends to appeal the ruling.
    NEC sued Intel in December 1984 seeking a judgement
declaring that microcode, or the control function, in certain
NEC microprocessor products does not infringe on any valid
Intel copyrights.
    Intel subsequently filed a suit charging NEC with
infringing on Intel semiconductor copyrights.

This week's Bank of England resistance to
strong market pressure for lower interest rates succeeded in
holding bank base rates at 11 pct.
    But at a cost of threatening the Chancellor of the
Exchequer Nigel Lawson's policy, stated at the end of the Paris
Group of Six meeting last month, that he wanted to see sterling
broadly stable about then prevailing levels, market sources
said.
    Since then, the pound has risen to 71.8 pct on its closing
trade-weighted index, up from 69.7 pct imediately after the
Paris meeting and up 0.4 on the day.
    Today's peak at 72.0 pct was its highest since August 19.
    A Treasury spokesman said Lawson had said he neither wanted
a substantial rise or fall in sterling. The question is
therefore how large a rise he is ready to see before acting.
    Paul Temperton, chief economist at Merrill Lynch Europe
Ltd, estimated that the government wanted to see the
trade-weighted index about 72-73 pct. "Even after this action
over the last few weeks, sterling's only just within striking
distance of that range," he said.
    Other analysts agree that the government probably has some
broad target range around this area.
    However, they said Lawson would be prepared to see the
pound go higher at least in the short term, despite the risk of
a loss of export competitiveness and cheaper prices on imports.
    "If the Bank of England keeps the interest rates as they
are, what's to stop it (going higher)," said John Cox, executive
director of EBC Amro Bank Ltd, a major operator on the London
foreign exchange market.
    Cox estimates that the Bank of England has been active
selling sterling over the past few days, despite the lack of
general market talk of such intervention, and this has helped
keep it below 1.60 dlrs.
    The pound rose to 1.5870 dlrs from 1.5764 yesterday and
1.5400 February 23, the day after the Paris meeting.
    But Cox says the government must be worried with sterling
heading toward 2.95 marks and would be very concerned if it
holds around these levels.
    He warned the Bank may run the risk of missing the interest
rate boat. "If rates don't come down, the market will say they
ought to have come down and will sell sterling," he said.
    Most dealers agree there is a good deal of "hot money" being
invested in sterling, money simply attracted by high overnight
or one-week rates, which could flow out at equally short
notice.
    However, the authorities will hope that at least a
proportion of the buying reflects long-term investment.
    "The last thing they want to do is reduce them (rates) and
have to jack them back up again," said Richard Jeffrey,
economist at brokerage house Hoare Govett Ltd.
    He said a half point cut would ensure continued support for
sterling, at least in the near term.
    However, most analysts are still looking for a full point
about March 17, Budget Day.
    The Bank must hold out until it sees the reaction to the
Budget, said Temperton.
    The Budget is widely forecast to be a vote winner in the
run-up to a general election, the major factor behind current
bullishness in the government bond and currency markets.
    "Lawson wants to delay a cut in base rates until the budget.
He wants it to be crowned with the glory of an interest rate
cut," said Ian Harwood, economist at Warburg Securities, the
equities arm of Mercury International Group.
    Speculation a clearing bank might break ranks and lead the
way lower were confounded today. There was excitement a fall in
the weekly Treasury Bill rate to 9.7 pct from 10.2 pct last
Friday might mean the Bank had changed its mind.
    This followed the imposition of penal lending rates of 11
3/4 pct on the discount houses yesterday, and was the lowest
since base rates were at 10 pct, early last October.
    However, with this Bill rate pertaining to three-months
money, banking sources said the market could not take the cut
as a guide to the Bank's intentions on short term rates.

The world trade body GATT said its
negotiators in Geneva are discussing a possible agreement for a
ceiling on agricultural subsidies.
    GATT director-general for agriculture Jean-Marc Lucq told
reporters here that the talks had not got anywhere yet as the
participants were still reluctant to lay all their cards on the
table.
    He said the ceilings under discussion would only be applied
to those members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
with high subsidy spending.
    Lucq said a survey by the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development showed that its 24 member western
industrialised countries subsidised their agriculture by a
total average of more than 100 billion dlrs a year from
1979-81.
    Within that total, the U.S. Spent 26 billion dlrs, Japan 24
billion, and the European Community 57 billion dlrs.
    Yves Berthelot, an official for the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development, said the suppression of
agricultural subsidies in temperate countries, which would
allow a resurgence of world prices and a lowering of domestic
prices, would be difficult but inevitable.

Outboard Marine Corp's top executives
are making sales presentations to portfolio managers and
analysts ahead of a planned two mln share offering expected
soon, company officials said.
    Chairman Charles Strang and Wayne Jones, vice president for
strategic planning, are meeting with portfolio managers in New
York and Boston to line up interest for the offering
underwritten solely by Morgan Stanley, the officials said.
    Outboard Marine has been the subject of recurring takeover
rumors, with one rumor this week naming Sun Chemical as the
potential suitor for 40 dlrs a share.
    Sun Chemical is said to have 4.9 pct of Outboard and is
conducting a study on whether to bid for control of the marine
engine and boatbuilding company. A Sun Chemical spokesman
declined to comment.
    Stanley Fishman, analyst at Fahnestock and Co, said it is
better for a suitor to bid for Outboard before the two mln
shares are sold. Outboard now has 17 mln shares outstanding.
    "Even though Outboard would use proceeds from the share
offering to pay down debt, and there would be less debt the
acquiring company would assume, it still means more shares the
suitor must buy to acquire the company," he said.
    Fishman, who has heard the Sun Chemical rumor, said a 40
dlrs a share would just open the bidding.
    Outboard Marine today was trading at 33-5/8, down 5/8.
    "There are only two companies that count in the marine
leisure business, Brunswick Corp <BC> being the first. But you
can't play down number two," He said. "It's a growing field.
There's a lot of leisure money out there. I think 40 would be a
minimum price. It will be higher."
    A Morgan Stanley spokesman said the offering has been
approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission but a
kick-off date and price have not been set.

of the main steam isolation valve's acceptablility will be

projection was scheduled for review upon completion of the main
steam isolation valve testing program which company officials
still expect next week.

    The money, which will be used to alleviate unemployment

spending on special areas of concern.
    Apart from unemployment, these include relief to farmers

Standard and Poor's Corp said it
expects downgrades of corporate debt ratings to ease this year
from the lofty levels of 1986 and 1985.
    However, the rating agency said upgrades will probably stay
at about the same level as in the past few years.
    The narrowing of the gap between downgrades and upgrades
would reflect a calming in takeover frenzy, less volatile
energy markets and slow but steady economic growth, S and P
said.
    In particular, S and P expects that the industrial and
banking sectors would have a less turbulent year than in 1986.
    S and P noted that 60 pct of 1986's downgrades were
concentrated in the industrial sector, where the most negative
factor was takeover fever that led to debt-financed mergers and
acquisitions and costly defenses to fend off takeovers.
    It said takeovers appear to be on the decline this year.
    While S and P noted that the energy markets have stabilized
after last year's collapse, it stressed that 1987 would not
mark a turnaround for this industry.
    In addition, S and P does not expect any big shocks to hit
the junk bond market this year, especially of the magnitude of
1986's unexpected LTV Corp <LTV> bankruptcy filing.
    Utilities, which were a positive influence in the overall
1986 trend, should be a pocket of strength again this year. But
like last year, gas utilities could buck this trend, S and P
said.
    The rating agency said that downgrades would continue to
outpace upgrades among financial institutions. But 1987's
rating changes will not be as skewed as 1986's 2.1 to one ratio
of downgrades to upgrades, S and P predicted.
    S and P said debt ratings for the transportation industry
would remain stable, aside from changes because of mergers. A
detailed report will appear in the March 9 S/P Creditweek.

Commission filing that it holds a 5.35 pct interest in Chicago
Milwaukee.
    Chicago Milwaukee's stock edged up 2-1/8 to 138 on turnover
of 8,100 shares, as one of the biggest gainers on the NYSE. The
stock has been trading in a 154 to 128 range for the last 52
weeks.
    Edwin Jacobson, Chicago Milwaukee president, declined to
comment on movement of the company's stock but said,"From an
investment point of view, we are pleased to have Shearson,
Lehman as a substantial investor."
    Shearson, Lehman purchased the shares for investment
purposes and may continue buying shares depending on market
conditions, according to the filing.
    Chicago Milwaukee, which sold its railroad interests to Soo
Line Railroad Co (SOO) in February 1985, currently manages and

U.S. crude oil prices rose above 18 
dlrs a barrel this week and industry analysts said the price
could rise another dollar as inventories fall.
    "OPEC is keeping its production down, and in the cash market
there is tight supply of crude with short transportation time
to major refining centers," said Daniel McKinley, oil analyst
with Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co. "That could send prices
50 cts to a dollar higher," he added.
    The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate rose to
18.15 dlrs a barrel today, a rise of 1.50 dlrs this week.
    The rally in oil prices this week came after prices fell in
February more than two dlrs from its high of 18.25 dlrs a
barrel.
    "Oil traders were pulling prices down on the assumption that
oil stocks were building and OPEC was producing well above its
15.8 mln bpd quota, but now both of those assumptions have come
under question," McKinley said.
    Yesterday the International Energy Agency in its monthly
report said that oil stocks in the OECD area, or in
industrialized nations, were drawn down by 1.3 mln bpd during
the first quarter of this year.
    IEA estimates that the draw in oil stocks during the first
quarter of this year will come largely from oil companies whose
inventory levels by April one will be an estimated 326 mln
tonnes, or about 74 days consumption.
    Industry analysts also said the estimate of a 3.5 mln bpd
draw in stocks made by Shell Chairman Peter Holmes yesterday
fed speculation that other major companies were destocking.
    Traders said the destocking has come about as a result of a
so-called buyers strike, which kept refiners from buying
officially priced OPEC oil in an effort to get the organization
to offer discounts to the official price.
    "This struggle between the companies and OPEC is the
ultimate game of chicken but it will be resolved relatively
soon. I would imagine by about the middle of the month (March),"
the general trading manager of an international oil company
told

The attempt by International Paper Co
<IP> and Stone Container Co <STO> to raise linerboard prices
could stick, industry analysts said, citing strong demand and
tight capacity. But they said rising inventories hurt the odds.
    "It remains to be seen whether the increases will be
accepted, but I think the odds are better than 50-50 they
will," Mark Rogers, paper analyst for Prudential Bache said.
    Mead Corp <ME> and Union Camp Corp <UCC> said they are also
considering price increases.
    Rogers, who has been aggressively recommending Stone and
International Paper for several months, said the increases
could stick because plants are running full tilt and little new
capacity is coming on stream.
    "The operating rates in linerboard are running at about 97
to 98 pct of capacity, but demand continues to climb," Gene
Cartledge, chairman and chief executive officer of Union Camp
said "The industry is essentially sold out."
    Cartledge said domestic linerboard shipments in January hit
about 1.6 mln tons, six pct higher than January 1986, while
exports hit 170,000 tons, three to four pct higher.
    Nevertheless, rising inventories could nip the increase in
the bud, Lawrence Ross, forest products analyst for Paine
Webber, said.
    "Containerboard inventories have been growing for the past
three months," Ross said. "Over that time inventories rose from
4.8 weeks worth of supplies to 5.9 weeks most recently."
    Also, Ross said that the Jacksonville, Fla., paper mill, 49
pct owned by Stone, is planning to come on stream again soon,
which may help alleviate some of the supply constraints. "The
plant's capacity, by itself, is about two pct of the industry
total," Ross said.
    But, Rogers said the Jacksonville mill "won't be enough" to
significantly ease tight capacity this year. The price increase
is necessary, he said, to attract more investment.
    Rates of return in the industry have been too low in recent
years to merit inventment in new capocity, Rogers said, adding
that he sees prices climbing to the 400 dlrs-a-ton range this
year.
    "The consensus on the Street is changing," he said, "from
whether there will be increases to when is the next increase
and how much."

The Minneapolis Grain Exchange (MGE)
will start trading futures contracts in high fructose corn
syrup on April 6 if the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
(CFTC) approves the contract as expected next week.
    Pat Henderson, spokesperson for the MGE, said the exchange
expects contract approval at CFTC's Tuesday meeting. It has
been under review since the exchange submitted the proposal in
December, 1985.
    The proposed contract is based on 48,000 pound lots of
55-pct high fructose corn syrup, the equivalent of one tank
truck of the sweetening agent derived from corn in the wet
milling process. The syrup, commonly called HFCS-55, is most
commonly used as a sweetener in soft drinks and other
beverages.
    Delivery would be by shipping certificate from production
facilities designated by the exchange. The contract, designated
by the symbol "HF," would trade from 0900 to 1315 CST. Months
traded would correspond with the Chicago corn futures months of
March, May, July, September and December.
    Contract price will be quoted per hundred weight, with a
minimum price fluctuation of one cent and maximum fluctuation
of one dlr per CWT.
    "We hope the producers and users of fructose will be
actively involved, those producers being the large processors,
the corn wet millers, and the users being the beverage
bottlers," Henderson said. "But there are potentials for all
types of people to use it. There is quite a list of industries
that utilize fructose."

Telecom Plus International Inc
said <Siemens AG>'s Siemens Information Systems wants to amend
its agreement to purchase Telecom's 65 pct interest in Tel Plus
Communications to delay payment of 25 mln dlrs for 11 months.
    Telecom's shareholders are scheduled to vote on the 165 mln
dlr transaction Monday.
    Telecom said it advised Siemens it intends to close the
transaction on March 16, as scheduled, if it is approved by
shareholders. A spokesman said this means Telecom will decide
before the 16th whether or not to accept the proposed change.
    Explaining its request for the amendment, Siemens informed
Telecom it had recently become aware of information causing
concern with respect to certain accounting and other matters.
    Siemens said it will therefore need to continue its review
beyond March 16 to determine whether certain representations
and warranties are true.
    Telecom said it advised Siemens it knows of no information
which would make its representations and warranties untrue.
    Siemens already owns the remaining 35 pct of Tel Plus. The
65 pct represenmts Telecom's principal operating asset.
    A Telecom spokesman said the agreement calls for payment of
all but 29 mln dlrs of the price at closing. Of this, 21 mln
dlrs was to be paid 11 months later and two mln dlrs per year
on the anniversary date of the transaction.
    He said Siemens is now proposing that 25 mln dlrs be added
to the 21 mln dlrs to be paid in 11 months.
    Telecom said the proposed amendment would also permit
Siemens to defer repayment of up to an additional 50 pct of
certain intercompany debt until completion of the review.
Telecom said it estimates this to ba about 15 mln dlrs.

Lucky Stores Inc said it and
investor Asher Edelman agreed on a settlement that prohibits
Edelman and his group from taking specified actions to obtain
control of the company and that limits the Edelman group's
ownership of Lucky's stock to less than five pct of any voting
securities.
    The arrangement also provides for the dismissal of pending
litigation between the parties, Lucky Stores said.
    The settlement also calls for the withdrawal of Edelman's
motion to intervene in pending shareholder actions against
Lucky Stores and its directors, the company said.
    In addition, the standstill provisions also apply to
Hancock Fabrics after it is spun off to Lucky stockholders, the
company said.
    Lucky Stores said the arrangement also calls for the
company to submit to stockholders at a special meeting set for
December 31 a proposal from Edelman seeking their views
concerning repeal of a charter provision that limits the voting
power of substantial Lucky stockholders.
    Edelman, who owns about five pct of Lucky Stores' stock,
last year was rebuffed in his effort to acquire the company.
    Last October Lucky Stores implimented a restructuring
program that included the repurchase of 28 pct of its own
common shares and reincorporation in Delaware.
    The spinoff of Hancock Textile Co, a chain of 324 retail
stores, was one of the key parts of the restructuring program.
    Edelman and his Plaza Securities Co partnership
subsequently sued in an attempt to block the proposed
reincorporation, which was a condition of the repurchase and
restructuring plan.
    Under this latest arrangement, Lucky Stores said it agreed
to reimburse the Edelman group for 2.8 mln dlrs of
out-of-pocket expenses, which include litigation and other
costs.
    "This agreement serves the interests of Lucky stockholders
by avoiding the significant cost of continued litigation and
the accompanying demands on management time," Lucky Stores
chairman John Lillie said in a statement.

American Telephone and Telegraph Co's
proposal to deregulate its long distance phone service is
unlikely to produce a radical change in phone rates, but it
should help the company's profits, analysts said.
    "Deregulation will mean more pricing discounts for large
volume users, but status quo for residential users," said
PaineWebber Group analyst Jack Grubman.
    But the proposals will scrap the pricing formula that has
constrained the company's profits in the long distance
business, leading to higher profit margins, analysts said.
    ATT has long pushed for deregulation of its long-distance
business, the profits of which have been limited by a regulated
rate-of-return on the company's investments. The rate was cut
last year to 12.20 from 12.75 pct.
    Earlier today the company proposed to the Federal
Communications Commission to scrap the formula, cut the amount
of time needed to approve rate proposals, and leave it up to
its competitors to oppose it filings.
    MCI Communications Corp <MCIC> made a similar filing
yesterday, saying greater the moves would increase competition
in the telephone business.
    Analysts said the proposals will allow ATT to cut costs in
the long-distance unit, and increase its profit margins
previously constrained by the rate of return. But many said
they did not expect the proposals to lead to higher prices in
the industry, simply because of the competition the phone
industry giant faces.
    "You probably wouldn't see as much of a price decline,"
said Gartner Group analyst Fritz Ringling. "But you wouldn't
see a rise." Grubman said the proposals will allow ATT to
selectively raise or lower prices, depending on the market. "It
will give ATT a lot more flexibility," he said.
    ATT now faces a period of comment in which a number of
companies will be able to respond to the proposals in FCC
hearings.
    It may face at least one strong opponent, U.S. Sprint, the
long distance joint venture between GTE Corp <GTE> and United
Telecommunications Inc <UT>.
    "We think the Congress of the FCC should establish a
reasonable rate of return. Someone should establish it," a U.S.
Sprint spokesman said. But he added the company was not opposed
to greater competition.
    It may also take some time for the proposals to go through,
and in the process they may be altered by the various
constituencies affected by the move.
    "There's so much complexity, so much inertia, so much
bureacracy, that stricly speaking about the mechanisms, it
won't happen that fast," said analyst Victor Krueger of the
Gartner Group.

An investor group led by New York
investor George Soros said it was dissatisfied with Fairchild

holdings to as much as 49.9 pct of the aerospace and aviation
company's outstanding stock.
    The group already controls 1,647,481 Fairchild Industries
shares or 11.5 pct of the total outstanding.
    The group said it filed on Wednesday with federal antitrust
regulators for advance clearance to buy enough additional
shares to increase its total stake to up to 49.9 pct of the
total outstanding stock.
    The group said its representatives had met with Fairchild
Industries officials to inform them "that they do not believe
management has been successful in enhancing or protecting
shareholder values."
    It said it was considering the additional share purchases
to enable it to "assert a greater degree of influence over the
future management and policies of the issuer."
    It said a decision on the specific level of share ownership
it would seek depended on market prices, future changes in
management policies, available financial resources and other
factors.

measures intended to influence Fairchild management and
policies, either alone or in concert with other investors.

Federal Reserve Board Governor Robert
Heller said the U.S. legal and regulatory framework of the U.S
financial system needs a complete overhaul so American banks
can be more competitive in international markets.
    "It has become abundantly clear that our financial system
must be overhauled to bring it up to the standard that will be
required if we are to remain the leading financial power of the
world in the coming years," Heller said in a speech prepared for
delivery to a financial services industry conference.
    Heller said a patchwork approach to changing the nation's
banking and financial services laws will not work.
    "Instead, a comprehensive overhaul of the entire financial
system is called for," he said.
    Heller said he was encouraged that Congress would take a
comprehensive look at reforming the nation's banking laws after
they enact legislation now pending that would recapitalize the
Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp and give federal
regulators more power to deal with failing banks.
    Heller said he liked the concept of the financial services
holding company, which would allow a bank to exist side by side
with other financial services companies. He said that would end
the debate on securities powers for banks.
    "The holding company may own both a securities house and a
bank, so that both services may be provided to the same
customer, subject to safeguards against conflicts of interest,"
he said.
    Such an institution be in a better position to compete in
the financial services markets around the globe, he said.
    Heller said he expects world trade to expand more rapidly
that domestic production and that traditional trade finance
should grow with it.
    "It may be time to dust off the old letters of credit and to
prepare for an increase in traditional export financing
opportunities," Heller said.
    But he warned that protectionist sentiments could "kill the
golden goose that is about to provide new profit opportunities
for international traders and bankers alike that will benefit
consumers by providing them with cheaper goods."

Dome Petroleum Ltd is under pressure
from one of its largest creditors, <Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce>, to sell its 42 pct stake in <Encor Energy Corp Ltd>,
energy industry analysts said.
    Dome has pledged its 42.5 mln Encor shares as security for
part of its debt to Commerce Bank, estimated last year at 947
mln Canadian dlrs, and the bank wants Dome to sell the stock to
pay down debt, analysts said.
    "The Commerce has been slowly but surely moving Encor in the
direction that might make it a saleable asset," said one analyst
who asked not to be named.
    Dome earlier said it was not considering selling Encor
Energy, but reaffirmed the company's 23.3 pct interest in
Canadian gold producer Dome Mines Ltd <DM> is up for sale "at
the right price."
    Dome, now negotiating a plan to restructure more than 6.10
billion dlrs in debt, sees Encor as a strategic investment that
it does not intend to sell, spokesman David Annesley said. The
Encor shares do not pay dividends.
    A Commerce Bank spokesman also declined comment when asked
whether it is pressing Dome to sell its Encor stake.
    At current market prices, Dome's stake in Encor would be
valued at about 308 mln dlrs, while its 20.9 mln Dome Mines
shares would be worth about 319 mln dlrs.
    Recent strength in the price of Encor shares may also
prompt Commerce Bank to press Dome to divest its holding in the
Canadian oil and gas producer, analysts said.
    "Encor's stock price has improved quite substantially in
recent weeks with a runup in crude prices," Peters and Co Ltd
oil analyst Wilf Gobert commented.
    "The possibility is that Commerce Bank would like to see it
sold at these levels because they can get more for it now than
they have been able to in recent years," he added.
    Encor traded earlier on the Toronto Stock Exchange at
7-1/8, near its 52-week high of 7-1/2 and up from around six
dlrs in early February.
    The company also recently set up its own operating
management, which was previously carried out by Dome Petroleum,
Maison Placements Canada Inc analyst Denis Mote commented.
    Dome and Encor "are actually going to get farther apart. So
(the sale) does make a lot of sense," Mote said.
    However, analysts said Dome will resist any moves to divest
Encor in favor of retaining the operating assets since sale
proceeds would likely go directly to pay down Dome's debt to
Commerce Bank.
    "I think they'll probably try to hang onto Encor as long as
they can," said Bache Securities Inc analyst Doug Weber.
    Some of Dome's group of 56 major creditors might move to
block such a sale, arguing they have a claim on company assets.
    "Other creditors generally all want to make sure that
something they might be able to get a piece of is not being
sold out from under them," said analyst Gobert.
    Another stumbling block would be Encor's 225 mln dlr joint
liability in loans to Dome Petroleum advanced by Arctic
Petroleum Corp of Japan for Beaufort Sea exploration.
    Analysts said a similar hurdle could also hinder the
possible sale of Dome Petroleum's interest in Dome Mines.
    Dome Mines has guaranteed 225 mln dlrs of Dome Petroleum's
debt and has a "right of consent" to the sale of Dome Petroleum's
holding.
    Presumably, a potential buyer of the Dome Mines shares
would seek some type of relief on the company's debt
obligations connected with Dome Petroleum, Gobert said.
    Dome spokesman Annesley earlier declined to specify at what
price the company would consider selling its Dome Mines shares,
but said current prices of more than 15 dlrs a share "are very
attractive."

Advocates of a 0/92 plan for
feedgrains will likely delay offering their proposals if a
disaster aid bill before the House Agriculture Committee is
scaled back to include only 1987 winter wheat, congressional
sources said.
    The disaster aid bill, introduced by Rep. Glenn English
(D-Okla.), sparked sharp controversy with its proposals to
implement a 0/92 program for 1987 wheat and 1988 winter wheat.
    An agreement has been reached to trim the bill back to 1987
wheat, but supporters of a 0/92 feedgrains plan said even that
scaled-down version would not be equitable for farmers.
    Unless the English bill pertains only to 1987 winter wheat,
it is more than a simple disaster payment and feedgrains should
be treated equally, they said.
   If the bill is narrowed to just winter wheat, then
supporters of a 0/92 feedgrains amendment will probably not
offer their proposals next week, sources said.
   English has agreed to support an amendment by Rep. Charles
Stenholm (R-Tex) to narrow the bill to 1987 wheat only, but
whether he would also back a further reduction is unclear.
    Agricultural aides to English said the congressman's first
choice is to make the option available to all 1987 wheat
farmers. However, if the political reality is that disaster aid
for winter wheat farmers would be unavailable because of
controversy over spring wheat, then English might consider an
even greater cutback in the bill, they said.
    Under a 0/92 plan, farmers could forego planting and still
receive 92 pct of deficiency payments.
    Rep. Arlan Stangeland (R-Minn.) and Harold Volkmer (D-Mo.)
have both expressed interest in expanding the English bill to
include a 0/92 program for feedgrains.
    An aide said Stangeland does not want to reopen the farm
bill, but to be fair to all crops.
    Only a small percentage of spring wheat farmers would
likely sign up for 0/92 since the incentives to plant are
greater than to idle the land, economists said.
    Opponents to a 0/92 feedgrains program argue it is
premature to make major changes in the farm bill and that the
House Agriculture Committee needs to study more closely the
impacts of such a program.

Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng
said the export enhancement program (eep) could be funded from
the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) if the one billion dlrs
appropriated for export bonus by Congress is exhausted.
    Lyng told reporters lack of funding should not be a
constraint on the program because USDA has the authority to use
CCC funds to continue the program. He noted Congress authorized
up to 1.5 billion dlrs for eep.
    Earlier this week, Leo Mayer, associate administrator of
USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service, said 865 mln dlrs of the
one billion in appropriated funds for eep have been used. USDA
officials said if all the eep offers announced are accepted by
importing countries the one billion dlrs would be exhausted
soon.
    Some Congressional sources have expressed concern that the
Office of Management and Budget (OMB) might try to block USDA
from seeking more than the one billion dlrs appropriated for
the program.
    These sources suggested the lack of funds might force USDA
to halt the program, which some commodity groups believe has
given a boost to U.S. exports of some farm products,
particularly wheat and wheat flour.
    However, Lyng's comments seemed to suggest that USDA could
at least temporarily continue the program using CCC funds and
would not be forced to curtail eep.

The Semiconductor Industry
Association said the February three-month average book-to-bill
ratio was 1.13 pct, compared to a revised 1.12 pct in January.
    The January figure was revised from the 1.11 pct reported
last month.
    In its monthly survey of U.S., European and Japanese
semiconductor makers, the association said average orders for
February totaled 788.2 mln dlrs, compared with 780.2 mln in
January and 684.3 mln in February a year ago.
    A book-to-bill ratio of 1.13 means that for every 100 dlrs
worth of product shipped, manufacturers received 113 dlrs worth
of new orders.
    The association said February shipments were 677.8 mln
dlrs, up 4.9 pct from the 645.9 mln shipped during January and
seven pct higher than the 633.5 mln reported in February a year
ago.
    Three month average billings for February totaled 699.4 mln
dlrs, up 0.2 pct from January's 697.8 mln, the association also
said.
    "The continuing improvement in the U.S. semiconductor
market reflects the fact that U.S. electronics equipment
manufacturers' sales are finally increasing," Semiconductor
Industry Association president Andrew Procassini said.
    The figures of the past few months suggest that the
industry is experiencing a gradual recovery that is likely to
continue, said Edward White, semiconductor analyst at E.F.
Hutton Group Inc.
    But he also said semiconductor makers still need a pickup
in capital spending within the high-technology sector before
any dramatic upturn can take place.
    The February figures show strong single-month improvement
in the semiconductor industry, but after closer examination
they may prove to be disappointing to investors, said Michael
Gumport, an analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
    "On the face of it these numbers are below recent
expectations," Gumport also said.
    A 1.15 or higher book-to-bill ratio had been expected,
Gumport said.
    He also said the three month average book-to-bill ratio,
which was reported earlier than expected, reflected a downward
revision in the December order total, Gumport said.
    December's order rate amounted to 757.5 mln dlrs, down from
the earlier-reported 783.8 mln dlrs, the association said.

car. After King was taken in custody, police found three small

A proposed buyout of Taft Broadcasting

    Jonathan Nelson, managing director of Narragansett Capital
Corp <NARR>, which is participating in the buyout plan,
declined to say if buyers have already been lined up for the
Entertainment Group. "We are considering selling the group,"
Nelson said. Wall Street analysts said any of the Hollywood

    Taft Broadcasting Co did not comment on the 145 dlr per
share offer. Taft has 9.2 mln shares outstanding, of which 12
pct are owned by the Taft and Ingalls families.
    Dudley Taft relinquished the title of president in July but
continues as vice chairman of the company.
    Taft-Narragansett requsted a response to its proposal by
March 12.
    If the plan is accepted, Taft would be a private company
financed by high yield bonds and bank debt, Nelson said.
Narragansett is an investment management company specializing
in leveraged buyout transactions.
    Taft shares climbed 19 to 151-1/2, causing arbitrageurs to
say investors believe the bidders may raise their price.
    Robert M. Bass, who controls 25 pct of the stock, and
American Financial Corp, holder of 15 pct, did not return
telephohe calls seeking comment.
    But Dennis McAlpine, analyst at Oppenheimer and Co, said "I

to sell a group of independent television stations at a loss.
He said the entertainment group, which includes the
Hanna-Barbara animation studios, is currently hampered by a
glut of animated product.
    Taft Broadcasting has never commented on reports that its
major stockholders met recently to discuss a break-up of the
company.
    MacAlpine said there are lots of options for reshaping the
company with a distribution of various pieces to the major
shareholders among the possibilities.
    Analyst Alan Gottesman of L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg Towbin

belief the company would be worth more with a change in its
strategy. He said Bass pushed for sale of the independent
television stations because the company paid too much.

Higher oil prices and stronger than
expected U.S. employment growth led to sharp losses in U.S.
interest rate futures and diminished what had been a positive
chart outlook, financial analysts said.
    The increase of 319,000 in non-farm payroll employment
during February was above market expectations for a rise of
170,000 to 200,000 jobs and sparked selling in Treasury bond
futures that drove the June contract through key technical
support at 101-2/32 at the opening Friday, they noted.
    "I don't like that fact that we had a close below 101,"
said Prudential Bache analyst Fred Leiner. The 101-2/32 level
in the June bond contract had been the top of a three-month
trading range, which when penetrated during the rally Wednesday
led to bullish forecasts by chartists.
    But analysts called it a false breakout on the weekly
charts when the June bond closed at 100-10/32 Friday.
    Some also forecast that the high of the week at 101-19/32
may signal a bearish double top formation portending steep
losses.
    "I tend to go along with the double top scenario," said
Northern Futures analyst Eileen Rico.
    Rico noted that the possible formation, along with the fact
that the rally of the last two weeks in bond futures has
occurred on relatively low volume, were negative signals.
    Despite what could be a negative chart outlook, Leiner
remains cautiously optimistic, and June bonds should find
support between 100 and 99-16/32 next week.
    The optimistic outlook, as well as Leiner's expectation
that the yield curve will flatten in the near term, is based on
an improving inflation outlook.
    With the dollar stable and economic data giving the Federal
Reserve little room to ease monetary policy, "the inflation
outlook is improving," Leiner said, and that should lead to
relatively stronger bond prices than bill and Eurodollar
prices.
    Still, Leiner noted that the recent rise in oil prices
remains a concern for the inflation outlook.
    Oil rose during the week on reports that OPEC nations were
maintaining production quotas and official prices, and got an
extra boost Friday due to the suspension of oil exports from
Ecuador after an earthquake Thursday.
    "The runup in crude oil will be a short-lived phenomenon,"
said Carroll McEntee and McGinley analyst Brian Singer.
    The rise in oil prices over the past week has been largely
"media induced," Singer said. He noted that even though OPEC
production may be within quotas, "oil stocks are at
tremendously high levels."
    Although the Ecuador situation could cause a delay, oil
prices will eventually decline to the lows of late February, he
said, and that will be a supportive influence for bond prices.

The U.S. Department of Transportation
(DOT) said it dismissed on technical grounds an application by
Trans World Airlines Inc for DOT approval for it to take
control of USAir Group.
    The DOT added, however, that TWA was free to refile when it
could put together an application for control that met the
agency's procedural requirements.
    The DOT acted shortly after the U.S. Department of Justice
disclosed that it supported dismissal of the TWA application.
    It was not immediately clear what impact the denial would
have on TWA's bid to take over USAir.
    In its control application, TWA had acknowledged that
additional documentation was required to meet DOT rules and
said it would file more material on the morning of March 9.
    But the DOT said it would not wait.
    "We have determined to dismiss TWA's application for
approval of the acquisition of USAir," it said in an order
issued late Friday.
    "TWA's application clearly fails to comply with the filing
requirements of our regulations...and TWA has provided no
reason why we should accept such a deficient filing," it added.
    "Accordingly, we will dismiss the application. TWA, of
course, may refile it when it is able to comply with our
procedural rules," the DOT said.
    The agency added that it would continue to consider a
separate TWA request for federal clearance to purchase USAir
stock through a voting trust.
    USAir had said earlier today that it asked the DOT to
dismiss the TWA control application, on grounds the TWA filing
did not meet DOT requirements.

Senior officials in the West German
coalition government said tax cuts planned for next year would
be increased by 5.2 billion marks, in line with a pledge made
by Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg at last month's
international monetary conference in Paris.
    Gerold Tandler, General Secretary of the Christian Social
Union Party, detailing the cuts at a news conference also
attended by officials from the Christian Democratic Union and
Free Democratic Party, said all of the additional 5.2 billion
mark reduction would represent net tax relief.
    An increase in revenue from other sources was not planned.
    The reductions will be added on to a package of tax cuts
already planned for 1988 amounting to some nine billion marks.
    Tandler said three billion marks of the extra tax relief
would be accounted for by reducing the rate of marginal
increase in income tax.
    An increase in personal tax allowances would save taxpayers
1.4 billion marks. Extra tax allowances for people whose
children are being educated would cut 300 mln marks from the
tax bill. A further 500 mln marks would be accounted for by
increasing the level of special depreciations for small- and
medium-sized companies.
    The extra fiscal measures planned for next year are part of
a general reform of the tax system which will come into effect
in 1990. Stoltenberg had said in Paris that part of this
reform, which will cut taxes by a gross 44 billion marks, would
be introduced next year, ahead of schedule.
    The West German government had come under pressure from the
United States to stimulate its economy with tax cuts. But
Stoltenberg said in a speech last night in Hamburg that, while
the economy would continue to expand this year, the rate of
growth was uncertain.
    The government said in January it was aiming for real
growth in Gross National Product this year of 2.5 pct, but some
economists have revised their predictions down to two or below.
    Stoltenberg said: "We remain on a course of expansion.
Whether (this will be) under two pct, as some people believe,
or around 2.5 pct as some others expect, or even closer to
three pct, as the Kiel World Economic Institute forecast a few
days ago, remains open at the moment."

Increased federal government borrowing
needs and a growing unwillingness by foreign investors to buy
mark assets could push yields in German public authority bonds
higher this year, bond market sources say.
    "At the moment we have a sideways movement in the short-term
rates. But how rates move in the long end will depend strongly
on foreigners," one portfolio manager for a large securities
investment house in Frankfurt said.
    The sources also said the government had already stepped up
its borrowing programme in anticipation on increased needs.
    Friday's loan stock was the third this year already, the
sources noted. It carried a 10-year maturity, a coupon of six
pct and price of 100-1/4 to yield 5.97 pct at issue.
    This compared with the last issue which had a 5-3/4 pct
coupon priced at 99-3/4 pct for a yield of 5.75 pct.
    But dealers said the terms were not enough to attract
foreign investors, and the federal government would have to
push yields higher in future if it wanted to borrow again soon.
    Sources noted federal government issues had also increased
in size, with the introduction of a four billion mark volume
only starting last May.
    One finance ministry economist said "It isn't more. It's
just the size (of each bond) which has increased." He added
conditions in the capital market currently remained fairly
favourable for raising new debt.
    Until recently, federal issues sold very strongly abroad,
with up to 90 pct of some being placed with foreign investors.
    With the recent stabilisation of the U.S. Dollar, however,
foreign investors have begun to back away from the market, as
hopes of further currency gains in marks diminish.
    Sources said the government has may have already stepped up
its borrowing, having raised more than 18 billion marks.
    The government made net borrowings of 23 billion marks in
1986. But Bundesbank statistics showed that net borrowing
through bonds was 26.6 billion.
    The sources said this indicated a move by the government
out of other types of debt to gain access to foreign funds
through the more acceptable loan stock form.
    Although new credit needs were partly inflated by a large
amount of issues maturing recently, other factors, including
the government's tax reduction program, would also reduce
income next year. "The problem here will be the tax reform," the
portfolio manager said.
    He added that the government's cut in its top income tax
rate to 53 pct from 56 pct in 1988 would make it difficult for
the government to reduce borrowings.
    The sources said the government would fall far short of
covering all of its 40 billion marks in lost revenue from the
tax reform by making expenditure cuts and would be forced to
fall back on debt markets in one form or the other.
    The portfolio manager noted that besides the three federal
government loan stocks so far this year, it has also fallen
back twice to raise a total 6.43 billion marks through the
issue of fixed-rate medium-term "Kassenobligation" notes.
    A finance ministry economist said the government did not
expect to have any trouble keeping to its plan to borrow only a
net 22.3 billion marks this year.
    Though many sources agreed, they added that the trend would
probably not continue next year as the further tax cuts come
into effect.
    "I would expect the efforts for a further tax reform would
mean government borrowing will increase," the manager said.
    Bond prices last week were slightly firmer on balance, with
the Bundesbank's public authority bond yield calculation
falling to 5.64 pct on Friday from 5.66 a week earlier.
    But sources said foreign demand for the new federal
government loan stock was slack, as sentiment grows that the
dollar may now rise against the mark.
    "The demand wasn't so good," a dealer for a German bank in
London said.
    The dollar's recent slight appreciation against the mark
even meant that foreign investors have sold mark bonds
recently, some dealers said.

USAir Group Inc said Piedmont Aviation
Inc has agreed to be acquired for 69 dlrs per share.
    The company, in a newspaper advertisement, said it has
started a tender offer for all Piedmont shares at that price,
and the Piedmont board, with two directors absent, has
unanimously approved the bid.  The offer and withdrawal rights
are to expire April Three unless extended, and the bid is to be
followed by a merger at the same price.
    USAir said Piedmont has granted it an irrevocable option to
buy up to 3,491,030 new shares under certain circumstances.
Piedmont now has about 18.6 mln shares outstanding.
    USAir said the tender is conditioned on receipt of enough
shares to give USAir at least a 50.1 pct interest in Piedmont
on a fully diluted basis and approval by the U.S. Department of
Transportation of a voting trust agreement permitting USAir to
buy and hold shares pending review of its application to gain
control of Piedmont.
    The company said its merger agreement with Piedmont
provides that the offer is not to be amended without Piedmont's
prior written consent in any way that would be adverse to
Piedmont shareholders, but it said it could cut the number of
shares to be bought without Piedmont's consent.
    USAir said it could reduce the number of Piedmont shares to
be purchased in the offer to no less than the minimum number
needed to cause the voting trust condition of the bid to be
satisfied.
    In that case, it said if more than that minimum number of
shares were tendered, it would buy shares on a pro rata basis.
    In February USAir had offered to pay 71 dlrs per share in
cash for 50 pct of Piedmont's stock and 1.55 to 1.90 USAir
shares for each remaining Piedmont share.

Inc <TWA> made a conditional offer to acquire USAir for 52 dlrs

<MTS Acquisition Corp>, a company
formed by Martin T. Sosnoff, said it has started a tender offer
for all shares of Caesars World Inc at 28 dlrs each.
    In a newspaper advertisement, MTS said the offer and
withdrawal rights expire April Three unless extended.
    Sosnoff, a New York investor, already owns about four mln
of Caesars' 30.3 mln shares outstanding, or about 13.3 pct, and
is Caesars' largest shareholder.  Caesars owns casino hotels in
Nevada and honeymoon resorts in Pennsylvania's Pocono
Mountains.  It also controls Caesars New Jersey Inc <CJN>,
which owns an Atlantic City, N.J., casino hotel.
    For the second quarter ended January 31, Caesars World
earned 12.6 mln dlrs on revenues of 190.4 mln dlrs, up from
earnings of 7,500,000 dlrs and revenues of 163.8 mln dlrs a
year before.  For all of fiscal 1986, the company earned 41.0
mln dlrs on revenues of 694.4 mln dlrs.
    MTS said the offer is conditioned on receipt of at least
enough shares to give Sosnoff a majority interest on a fully
diluted basis, the arrangement of sufficient financing to buy
all Caesars shares not already owned and pay related costs and
approval by the New Jersey Casino control Commission and the
NEvada Gaming Commission and State Gaming Control Board.
    MTS said Marine Midland Banks Inc <MM> has committed to
lend it 100 mln dlrs for the acquisition and use its best
efforts to syndicate another 400 mln dlrs in senior financing
for the transaction.
    It said its financial adviser, PaineWebber Group Inc <PWJ>,
has stated in writing that subject to market conditions, it is
highly confident that it can arrange commitments for up to 475
mln dlrs in "mezzanine" financing.
    MTS said it does not expect problems in obtaining New
Jersey and Nevada regulatory approval for the acquisition,
since ownership in a Caesars stake has already been cleared.
    In June 1986, Sosnoff requested a seat on the Caesars World
board, a request that has not yet been granted.  In September
1986, Sosnoff, who is chairman of <Atalanta/Sosnoff Capital
Corp>, filed for clearance under U.S. antitrust laws to raise
his interest in Caesars World to 25 pct.
    Sosnoff said, in a letter to Caesars World chairman and
chief executive officer Henry Gluck, that "The decision to go
directly to the shareholders was made at the urging of may
financial and legal advisors, who repeatedly stressed to me the
lack of responsiveness of the management in the past."
    Sosnoff, who said he has made numerous efforts to express
his views to management on ways of maximizing shareholder
values, said Caesars twicce refused his request for a board
seat.  "My advisers felt that, had I given you advance notice,
you would have used the time to throw up obstacles to my offer
rather than giving it serious consideration," he said.
    Sosnoff said he hopes that Caesars World management will be
willing to negotiate an acquisition agreement with him.
    "As I have indicated publicly in the past, I believe
operating management of the company has performed well and that
appropriate consideration should be given to a significant
equity interest for them in the company following the
acquisition," Sosnoff said in the letter to Gluck.
    MTS said Sosnoff has asked the company to fix March 27 as
the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled
to authorize action without a meeting -- including the election
or removal of directors.

Ground-breaking new systems for storing
and retrieving information are ushering in a new era for
computer companies and computer users.
    Within the past few weeks, International Business Machines
Corp <IBM>, Eastman Kodak Co <EK> and others have launched
products that radically increase the amount of data that can be
catalogued and shelved in computerized libraries.
    "This flurry of new technology could yield systems that
handle a multimedia blitz of data," said Ian Warhaftig, a
senior analyst with International Data Corp, Framingham, Mass.
    "We're developing new systems because our customers are
asking for them," Peter Giles, vice president and general
manager of Kodak's mass memory division, said in a recent
interview.
    This demand is expected to soar in coming years. While
estimates vary, industry analysts project that providing
products and services geared for information storage and
retrieval could become a 20 billion dlr a year business by
1995.
    A wide range of technologies will be needed to meet the
varying requirements of users.
    For example, a large credit verification service would want
a system from which it could quickly retrieve credit data and
relay it to its clients. A law firm, however, may need a
computerized law library in which capacity, rather than speed,
is the key feature. For architects and engineers, the ability
to store photographs, sketches and other graphics would be
crucial.
    Regardless of the specific application, the trend is toward
converting information - documents, video or film or even sound
recordings - into to the digital language of zeros and ones
understood by computers.
    Saving space is the key goal in digitizing data for
storage. An optical disk the size of a standard compact disk
can store 550 megabytes of data, or about 250,000 pages of
typewritten text.
    For this reason, the compact disk read-only memory, or
CD-ROM, is already a popular data storage media. Last week,
Microsoft introduced Microsoft Bookshelf, a 300 dlr program
that contains, on a single CD-ROM disk, a dictionary,
thesaurus, national ZIP code directory, Bartlett's Familiar
Quotations, the World Almanac and other reference works.
    Scores of such products are already on the market, but most
are specialty items, such as Lotus Development Corp's <LOTS>
CD-ROM data base of stock information for financial analysts
and investors. "Microsoft Bookshelf is important because it
marks the arrival of CD-ROM packages for the general public,"
said Ian Warhaftig of International Data Corp.
    One drawback of the CD-ROM, which uses a laser to record
and read data, is that that it requires a special player.
CD-ROM players for the retail market will appear later this
year.
    Moreover, IDC's Warhaftig said CD-ROM's will be integrated
with personal computers.
    "Eventually, CD-ROM's will fit right inside the PC box," he
said. "Imagine the advantage of having a spelling checker and
thesaurus at your fingertips when you're writing with a word
processing program."
    But CD-ROM's are just the beginning. Also last week, Kodak
unveiled several systems that use 12-inch optical disks. The
largest Kodak system uses a jukebox-like cabinet to hold up to
150 optical disks from which data can be retrieved in a matter
of seconds.
    Kodak also announced a 14-inch optical disk with 6.8
gigabytes of memory, five times the memory of a CD-ROM. The
Kodak disk, which will not be available until the middle of
1988, is designed for users who need quick access to very large
amounts of data, said Kodak's Giles.
    Meanwhile, N.V. Philips <PGLO.AS>, the Dutch electronics
giant, is preparing to take optical disk technology a step
further with the first disk that can combine text, video and
sound. Philips said the system, called Called CD-Interactive,
will be ready next year. It will include a new kind of CD-ROM
player that can hook up with a television set and stereo.
     Additional breakthroughs are expected as the next
generation of computer memory chips are introduced. Last month
IBM said it has made a four-megabyte chip, capable of storing
more data than eight CD-ROM's. Meantime, <Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone> of Japan said it has built a 16-megabyte chip.
    Analysts say commercial versions of these chips are several
years away, though some suspect that IBM may start volume
production of its four-megabyte chip sometime this year.
    Such chips will enable computer makers to build computers
with immense memory capacities.

The American Bankers Association said
the profitability of the nation's commercial banks declined by
12 pct during the first three quarters of 1986.
    During the first nine months of last year, the industry's
annualized rate of return on assets dropped to 0.68 pct from
0.77 pct in the same period in 1985, the ABA said. Return on
equity fell to 10.8 pct from 12.3 pct the previous year.
    Despite the decline in profits, the ABA said banks' capital
grew boosting the industry's capital ratio to 6.4 pct from 6.3
pct.
    The number and size of banks losing money during the period
increased significantly, the ABA said.
    During the first nine months of 1986, 17.5 pct of banks,
holding 9.6 pct of banking assets, were unprofitable, the group
said. That compares with 13 pct of banks, holding 8.8 pct of
assets, during the same period in 1985, it said.
    The industry's provisions for loan losses increased to 0.73
pct of assets during the period, up from 0.59 pct of assets
during the same period in 1985, the group said.

The American Paper Institute said the
industry is headed for another year of record volume in 1987,
with linerboard particularly strong.
    "A pro-growth trade policy, continued attention to currency
management, a fairly low interest rate climate and no major tax
increases are the essential ingredients in this outlook," Red
Cavaney, American Paper Institute president said.
    Cavaney said that so far this year the industry's
performance mimics last year's strength.
    Last year, he said, paper and paperboard production hit a
record 71 mln tons, 5.9 pct above 1985's 67 mln tons, while
industry after-tax profits in 1986 exceeded 1985 profits.
    Cavaney said that inventories will play a major role in
this year's performance.
    "Inventories, which are generally low, are a positive
factor in the industry's outlook this year," he said, citing
market pulp stocks, which are currently at 21 days supply, at
the low end of the industry's long term average.
    Cavaney added that as a result of slimmer inventories in
1986 and in the early part of this year, shipments for 1987 as
a whole will be higher than last year, even if demand slackens.
    Cavaney said, however, he expects demand this year to be
strong, spurred by consumer spending.
    The benefits of tax reform on individual after-tax income
and consumer goods companies' cash flow, he said, will increase
demand for both communications paper and packaging this year.
    In addition, Cavaney said low mortgage rates should support
high levels of housing starts in 1987, increasing demand for
many kinds of packaged goods.
    Inventory building should help demand for cartons and
corrugated containers this year, he added.
    Cavaney said he expects exports to remain fairly high in
1987, as well, as a result of the recent declines in the dollar
against major world currencies.
    But more importantly, he said, an improved balance of trade
in 1987 from the lower dollar would induce increased industrial
activity at home and thus higher packaging demand.
    Cavaney said increased competitiveness, caused by lower
costs, higher productivity and improved efficiency would also
contribute to a strong showing from the industry this year.
    Cavaney said, however, that the Tax Reform Act of 1986
could have a negative impact on the industry this year.
    "For manufacturers, the removal of the investment tax
credit creates an impediment to future investment," he said.
    Also, he said API estimates the industry will lose three
billion dlrs in cash flow over a five year period as a result
of reforms.
    "Adjustments to this loss will require time and careful
evaluation and will adversely affect the capital spending
decisions of individual companies," Cavaney said.

Southern Co said it will take an
after-tax charge of 226 mln dlrs against earnings no later than
January 1988 because the projected cost of the Vogtle nuclear
power plant has risen abover the amount which retail customers
in Georgia will be asked to pay.
    The company's largest subsidiary, Georgia Power Co, said
the budget for the plant has increased by 6.3 pct, or 522 mln
dlrs, to 8.87 billion. However, because of a pledge the made
last year to Georgia's Public Service Commission, the increased
cost will not be included in the utility's retail electric
rates.
    Geogia Power also said its board has delayed the scheduled
completion of Vogtle's Unit Two to June 1989 from September
1988. Unit Two is about 60 pct complete, it added.
    The utility said fuel loading has been completed at Unit
One and the unit is being put through a series of low-power
tests before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is asked for a
full-power license.
    The nuclear power plant, located near Waynesboro, Ga., is
co-owned by <Oglethorpe Power Corp>, the Municipal Electric
Authority of Georgia and the city of Dalton.
    Georgia Power said the revised Vogtle budget estimate was
due to several factors, including additional labor costs
incurred to keep the plant's first unit on schedule for
commercial operation by June. The new figure represents the
first change in the plant's budget since August 1985, when it
was estimated at 8.35 billion dlrs.
    In March 1986, the utility told Georgia regulators it would
"cap" the price of Vogtle its customers would be asked to pay
at 3.56 billion dlrs, the company's share of the then projected
8.35 billion dlr total. Under the new budget, Georgia Power
said, its share amounts to 3.87 billion dlrs.
    Noting that Georgia Power's share of the Vogtle increase is
313 mln dlrs, Southern said this will result in a charge
against earnings of 177 mln dlrs after taxes.
    In addition, the company said, Georgia Power's contracts
with the joint owners require the utility to buy back
significant amounts of Vogtle capacity during the plant's
initial years of operation. Under terms of the cap on costs, it
will not attempt to recover the portion of the budget increase
that applies to the buybacks.
    This bings the total amount that must be charged against
earnings to 2326 mln dlrs after taxes, Southern said.
    Southern said new rules of the Financial Accounting
Standards Board, which are effective in January 1988, require
any costs that are determined nonrecoverable to be charged
against earnings once that determination is made.
    The company also said its board has approved a capital
budget of 2.1 billion dlrs in 1987, including work on the
Vogtle project.
    It said a 5.9 billion dlr capita budget for the three-year
period 1987-1989 was also outlined at the board meeting, noting
this is 700 mln dlrs below the comparable figure for the years
1986-1988.

more than 250 mln dlrs and equity of about 284.6 mln dlrs,
allowing for a final total distribution of 16.60 dlrs per
common share.
    Continental Bank said it continues to expect that the final
distribution to shareholders will be in the range of 16.50 dlrs

Gencorp said its RKO General
subsidiary agreed to sell KHJ-TV in Los Angeles to Walt Disney
Co <DIS> for 217 mln dlrs cash plus working capital and other
adjustments at closing.
    The company said under the agreement in principle, RKO's
application to renew the station's broadcast license would be
dismissed and the competing application of Fidelity Television
would be granted. Disney would then acquire privately held
Fidelity for about 103 mln dlrs and other adjustments.
    Renewal of the KHJ-TV license has been challenged in
regulatory proceedings for more than 20 years.
    The deal is subject to prior approval by the Federal
Communications Commission, the company said.
    Late in 1985, Gencorp cut a deal with Fidelity, a Los
Angeles investor group, and Westinghouse Electric Corp <WX> to
settle the license proceedings and sell KHJ-TV for 313 mln
dlrs, 70 pct of which would go to Westinghouse and the
remainder to Fidelity. But on Jan 28, 1987, Westinghouse
withdrew from the deal because the FCC would not approve it.
    In early 1986, Gencorp and RKO agreed to sell WOR-TV in
Secaucus, N.J., to MCA Inc <MCA> for 387 mln dlrs. The FCC has
approved the transaction, but several parties have appealed.
    The FCC has not said when it would rule on the appeals,
according to a spokemsan for Akron, Ohio-based Gencorp.
    Fidelity Television originally filed a competing
application for the RKO license for KHJ, an independent
station, in 1965.
    In 1980, the FCC disqualified RKO as licensee of WNAC-TV in
Boston, citing anti-competitive trade practices and inaccurate
financial reporting to the agency, causing renewals previously
granted to RKO in New York, for WOR, and Los Angeles, for KHJ,
to be denied.

The Bank of England said it was taking
onto its books a further one billion stg tranche of 8-3/4 pct
Treasury Loan stock due 1997, payable 40 stg pct on
application. The stock was issued to the Bank at 96.50 stg pct
and will be available for dealings from March 11, with the
remainder of the amount payable on May 5. The Bank said the
bonds would yield 9.28 pct at the issue price and would be free
of tax to residents overseas. The issue would be designated
8-3/4 pct Treasury Loan 1997 "B."  A further 100 mln stg was
reserved for the National Debt Commissioners.
    The market dropped by up to 1/2 point following the Bank's
announcement, with the Treasury 13-1/2 pct stock due 2004/08
quoted one full point lower at 134-12/32 stg pct around 20
minutes after the news.
    Dealers said the announcement had to be viewed against the
backdrop of intense pressure for lower U.K. Interest rates
which had built up over the past two weeks as a result of
sterling's strength.
    The Bank this morning finally signalled it was prepared to
see lower rates and U.K. Clearing banks this afternoon
announced cuts in their base lending rates to 10.5 pct from 11
pct.
    The Bank had initially been reluctant to countenance a rate
cut because, dealers said, the authorities had wished to delay
a reduction until around the time of the U.K. Budget on March
17, thereby preserving the full impact of Chancellor of the
Exchequer Nigel Lawson's package of measures.
    However, in the face of sterling's apparently inexorable
climb, the authorities today decided to cede to pressure and
allow a half-point cut.
    Today's one billion stg tap issue was viewed by the market
as a move by the Bank to eradicate hopes for a further early
rate cut which might arise as a result of strong sterling.
    Most market participants believe that Lawson will now
foster a further half point interest rate reduction at the time
of the budget, although one or two said they would not be
surprised to see a full point decline at this stage.
    Dealers noted that as part of the authorities' attempts
last week to ease pressure for lower rates, the Bank had issued
a one billion stg tap stock with a view to subduing the
Government bond market.
    To the surprise of most participants, the issue was sold
out within hours of becoming available for trading and the
market pushed on to register further sharp gains.
    Dealers said that at this stage it seemed unlikely that the
issue announced today would be absorbed by the market as
rapidly as last week's.
    However, they noted that although sterling had edged down
from its highs following the base rate cut, it had still closed
on a trade-weighted basis at 72.4, well ahead of Friday's final
71.8 and only just beneath the peak of 72.5 touched at 1300
GMT.

Petro-Canada, Canada's
state-owned oil company, said it will drill two delineation
wells this summer at the Terra Nova oil field offshore
Newfoundland.
    Evaluation of test results and preliminary engineering work
should put Petro-Canada in a position to propose a development
plan for the Terra Nova field in 1988, the company said.
    Depending on time required for regulatory approvals,
construction could begin in 1989, with first oil production as
early as 1991, Petro-Canada said.
    "We have a high degree of confidence that the western
portion of the (Terra Nova) field contains at least 11 mln
cubic meters of recoverable oil, or more than 70 mln barrels,
and that we could produce it economicly using a floating
production system," Petro-Canada said.
    The Terra-Nova field, lying 350 kilometers east of St.
John's and 35 kilometers southeast of Hibernia field, was
discovered by Petro-Canada in 1984.
    "We've had encouraging results from the eastern portion of
the field, and we hope this summer's drilling will prove up
additional reserves there," the company said.
    Petro-Canada believes Terra Nova field is a good commercial
prospect and the company wants to move some of those resources
towards development so it can start generating a return on
investments, Petro-Canada said.
    Petro-Canada, which will act as operator of the two wells,
has a 75 pct interest in the western portion of Graven block of
the Terra Nova field and a 26 pct interest in the field's East
Flank block, a company spokesman said later. Other field
participants include Canterra Energy Ltd, Mobil Oil Canada Ltd,
Gulf Canada Resources Inc, ICG Resources Ltd, Trillium
Exploration Corp and general partnership PAREX.
    Petro-Canada estimates reserves in the Terra Nova field's
Graven block of between 68 mln and 70 mln barrels of oil,
company spokesman Bob Foulkes said from Petro-Canada's Calgary
office.
    Combined reserves for Graven Block and the field's East
Flank block are estimated between 70 mln and 130 mln barrels,
he added.
    Petro-Canada expects to spend about 500 mln Canadian dlrs
to bring the field to production by about 1991, and the
development budget could double if the company builds a
production system combining both blocks in the field, he said.
    Petro-Canada estimates the Terra Nova field Graven block
would produce between 25,000 and 26,000 barrels average daily
production, with a production system that would have maximum
capacity of 40,000 bpd, company spokesman Foulkes said in
answer to a query.
    The company estimates a production system combining both
Graven and East Flank blocks in the Terra Nova field could
produce about 45,000 bpd average daily production, he said.

A half point cut in base lending rates
was announced by the big four clearing banks today after the
Bank of England finally endorsed such a move following weeks of
downward pressure, dealers said.
    During its routine intervention in the market, the bank
trimmed the rates at which it deals with the discount houses by
half a point and National Westminster led the other clearing
banks in reducing its base rate to 10-1/2 pct from 11 pct.
    The timing of the Bank of England move took operators by
surprise after its recent action seemingly designed to dampen
hopes of a base rate cut ahead of the U.K. Budget on March 17.
       For some time, fundamentals have
led the market to push for a one point cut in base lending
rates to 10 pct but the central bank has declined to follow
wholesale money market rates down.
    Although political considerations -- the government's wish
to see a fall in base rates coincide with the Budget -- had
been suggested by operators last week as reasons for the Bank's
delaying action, worries about the real strength of sterling
and perhaps about the market's reaction to the content of the
Budget may have been behind the central bank's caution, dealers
said.
    In the event, sterling continued firm after the rate cut,
leaving the market still looking for another half point fall.
    Consequently, rates in the money market eased during the
day, one-month interbank sterling shedding 5/16 point to
10-9/16 7/16 and three-months trading 1/16 point down at
10-5/16 3/16 pct. Sterling cd's were similarly down between
5/16 point in one month and 1/8 point in one year.
    Overnight interbank money for tomorrow was indicated at
around 11 pct, almost a point below the levels ruling at the
end of last week. Today, overnight touched a high of some
11-3/4 pct after the Bank took out 228 mln stg of an estimated
300 mln stg shortage.

In an unusual move, Standard and Poor's
Corp downgraded a U.S. corporate debt issue soon after it was
priced for offering late last week.
    But, unlike a similar action in September 1986, which
investment bankers said disrupted the financing, the agency's
rate reduction had no effect this time, traders said.
    S and P announced Friday afternoon that it cut to B from
B-plus a 900 mln dlr issue of senior notes due 1994 of Holiday
Inns Inc, a unit of Holiday Corp <HIA>. The notes were priced
late Thursday by sole manager Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
    In a release, Standard and Poor's said the action reflected
a change in the note issue's terms to an unsecured form of debt
from secured. That change was made after the agency rated the
notes on February 20, S and P stated.
    "We took action as we became aware that the issue's
structure had changed," said Robert Nelson of S and P. "We
generally make a distinction between secured and unsecured
debt, and this was the key factor in our downgrade."
    A spokesman for Drexel said the action did not affect the
Holiday Inns deal, which had already sold out to investors by
late Friday afternoon.
    "The Holiday notes are trading at 100.50 on a when-issued
basis," the Drexel spokesman said soon after S and P's
announcement. The 10-1/2 pct notes had been priced at par.
    That is a far cry from late September, when S and P
downgraded a 215 mln dlr issue of subordinated sinking fund
debentures due 1998 of New World Pictures Ltd <NWP> just hours
after the pricing. Because of the rating cut to CCC-plus from
B-minus, the underwriter halted sales and repriced the issue.
    Sole manager L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin initially
gave the debentures a 12-1/4 pct coupon and par pricing. It
then repriced the issue at 97 to yield 12.74 pct.
    New World Pictures had increased the issue to 215 mln dlrs
from an original offering of 150 mln dlrs, and that brought in
S and P. The agency cited the larger financing in its action
and said it believed the issuer's cash from existing operations
would not be enough to adequately service debt.
    An officer with S and P said at the time the rating agency
was not told beforehand that the issue had been increased in
size. Usually, issuers and underwriters alert the rating
agencies to any changes in debt offerings, he said.
    In both cases, Moody's Investors Service Inc declined to
follow suit, bond traders noted.
    Indeed, Moody's announced Friday that its original rating
of B-1 for the Holiday Inns notes remained appropriate.
    Moody's pointed out that while the seven-year notes would
be unsecured obligations of Holiday Inns, the issue would
benefit from a negative pledge provision and a call for
specified collateral under certain circumstances.
    The agency also said the B-1 rating continued to recognize
a highly leveraged debt structure that would result from
Holiday's recapitalization program, as well as the company's
dependence on property sales to produce adequate cash flow for
near-term debt service.
    "Aside from Holiday Inns and New World Pictures, I cannot
remember the last time an issue was downgraded so soon after
the pricing," remarked one corporate bond trader.
    Holiday Inns also sold Thursday via Drexel 500 mln dlrs of
subordinated debentures due 1999 with an 11 pct coupon and par
pricing. The debentures' ratings of B-2 by Moody's and B-minus
by S and P were left unchanged on Friday.
    The combined offering of 1.4 billion dlrs was the
second-largest junk bond deal ever brought to market,
underwriters and traders said. They said the biggest was BCI
Holdings' 2.35 billion dlr offering on April 10, 1986.
    That the Holiday Inns deal sold out quickly underscored the
appetite of many investors for high-yield securities.
    "People are hungry for yield. They are not worried about
downside risk at all, especially for junk bonds issued by
well-known companies," said one portfolio manager.
    As a result, investors are expected to snap up this week's
planned offerings by Allied Stores Corp of 200 mln dlrs of
senior notes due 1992, rated B-2/B, and 600 mln dlrs of senior
subordinated debentures due 1997, rated B-3/CCC-plus.
    Lead underwriter First Boston Corp said Friday it has
tentatively scheduled the securities for pricing today.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture will
probably decrease its estimate of the 1986/87 Florida orange
crop today to as low as 123 mln boxes from 129 mln boxes,
analysts and industry sources said.
    The Department is scheduled to release the new estimate at
1500 hrs EST (2100 gmt) today.
    Analysts said the market is anticipating a downward
revision and much of the bullish impact has been discounted.
    The estimate, which the USDA has left unchanged since
October, should be affected this time by recent evidence of a
shortfall in the early and midseason crop now that those
harvests are complete. Analysts said based on earlier USDA
projections, the harvests should have been five to seven mln
boxes larger than they were.
    "They are going to cut their estimate," said Bob Tate, an
FCOJ broker with Dean Witter Reynolds in Miami. "The only
question is whether they will admit the whole thing in this
estimate."
    Tate said it is possible the USDA will lower its estimate
by a lesser amount, perhaps three mln boxes, and continue to
drop the estimate in subsequent reports as the crop picture
clarifies. The late season harvest, consisting mostly of
Valencia oranges, has not yet started, he noted.
    "They'll temper it," said Judy Weissman, FCOJ analyst with
Shearson Lehman Bros. "The main drop will probably come in
July."
    She expects today's estimate will be 126 mln boxes.

Rolls Royce, the U.K.'s state-owned car
and aircraft engine maker, is seeking a 250 mln stg multiple
option facility to provide it with additional sources of
financing, banking sources said.
    They said the facility, which will be syndicated among a
small group of the borrower's relationship banks, is being put
in place ahead of the privatisation of Rolls Royce in April or
May. At the borrower's request, terms will not be disclosed
until later this week, when bankers expect the syndication to
close. But while the terms are in line with the market, they
are somewhat tight, bankers said.
    The bankers noted that although Rolls Royce's debt will be
negligible after privatisation it wants to have a range of
financing arrangements available to allow it to take advantage
of market opportunities when they become available.
    The financing will involve a 150 mln stg five-year
committed tranche and will be backed by an uncommitted tender
panel through which Rolls Royce will be able to issue bills or
multi-currency advances.
    S.G. Warburg and Co Ltd is arranger for the financing, the
bankers said.

West German private banks, in the
latest twist in a long-running battle over the size of their
holdings in industry, have said the holdings were falling and
rejected calls for tighter limits on these participations.
    Under West Germany's banking system, banks can hold shares
in non-banking companies giving them seats on company
supervisory boards, and administer the holdings of small
shareholders in safe custody accounts.
    Holdings of over 25 pct, which give a veto right in the
supervisory board of a company, must be disclosed.
    "The claim that the concentration of power has intensified,
as made by the Monopolies Commission, therefore turns out not
to be accurate ... There is no reason to impose further legal
restrictions on the acquisition of holdings by banks," it said.
    The Association's letter is the latest skirmish in a long
running battle between banks on the one hand and a range of
government offices and political lobbies on the left and right.
    The number of holdings above 10 pct in public companies
with a nominal share capital of over one mln marks held by
these 10 banks fell to 86 in 1986 from 129 in 1976, it said.
    Of these 43 reductions, 41 represented holdings of over 25
pct in 1976. The banks' holdings of nominal share capital fell
to 1.70 billion marks in 1986, or 1.34 billion adjusted for
capital changes in the past 10 years from 1.80 billion in 1976.
    Over this period total West German nominal share capital
rose to 235 billion marks from 136 billion, so that the holding
of banks in German companies fell to 0.7 pct from 1.3 pct.
    The nominal share capital of listed non-bank companies rose
to an estimated 49 billion marks in 1986 from 35.58 billion in
1976, with banks' holdings falling to 1.57 billion marks or 3.2
pct from 1.61 billion marks or 4.5 pct, the Association said.
    It argued that bank representatives were in a minority on
the supervisory boards of the 100 biggest German companies, and
in most cases could be blocked by non-banking representatives.
    The survey covered Deutsche Bank AG <DBKG.F>, Dresdner Bank
AG <DRSD.F>, Commerzbank AG <CBKG.F>, Bayerische Vereinsbank AG
<BVMG.F> and Bayerische Hypotheken- und Wechsel-Bank AG
<BHWG.F>.
    It also covered Berliner Handels- und Frankfurter Bank
<BHFG.F>, <Berliner Bank AG>, <Industriekreditbank AG>,
Vereins- und Westbank AG <VHBG.F> and <Baden-Wuerttembergische
Bank AG>.
    Deutsche holds by far the largest number of such stakes,
including 28.5 pct of Daimler-Benz AG <DAIG.F>.
    Criticism of the bank holdings has not only come from the
Monopolies Commission and left-wing parties. An advisory
commission, in a report late last year to the Economics
Ministry, urged implementation of the five pct proposed by the
Monopolies Commission to promote competition and avoid interest
conflicts.
    The Economics Ministry has been controlled by the liberal
Free Democrat Party, junior partner in the centre-right
coalition government and increasingly in favour of
deregulation.
    Furthermore the West German Supreme Court recently
supported an action by a private Deutsche shareholder demanding
more transparency in the bank's balance sheet.
    The shareholder argued that the bank's ability to declare
industrial stakes of more than 25 pct as only temporary
holdings evaded the statutory requirement to report them in
full. If a bank declares stakes temporary it does not have to
disclose them but can include them under securities holdings.
    The case is due to be heard again by the Frankfurt higher
regional court.

The World Bank intends to bring
borrowing forward into the first half of 1987 because it
expects global interest rates to rise by year end, World Bank
vice president and treasurer Eugene Rotberg said.
    He told a news conference that rates in the U.S., Japan,
West Germany and Switzerland were near their lows. "The weight
of opinion is (that in a year from now) there is a higher
probability there will be one pct higher than one pct lower
interest rates," he said.
    The World Bank had not issued floating rate notes so far
this year because of the expectation of higher interest rates.
    The policy of the World Bank was to maintain liquidity at a
level that gave the bank flexibility to decide when, where and
how much to borrow, Rotberg said.
    Cash in hand was now about 50 pct of the next three years'
anticipated net requirement and comprised 25 pct of outstanding
debt and 66 pct of its debt maturing within five years.
    Although the World Bank had pioneered the swap market, it
did not intend to launch new financial instruments just for the
sake of innovation, Rotberg said.
    Of a total of 74.5 billion dlrs debt outstanding, only some
eight billion had been swapped into another currency.
    Many recent innovations were either unfair to investors or
unfair to borrowers. Until the World Bank was confident that
this was not the case, it would not adopt new instruments.
    The World Bank would raise 90 pct of the funds needed over
the next year with methods used before, Rotberg said. However,
for some 10 pct of new requirements the bank would try out new
instruments such as bonds with warrants.
    The World Bank had publicly offered 60 bonds in Germany
since the first issue was launched in 1959, he said.

U.K. Insurers could face more than 30 mln

a spokesman for Lloyds of London said.
    It could take weeks before the extent of the compensation
claims for passengers, crew and cargo was known and also before
it was known how much, if any, of the ship could be salvaged,
said David Larner of Lloyds.
    The hull and machinery of the Herald of Free Enterprise
were valued at 25 mln stg and were insured by Townsend
Thoresen's parent company Peninsular and Oriental Steam
Navigation Co Plc <PORL.L>.
    The vessel was in turn reinsured in the London market with
Lloyds and various other companies, Larner said.
    Passengers, crew and cargo were insured by the Standard
Steamship Protection and Indemnity Association, one of several
shipowners' mutual insurance funds worldwide. These were also
underwritten by Lloyds and other companies.
    Larner said claims from passengers could be expected to
total at least five mln stg, given the number of deaths and the
normal level of liability set by the Athens Convention of 1974
of between 30,000 stg and 50,000 in case of death.
    Shipping sources said, however, that these claims could
soar if a court found there was negligence or design faults
involved.
    Larner said estimates of compensation claims "were pure
guess work" at this time. But if the ship could not be salvaged,
the claims would total at least 30 mln stg.
    Shares of insurances on the London stock exchange fell
across the board in a generally weak market.
    General Accident fell 21p to 936, Royal Insurance dropped

Engineering industry
employers in North Rhine-Westphalia state said they made an
unprecedented offer on pay and working hours.
    The offer, which came amid warning strikes by some 33,000
workers, was the first time since World War Two that employers
have proposed cutting working hours and is seen as averting a
repeat of the nationwide strike of 1984 which brought the auto
industry to a standstill for seven weeks, union sources said.
    The employers propose a half-hour cut in the 38.5 hour
working week from July 1, 1988 and a pay rise of 2.7 pct from
April 1 and a further 1.5 pct from July 1, 1988.
    The engineering union IG Metall, Europe's largest union,
wants a five pct wage rise and a 35-hour week at full pay.
    It called today's warning strikes, mostly involving work
stoppages of up to one hour, after more than 50 rounds of talks
since December failed.
    The employers' offer was seen breaking the deadlock in
negotiations, even though the union said the half-hour cut is
not enough, union sources said.
    The offer applies to workers in North Rhine-Westphalia and
it was unclear if further offers would be presented in talks

proceeding very well so far, although the syndication would not
necessarily be confined to banks participating in the original
group.

that Vneshtorgbank had been very impressed by the relatively

through more traditional instruments priced in relation to
London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR).
    The facility is Vneshtorgbank's first ever

facilities in the market, since First Chicago Ltd was awarded a

Dart Group <DARTA> is likely seeking to
buy Supermarkets General <SGL>, analysts said.
    "There's been rumors that they've taken a position in the
company, said Wood Gundie analyst Edward Comeau.
    Last year, Dart Group, owner of Auto Trak INc and Crown
Books, competed against Kohlberg, Kravis to acquire Safeway
Stores INc.
    The company later reached an accord under which it would
buy 20 pct of the company after Kohlberg Kravis completed its
leveraged buyout of the company.
    The company later sold its 20 pct stock for about 180 mln
to 200 mln dlrs, according to analysts.
     Dart Group Corp was not immediately available for comment.
    Jerry Ballan, analyst with Conner Ballan division of Edward
Viner and Co, said, "They <Dart> has been rumored to be buying
some other supermarkets as well, such as Stop and Shop."
    "My guess is that Supermarkets General does not want to be
bought out," said Ballan.
    Analysts, however, said Supermarkets General is facing
problems due to its Purity Supreme and Rickels operations,
which might make it difficult to thwart a bid.
    Supermarkets General is expected to report about 1.70 dlrs
a share compared to a 1.73 dlrs a share reported for 1985 on a
post stock split basis.
    For the first quarter, Comeau predicts the company will
earn 39 cts a share from 35 cts a share a year ago, and should
earn about 2.05 dlrs for 1987.
    "But that estimation could go to a 1.80 dlrs easily, due to
Purity Supreme in New England," Comeau said.
    He said competition among supermarkets is getting heated in
that area and that the company has had difficulty with
integrating Purity Supreme with its Pathmark store operations.
    Rickels, a home center business, has faced problems due to
the state of that industry, and has reported lower returns as
an operating unit, according to analysts.
    Analysts said that if Dart buys Supermarkets General it
would probably divest the company's operations.
    Analyst Comeau said "supermarkets general may seek a
combination with another supermarket company."

This year will see a pickup in U.S.
economic growth and inflation, the Shadow Open Market Committee
said in its semi-annual policy statement.
    The SOMC, a group of basically "monetarist" private
economists, said that "economic growth will accelerate in 1987
in response to powerful stimulative actions by the Federal
Reserve."
    The group said the Fed's actions have been excessive. As a
result, it said that "inflation and ultimately another
recession now loom on the horizon."
    The SOMC said that central bank policies that rely on
progressively larger swings in monetary expansion will not lead
to sustainable economic growth and stable prices.
    The group made no specific nominal forecasts of economic or
inflation growth in its policy statement. However, the
Committee at its Sunday policy-making meeting said it was
basically in accord with projections by Jerry Jordan, who is a
member of the SOMC and economist at First Interestate Bancorp.
    Jordan expects real GNP growth to be about one percentage
point higher than in the past two years. He expects consumer
prices to rise about 4-1/2 pct this year.
    The SOMC said in recent months rapid money growth has been
a principal cause of the devaluation. To avoid another costly
inflation and disinflation, the SOMC urged the Fed to "abandon
its inflationary policy and set the growth rate of the monetary
base on the path toward sustained lower inflation."
    The Fed in February said it would no longer target the
narrow M-1 money supply because the link between M-1 and
economic growth has been largely severed.

<MTS Acquisition Corp's>
28-dlr-per-share offering price for Caesars World Inc is
thought to be much too low and is likely to attract other
suitors for the hotel/casino company, industry analysts said.
    "I think someone else will probably come in, or they (MTS)
will have to raise their bid," said Marvin Roffman, an analyst
at Janney Montgomery Scott Inc.
    MTS, a company formed by Martin Sosnoff, Caesars World's
largest shareholder, today began a tender offer, valued at
725.2 mln dlrs, for all shares Sosnoff doesn't already own.
    "I think the offer is too low by at least five points,"
said Roffman, who described Caesars World as the operator of
"one of the finest casinos in the world."
    Sosnoff, a New York investor, already owns 13.3 pct of
Caesars World's 30.3 mln shares.
    Following news of the tender offer Caesars World's shares
were trading at 27-7/8, up 3-3/8.
    A Caesars World spokesman said the company was declining
comment on the Sosnoff move for the moment, but Caesars may
issue a public statement after it has studied the offer.
    Roffman said Caesars World has considerable growth
potential and he is forecasting fiscal 1988 earnings of two
dlrs per share.
    Caesars World owns casino hotels in Nevada and honeymoon
resorts in Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains. It also controls
Caesars New Jersey Inc <CJN>, which owns an Atlantic City,
N.J., casino hotel.
    For its fiscal year ended July 31 Caesars World reported
net income of 41 mln dlrs, or 1.36 dlrs per primary share.
    The company reported second quarter net income of 12.6 mln
dlrs, or 41 cts per share, compared with income of 7.5 mln
dlrs, or 25 cts per share a year earlier.
    Daniel Lee, an analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc, said
that although Sosnoff's relatively low bid may attract other
suitors willing to pay a higher price for Caesars, there is
little likelihood that a competing bid would start a battle for
the company.

USX Corp chairman David Roderick called
for a lower value for the U.S. dollar against other currencies
to help speed a correction in the U.S. trade deficit, which
last year reached 170 billion dlrs.
    In remarks prepared for a speech before the Economic Club
of Detroit, Roderick said, "There should be total resolve that
the dollar versus other major currencies, as well as the
currencies of other nations having a substantial trade surplus
with us, must continue to decline so that the correction in our
trade deficit starts on the road to recovery."
    Roderick said the U.S. should be understanding of the
"economic pain" our trading partners experience as a result of
a falling dollar.
    But, he added, "As painful as the correction may be to our
trading partners, it is less painful than leaving the problem
uncorrected because that would lead us into an inevitable,
lengthy and steep world recession."
    Roderick said between February 1985 and December 1986 the
dollar fell by more than 40 pct in real terms against major
industrial currencies and by 30 to 35 pct against a broader
group of currencies of nearly all developing nations.
    At the end of 1986, he said, the value of foreign assets in
the U.S. exceeded the value of U.S. assets abroad by 240
billion dlrs, compared to five years ago when the U.S. had a
surplus in assets of 141 billion. A company spokesman said the
data were provided by economic consultants to USX.
    The primary reason for the trade imbalance was the 70 pct
rise of the dollar between 1980 and 1985, although other
factors were involved, Roderick said. But it is wrong, he said,
"to attribute the massive trade deficit to a fundmental
deterioration of U.S. productivity or of American product
quality."
    These areas need to be improved but they are not the root
cause of the trade gap problem, Roderick said. He urged
American manufacturers to become more competitive so they can
compete in global markets.
    In the speech, the USX chairman also called for changes in
securities laws to curb what he called abuses by corporate
raiders and speculators.
    Among his proposals, which he presented to the Senate
Banking Committee in testimony last week, were a requirement
that raiders give 24-hour notice for every one pct of stock
they acquire in a company.
    Roderick proposed that tender offers must be made for all
cash to all stockholders on equal terms and that raiders be
required to have financing in place before a tender is made.
    Further, raiders should be required to make an all-cash
tender offer once they acquire 10 pct of a target company's
stock, he said. And payment of greenmail, or a preferential
price by a target company to buy back a raider's stake, should
be prohibited under the revised laws.
    Roderick said changes were necessary to curb abuses but
that he did not want laws that would hurt the financial markets
or discourage "fair price to all" takeovers.

The London Meat Futures Exchange, LMFE,
will cease trading in its deliverable pigmeat contract from
April 3, the LMFE said.
    The move will enable the exchange to concentrate on the
cash settled contracts introduced last year.
    "This allows the exchange and its members to concentrate our
marketing on the pig and live cattle contracts," LMFE official
Peter Freeman said. "These two have already shown their
effectiveness for hedging, and the trade in both contracts is
increasing," he added.
    "Using the futures market allows better planning and forward
price fixing that our industry needs," chairman Pat Elmer said.
    Some 131 pig contracts were settled against the Meat and
Livestock Commission's Average All Pigs Price in February,
which represents hedging for over 13,000 pigs, more than twice
the number cash-settled in January, the LMFE said.
    Cash settlement on the new cattle and pig contracts was
introduced last June in the expectation that the appeal of the
futures market to farmers, abattoirs and users of meat would
increase because of the absence of a delivery requirement.

Two new eurosterling bonds were launched
today, making a total of 10 new deals in the sector so far this
month, as borrowers rush to cash in on a bull sterling market
fueled by the strength of the pound and pre-budget euphoria.
    The Bank of England finally gave way to a 1/2 point cut in
banks' base lending rates earlier today, but dealers said this
had been largely discounted and was not likely to detract from
the current popularity of sterling-denominated investments.
    "Sterling, in any shape or form, is flavor of the month and
we're set to see many more eurosterling deals," one dealer said.
    Today's new eurosterling bonds were a 10-year, 100 mln stg
deal for Sweden at 9-1/2 pct and priced at 101-1/4 pct, lead by
Baring Brothers and Co Ltd and a 14 year 60 mln stg convertible
deal for Storehouse Plc launched by SBCI International Ltd. "We
thought we saw a proverbial flood of new deals with the 14 we
had last month but it seems March will beat February hands down
with 10 already," one eurosterling specialist said.
    "Optically, psychologically, these single figures are much
more attractive for the borrower. Eurosterling looks like a
cheap and attractive way to raise your money," he added.
    This accounts for the wide variety of borrowers who have
tapped the sector recently, ranging from sovereigns such as the
Kingdom of Sweden today, continental banks including
Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank and British corporations.
    Another U.K. Merchant bank analyst noted that the current
vogue for eurosterling enabled several corporate borrowers last
month to offer paper priced below comparative gilt yields.
    A Storehouse official confirmed that the issue was aimed at
Swiss and German investors who were showing good interest.
    This is the first entry into the long term international
capital markets by Storehouse, British designer Terence
Conran's retail conglomerate which incorporates U.K. Chain
stores Mothercare, British Home Stores and Habitat.
    "We have been considering the move for quite some time now
and the current strength of the eurosterling sector provided
the perfect opportunity and spur for us to finally tap the
market," Lance Moir, corporate treasurer at Storehouse Plc told

McDonnell Douglas Corp said recent talks
with Airbus Industries about joint development and production
of a new jetliner with the European aircraft manufacturing
consortium have been very informal.
    "If there have been talks, they were casual at best," said
a source at the company. "There is nothing going on that would
lead to immediate or near-term collaboration" on a new plane.
    Senior officials at the aerospace firm's St. Louis
headquarters were unable to comment more specifically on
weekend published reports from Europe that talks about a joint
venture have resumed after they broke off last fall.
    McDonnell Douglas and Airbus last spring and summer had
discussed jointly developing and building a long-range aircraft
to compete with Boeing Co <BA> 747 wide-body jetliner, or its
successor. Talks ended when neither side wanted to forego plans
to launch its own widebody jetliner projects - McDonnell
Douglas with its MD-11 and Airbus with its A340.
    McDonnell Douglas has since launched the MD-11 jetliner, a
successor to its DC-10, and has more than 100 orders and
options.
    Airbus wants to launch its program this spring and is now
seeking customers for the long-range A340 and a companion
plane, the shorter-range A330.

With the death of Sen. Edward
Zorinsky (D-Neb.), Midwestern grain farmers have lost an ally
who from his senior post on the Senate Agriculture Committee
had fought hard against cutbacks in farm benefits.
    Zorinsky's passing could trim the Democrats' majority in
the Senate and change the makeup of the Senate farm panel.
    Zorinsky, who died of a heart attack last Friday, was the
second-ranking Democrat on the Senate Agriculture Committee and
chairman of the crucial subcommittee on agricultural production
and stabilization of prices.
    Once a Republican, Zorinsky was fiscal conservative. But he
was an outspoken critic of Reagan administration proposals to
trim target prices, and at the time of his death was girding
himself for another push for mandatory supply controls.
    If Melcher decides, however, to continue as chairman of the
subcommittee on agricultural research, conservation, forestry
and general legislation, other Democrats would have a crack at
the vacated chairmanship.
    By order of seniority, those senators would be David Pryor
(Ark.), David Boren (Okla.), Howell Heflin (Ala.) and Tom
Harkin (D-Iowa), a forceful advocate of mandatory supply
controls.

The Agriculture Department will have
to release an estimated 1.6 billion dlrs worth of in-kind
certificates, or certs, to corn farmers this fall if USDA
decides to maintain an equal split of total 1986 feedgrain
deficiency payments in cash and certs, USDA officials said.
    Final 1986 crop deficiency payments will be available to
feed grain producers in October. Wheat deficiency payments for
the 1986 crop, now complete, were made in a 50/50
cash-certificate split, and USDA officials have indicated they
want to do the same for feedgrains.
    Over 3.2 billion dlrs of an estimated 6.0 billion in corn
deficiency payments have already been announced, with 1.42
billion dlrs (43 pct) set in certificates. The final payment
must be 1.6 billion dlrs in certs (57 pct) for a 50/50 split.
    However, the release this month of almost 600 mln dlrs of
deficiency payments was equally divided in cash and certs,
doing nothing to bring up the percentage of certs.
    Some USDA analysts said the payments reflected hesitation
from the Office of Managament and Budget to allow another huge
release of certs onto the market.
    Bills are pending in Congress to move up the final
feedgrain deficiency payment to "as soon as five months after
harvest as possible," rather than the current year lag time.
    Neither Rep. Edward Madigan (R-Ill.) nor Sen. Bob Dole

forward. Aides said timing will depend on budget discussions.

The dollar will decline over the next
two to three years, but this is unlikely to result in a
complete reduction of the U.S. current account deficit, said
Anthony Solomon, chairman of S.G. Warburg (USA) Inc and former
president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
    In a presentation to the Japan Society, Solomon said
without elaboration that he expects a "significant decline in
the dollar," within the next three years.
    "The dollar will fall more, but the current account deficit
will stop being reduced when it reaches its structural core,"
he said.
    Solomon described the structural core as about one-half of
the current 150 billion dlr annual deficit. He cited several
factors which will prevent an elimination of the deficit.
    For one thing, it is unlikely that there will be any new
investment in those manufacturing industries that shrank when
the dollar was at uncompetitive levels, he said.
    In addition, he said that the U.S. has an increased
propensity to import in order to satisify consumer tastes.
    Solomon forecast inflation at 4.5 pct by year-end, but said
it could be kept below five pct in the medium-term if oil
prices are stable and commodity values remain low.

Charles DiBona said no options should be rejected to combat 
growing U.S. dependence on foreign oil.
    "No action should be ruled out--import fees or quotas,
floor prices, tax incentives or other alternatives--while a
national dialogue on the issue continues," DiBona said at a 
paper institute conference in New York today.
    DiBona said there is no unanimity within the industry on
how to stimulate energy production but there is consensus on
removing several government policies that hinder investments in
new prospects.
    DiBona said the windfall profit tax should be abolished
immediately and current proposals for increased environmental
regulations on acid rain and waste disposal should be not
adopted. He also suggested that the Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge in Alaska should be opened up for leasing to oil
companies, DiBona said.
    "This is a battle the industry cannot afford to lose if the
nation is to continue to benefit from Alaskan oil," DiBona

consumption rose and that has raised dependence on imported

A top Treasury official said he does
not expect any comprehensive Congressional reform of the U.S.
banking industry until after the 1988 presidential election due
to political pressures and, to a lesser extent, the insider
trading scandal on Wall Street.
    George Gould, Under Secretary of the Treasury, told a Wall
Street Planning Group luncheon, "legislation is not going to
happen before the election ... (people) do not like to vote on
controversial issues in election years."
    "It may take a while in the next administration ... to get
something done," he added.
    Calls for a major overhaul of the U.S. banking industry,
which would probably feature wider investment banking powers
for commercial banks, has met strong opposition from private
interest groups, such as the Securities Industry Association.
    "These discussions have nothing to do with merit ... these
groups are trying to cloak self-interest in public policy
terms," Gould said. "It is easier to stop something than it is
to get it going."
    He also described current concern about insider trading as
"a major impediment to further progress ... it is not a helpful
backdrop to accomplish financial reform."
    Similarly, Gould said lobbying by such groups as the U.S.
League of Savings Institutions would probably mean that the
Reagan Administration's proposal for the recapitalization of
the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp would be watered
down.
    Gould foresaw a five billion dlr injection over two years,
compared with the original request for 15 billion dlrs over
three years.
    Gould ruled out any new government initiative on banking
reform but said that some broad guidelines to address these
issues would be made public over the next few months.

President Reagan signed an order 
allowing sales of U.S. nuclear fuel to the European Atomic
Energy Community (EURATOM) to continue for a further year, even
though they do not comply with a 1978 U.S. law.
    Under the law, which is designed to combat the spread of
nuclear weapons, foreign importers of U.S. nuclear fuel must
get American consent to any reprocessing.
    The United States and EURATOM have had a series of 11
rounds of talks from 1978 to 1986 to renegotiate its nuclear
cooperation agreements, signed more than 20 years ago, to
conform with the 1978 law.
    Since 1978 the U.S.-EURATOM nuclear coooperation accords
have been extended by a series of presidential waiver orders.
    State Department officials said negotiations had made more
progress in the last two years after the United States had
offered a longterm reprocessing consent arrangement, rather
than requiring EURATOM to have U.S. consent for each fuel
delivery.
     In notifying Congress of today's order extending
U.S.-EURATOM nuclear cooperation, Reagan said: "A disruption of
nuclear cooperation would not only eliminate any chance of
progress in our talks with EURATOM related to our agreements,
it would also cause serious problems in our relationships."
      He said further progress in talks with EURATOM was 
expected this year.

Japan's Finance Ministry auctioned 1,000
billion yen worth of tankoku, six month debt-financing paper,
to roll over previously issued tankoku maturing on March 19, a

    The last tankoku auction, on February 12, produced a record
low yield of 3.383 pct, reflecting expectation of a half point
cut in Japan's discount rate, he said.
    In the previous auction for 1,000 billion yen, four major
Japanese securities houses took 92 pct of the issue amount in
an attempt to meet strong demand from large institutional
investors, securities managers said.
    Securities managers said they expect the auction to go well
again this time as securities houses will try to expand their
inventories of tankoku on continuing good response from

    Contrary to a projected low yield on tankoku, short-term
interest rates have been resisting a fall on growing demand for
funds ahead of the March 31 financial year-end, they said.

A one billion stg tranche of 8-3/4 pct
Treasury Loan stock due 1997 was exhausted in very early
trading on the U.K. Government bond market only minutes after
becoming available for trading, dealers said.
    The Bank of England said the issue, announced on Monday and
available for official dealings from this morning, was no
longer operating as a tap. The striking price was a partly paid
41 stg pct, at which price bids were allotted 53.8 pct.
    Dealers noted that strong demand had been detected for the
bonds yesterday afternoon and interest was further stimulated
by sterling's surge at the opening this morning.
    The issue was announced on Monday, when it was widely seen
as a move by the authorities to brake market optimism for a
further U.K. Interest rate reduction following the half-point
cut in clearing bank base lending rates to 10.5 pct earlier in
the day.
    Dealers said that the Bank's strategy succeeded in stemming
pressure for a further rate reduction only briefly, as the
market yesterday recovered all the ground it lost on Monday
immediately after the announcement.
    Demand for the issue was lively from U.K. And overseas
sources, with particular interest seen from Japan.
    The bonds were issued at a price of 96-16/32 stg pct,
partly paid as to 40 stg pct on application, although the
Government broker this morning sold them at a premium of one
stg pct over the partly paid issue price.
    The issue has been designated the "B" tranche of the bonds,
since 1.3 billion stg of 8-3/4 pct Treasury Loan stock due 1997
is already in issue.
    Dealers noted that the Bank of England last week issued one
billion stg of nine pct Exchequer bonds due 2002 in an effort
to dampen enthusiasm for an interest rate reduction caused by
sterling's uptrend on foreign exchange markets.
    Last week's issue was sold out on its first day of dealings
but with nothing resembling the determined demand seen this
morning for the new tranche of bonds, dealers said.
    After stifling pressure for a rate cut last week, the
authorities finally sanctioned a base rate reduction on Monday,
following it up with the announcement of the one billion stg
bond issue.
    Sterling was briefly depressed by the rate cut but this
morning opened very strongly again, starting on a
trade-weighted basis at 72.6 against yesterday's final 72.1 and
later edging up to 72.7.
    U.K. Money market rates declined again this morning by up
to 1/8 point, strongly reinforcing yesterday's speculation that
clearing bank base lending rates could drop into single figures
after the budget next Tuesday, money market dealers said.
    U.K. Government bond dealers noted that under the influence
of stronger sterling and the further fall in money market
rates, prices this morning had opened as much as 3/4 point
higher at the longer end of the market.

The yen's rise against the dollar is
expected to boost Japan's unemployment rate to an average 3.3
pct in the 1987/88 fiscal year beginning April 1 from January's
record three pct, the private Nomura Research Institute said.
    The official 1987/88 estimate is 2.9 pct.
    The research arm of Nomura Securities Co forecast
unemployment would exceed two mln by mid-fiscal 1987, against
an estimated 1.75 mln for the current year.
    Nomura urged the government to take pump-priming measures
to help redress trade imbalances and boost employment.
    Employment in manufacturing during fiscal 1987/88 was
predicted to fall 550,000 from the current year due to higher
job losses in the steel, shipbuilding and heavy electrical
machinery sectors, Nomura said.
    Employment in the non-manufacturing sector will continue to
increase, the institute said, without giving figures.

Japanese car makers will curb their
exports to the European Community (EC) following an unofficial
directive from the Ministry of International Trade and Industry
(MITI), automobile industry sources said.
    Some sources said exports to the EC this year are likely to
be at most unchanged from last year's 1.10 mln units and may
even fall due to an anticipated slackening of EC economic
growth and increasing trade friction.
    Last week, MITI vice minister for international affairs
Makoto Kuroda said the ministry had asked car makers to
exercise prudence in exporting to Europe.
    Japanese car makers boosted exports to the EC in January to

from a year earlier to 174,133 units.

curbed shipments to meet an earlier directive from MITI to

Ultramar Plc <UMAR.L> said that while
its fourth 1986 quarter had improved from the operational point
of view, several special charges adversely affected results.
    Overall the year had not been a good one, with upstream
operations dramatically hit by the fall in crude oil prices and
downstream operations also affected in the first half by large
losses on inventories.
    But margins improved in the second half and in particular
refining and marketing in Eastern Canada showed a good
recovery.
    The company was commenting on results that showed a net
loss for the year of 62.1 mln stg after a 71.6 mln profit in
1985.
    The fourth quarter charges included a 20.8 mln stg
provision on a retroactive price agreement recently initialled
by Pertamina and Japanese buyers of the company's liquid
natural gas and 4.7 mln for the early months of its ownership
of Gulf Canada's marketing assets.
    Ultramar said it had also included the estimated cost of a
further reorganisation programme, which was partly offset by a
withdrawal of surplus funds from U.S. Pension schemes, and a
13.5 mln stg provision for the estimated cost of selling its
U.S. Flag shipping operation.
    The immediate outlook for crude oil prices was uncertain
although it was unlikely there would be any sizeable increase
in the near term. However, Ultramar said it was optimistic
prices would strengthen over the longer term.
    Its substantial reserves of crude oil and natural gas put
it in a good position to benefit from any price recovery.
    In the meantime, Ultramar's objectives were to improve
profitability by selling or restructuring weak operations while
strengthening core businesses and developing a sound
operational and financial base.
    Proven, probable and possible reserves at end-1986 totalled
about 700 mln barrels net on an oil-equivalent basis.
    Ultramar shares firmed on the announcement to 187p from
181p at last night's close.

Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone will
step down only after his plan to overhaul Japan's tax system
gets parliamentary approval, one of his closest aides said
today.
    The aide, who declined to be identified, said at a private
meeting, "Nakasone's power in office does not necessarily
terminate at the end of his term in October. It depends on when
(the) seven tax reform bills get parliamentary approval."
    Nakasone vowed yesterday to press on with his plan despite
Sunday's unexpected Upper House by-election defeat of the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in a conservative
stronghold.
    The socialist winner, backed by other opposition parties,
had campaigned against a controversial five pct value added
sales tax, the main plank of the reform plans.
    The aide dismissed the possibility of any amendment of the
sales tax on the grounds the opposition parties were demanding
nothing but retraction of the tax.
    They have been refusing to discuss a draft budget for the
1987 fiscal year starting on April 1, which includes the tax
plans. They have been resorting to an on-off boycott of
parliament since February 4.
   "If I were Nakasone, I would close the current regular
parliamentary session on May 27 as scheduled, attend the Venice
summit of industrial democracies in June and open an
extraordinary session to discuss the tax plans," the aide said.
    Under law, a regular session can be extended only once
while an extraordinary session can be extended twice.The other
option would be to extend the current session, he said.
    "The opposition parties will surely present a no-confidence
motion against the Nakasone Cabinet at one stage or another."
    One scenario then will be to reject the motion opening up
the way for tax reform.
   "Another scenario is the resignation of the Nakasone Cabinet
en masse. A third scenario is a dissolution of the Lower House
for a snap general election," the aide said.
    That is only possible if the 200 opposition members resign
from the 512-seat Lower House, necessitating by-elections.
    The LDP now has 304 seats in the Lower House after its
landslide victory in general elections last July.
    There are five independents and three vacancies.
    "The LDP which will put up candidates will certainly inflate
their seats, but at the expense of fierce media criticism," the
aide said.
    He said he expected the proposed sales tax to have little
effect on local elections to be held on April 12 and 26.
    About 2,600 elections will be held in all but three of the
nation's 47 prefectures including 13 gubernatorial elections.
    "Candidates running in prefectural assemblies will all
oppose the sales tax irrespective of their party tickets.
    "Possible effects, if any, will be on gubernatorial
elections in Japan's northernmost island of Hokkaido and
Fukuoka in southern Japan," he said.
    The two posts are now held by opposition socialists.

A spokesman for Preussag
AG <PRSG.F> said it was not yet certain whether the company
would pay a dividend on 1986 results
    He was commenting on a Preussag statement which said
results in 1986 were lower than in 1985. Preussag has
frequently said its results came under further pressure in 1986
following a difficult year in 1985.
    Managing board chairman Guenther Sassmannshausen said in
December the board would prefer to stick to its policy of not
dipping into reserves to pay dividends. The spokesman noted the
final dividend decision rests with the supervisory board.
    The Preussag statement said results fell in 1986 compared
with 1985 because declines in earnings in metals, oil and
shipping were not entirely compensated by positive trends in
the group's other divisions.
    The spokesman said it was not clear whether the domestic
group would show a net profit in 1986, adding this would depend
partly on the level of provisions.
    Preussag cut its 1985 dividend to eight marks from nine
marks on 1984 results after parent company net profit dropped
to 65.0 mln marks from 103.0 mln the year before.
    The Preussag world group made a net loss of 13.1 mln marks
in 1985 after a net profit of 154.5 mln the year before.
Domestic group net profit fell to 77.9 mln from 122.2 mln.
    The statement said its results in 1986 were affected by
unsatisfactory selling prices for metals and oil as well as by
poor use of capacity in the supply ship sector.
    The reduction in natural gas prices in the fourth quarter
of 1986 to reflect earlier falls in oil prices was an
additional factor behind the drop in results.
    Preussag said rationalization measures already introduced
would not begin to take full effect until this year.
    Preussag's domestic group turnover rose to 4.48 billion
marks in 1986 from 4.29 billion in 1985, helped by the first
time consolidation of 951.8 mln marks of turnover from its
majority-owned oil and gas subsidiary C. Deilmann AG.
    Domestic group turnover in the 1986 fourth quarter alone
was 1.1 billion marks, it said without giving comparison
figures.
    Preussag said its domestic crude oil production fell 4.0
pct to 94,400 tonnes in 1986, while foreign oil production rose
to 182,900 tonnes from 174,500 tonnes.
    Preussag said its Amalgamated Metal Corporation Plc (AMC)
subsidiary, whose results are included in the world group
accounts, made an unspecified profit in the fourth quarter of
last year.
    AMC's large losses in 1985, caused principally by the
international tin crisis, were the reason behind the world
group losses that year.

Call money eased to 3.75/80 pct from
3.80/85 yesterday following a net injection of 6.7 billion
marks at a rate of 3.80 pct in fresh funds from this week's
securities repurchase agreement, dealers said.
    But rates were expected to rise toward the end of the week.
    A major tax payment period by banks on behalf of customers,
payments for the federal railways loan stock and repayments of
mark liabilities incurred by foreign central banks with the
Bundesbank in the framework of the European Monetary System
(EMS) are likely to significantly burden the system. Banks
built up minimum reserves today, ahead of the expected outflow.
    The Bundesbank credited banks with a gross 15.2 billion
marks, but some 8.5 billion left the system at the same time as
an earlier securities repurchase pact matured.
    Dealers estimated the EMS related outflow as high as six
billion marks.
    The Bundesbank declined to comment, but a spokesman said
yesterday although the funds now due may be allowed to roll
over, the possibility that other central banks may choose to
redeem them meant a net infusion was needed.
    Dealers forecast tax payments of 25 and 30 billion marks,
but much of it is expected to burden the system only next week.
    Banks' minimum reserve holdings at the Bundesbank totalled
53.6 billion marks on Monday, averaging 54.0 billion over the
first nine days of March.
    Dealers said although the figure was well above an expected
requirement of around 51 billion marks, the expected outflow of
funds was so large that banks might find it difficult to meet
the requirement toward the end of March.
    No securities repurchase agreement is expiring next week,
but dealers said the Bundesbank could offer fresh liquidity if
conditions significantly tighten. "The Bundesbank wants to keep
rates around 3.80 pct," one dealer said.

Borrowing on the international capital
markets rose moderately in February with 25.9 billion dlrs of
medium and long term funds raised, up 1.5 billion from January
and up 3.2 billion from February last year, the Organisation
for Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD, said.
    Borrowing on external bond markets totalled 20.8 billion
dlrs, some 2.8 billion more than in January, the OECD said in
its latest monthly report.
    But the market for floating rate notes (FRNs) saw further
serious difficulties and the volume of new offerings was only
1.4 billion dlrs against a 1986 monthly average of 4.2 billion.
    However, the OECD said, issues of straight bonds and
especially equity-related issues continued at a brisk pace.
    As in January, exchange rate uncertainties had a major
impact on the currency composition of new bond issues, with
issues in dlrs totalling only 6.5 billion against a monthly
average of over 10 billion dlrs in 1986.
    "The share of the U.S. Dollar in total external bond
offerings has fallen below 32 pct this year - the lowest figure
in the present decade," the report said, but added that the
market has absorbed a record volume of yen offerings.
    In the syndicated credit market, the volume of new loans
declined to 3.9 billion dlrs in February from 4.7 billion in
January. Activity on the market for note issuance and other
back-up facilities continued to be particularly subdued with a
total of only 1.2 billion dlrs completed in February, some 500
mln dlrs less than the already depressed figure for January.
    In February, OECD borrowers accounted for some 85 pct of
total borrowing with major borrowers including the U.S. With
4.5 billion dlrs, Japan, 3.1 billion, and France with two
billion, in addition to a one billion dlr refinancing for
electricity board EDF.

The yen's rise against the dollar is
expected to boost Japan's unemployment rate to an average 3.3
pct in the 1987/88 fiscal year beginning April 1 from January's
record three pct, the private Nomura Research Institute said.
    The official 1987/88 estimate is 2.9 pct.
    The research arm of Nomura Securities Co forecast
unemployment would exceed two mln by mid-fiscal 1987, against
an estimated 1.75 mln for the current year.
    Nomura urged the government to take pump-priming measures
to help redress trade imbalances and boost employment.
    Employment in manufacturing during fiscal 1987/88 was
predicted to fall 550,000 from the current year due to higher
job losses in the steel, shipbuilding and heavy electrical
machinery sectors, Nomura said.
    Employment in the non-manufacturing sector will continue to
increase, the institute said, without giving figures.

Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita
said there is little room left for the central bank to further
ease its credit policy as interest rates levels are now
approaching their lower limit.
    "The government should instead seek ways of making the best
use of its fiscal policy," he told a press conference.
    His remarks were concerned with a comprehensive economic
stimulative package the government plans to adopt in the coming
days.
    At the recent talks among the six major industrialised
nations in Paris, Japan promised to work out a comprehensive
economic package to boost domestic demand, which in turn would
help increase its imports and reduce its trade surplus.
    Sumita also said the economy will show a gradual upturn in
the second half of the year if the yen remains stable.
    He said there is caution in the foreign exchange market
against a further rise of the yen and mark and this explains
the recent stability in the currency markets. Conflicting
economic indicators from the U.S. Have also been dampening
market activity, he added.

The Finance Ministry said its auction
yesterday of 1,000 billion yen of tankoku, six-month debt
financing paper, produced a record low average yield of 3.246
pct on aggressive bidding from securities houses.

European Community
Commission President Jacques Delors said he met with strong
objections from some EC government heads to his radical plan
for changes to Community financing.
    In a speech to the European Parliament, Delors said some EC
leaders told him on a recent tour they could not easily allow
additional resources for the bloc when they were themselves
pruning their own spending.
    Others called for major spending cut in the EC's
controversial farm policy in order to free money for regional
and social development.
    The Parliament later registered its support for the Delors
plan by voting to approve his continuation in office for a
second two-year term.
    Delors has proposed that payments by member states to the
EC should be based on their gross national product instead of
on the amount of value added tax they receive. He said this
would increase EC resources and provide a fairer system of
sharing the financial burden.
    He told the Parliament that in reply to complaints about
increased payments, he had told some heads of government the
Community needs more money.
    Delors said he agreed with leaders who argued the need to
reform the EC farm policy, which currently accounts for over
two thirds of the 41 billion dlr annual budget."We have to ask
for sacrifices but we have to create a future for those
farmers."
    He added, "I was forced to say to some heads of government -
Do you want to destroy this common market in agriculture when
you are asking for a common market in goods and services?"
    EC leaders have set 1992 as a target for creating a genuine
internal market in industrial products and services.
    Delors said the people had to be convinced that increasing
group resources did not necessarily mean raising their taxes.

Lower production of coconut
and palm oils could lead to a decline in vegetable oil stocks
this year despite growing supplies of oilseeds, senior oilseeds
analyst for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Mario Balletto said.
    Balletto told a conference of Canadian farmers at Alberta
Agriculture's annual farm outlook conference that the world
vegetable oil situation is one of potentially tight supplies.
    "Prices for edible oils appear to have more upside
potential reflecting strong world demand and an unprecedented
decline in the production of tree oils," Balletto said.
    Balletto estimated production of palm, coconut and palm
kernel oils this year at 8.5 mln tonnes, down from 9.1 mln
tonnes last year, enough to offset higher oilseed output.
    He estimated total vegetable oil production this year at
33.4 mln tonnes, up from 33.0 mln last year, and disappearance
at 34.0 mln tonnes, up from 32.6 mln.
    Unless oilseed crushing increases sharply, he said,
disappearance of vegetable oils could exceed production by
600,000 tonnes, the largest deficit since 1976.
    "If world protein meal demand stagnates, thus limiting the
crush of soybeans ... the need for serious supply rationing in
the edible oils sector could develop," he said.
    "This would be relatively favorable for the prices of high
oil yielding seeds," Balletto said.
    Oilseeds, on the other hand, remain at depressed prices
because of burdensome supplies, he said.
    World ending stocks of oilseeds are estimated to increase
for the fourth straight year to a record 28.4 mln tonnes,
compared with 25.4 mln last year.
    The increase should result from lower disappearance, as
production is expected to fall to 184.0 mln tonnes from 185.7
mln last year, he said.
    World soybean production in 1987 totalled a record 98.9 mln
tonnes, up from 90.6 mln the previous year, Balletto said,
while production of other oilseeds was lower.
    Higher soybean production in South America and Europe made
up for lower production in the United States, he said.
    Soybeans account for the bulk of the surplus, and U.S.
stocks make up most of those, Balletto said.
    The Commodity Credit Corporation owned 12.7 mln tonnes,
about half of the world soybean surplus, he said.
    Since 1983-84, he said, world oilseed stocks have increased
13.1 mln tonnes.
    "During the same period, U.S. soybean stocks increased 12.1
mln tonnes, becoming the dumping ground of the entire world
surplus, courtesy of the CCC and highlighting the artificially
high prices caused by the U.S. loan program."
    "Soybean prices and, to a great extent, world oilseeds
prices are likely to be dominated by the loan program, as long
as the U.S. soybean surplus continues.
    For the 1987 crop, he said, prices are likely to hover in a
range tied to the U.S. loan program.
    "Upside potential for prices is limited by the huge supply
overhang while strong underlying support is provided by the
U.S. loan rate."
    The problem is likely to become worse as the artificially
high prices encourage producers in South America, Canada and
Australia to shift from grains to oilseeds, Balletto said.

The Reagan administration is totally
opposed to recent Democratic suggestions that securities
transactions should be taxed to help curb the budget deficit,
an administration official said in an interview.
    "We're totally opposed to a securities transfers tax. It
would impair the efficiency of some of the most efficient
markets in the world," he said. He declined to be named.
    In recent days House Speaker Jim Wright, a Texas Democrat,
has called for such a tax to raise the 20 billion dlrs he
estimates is needed to meet legal deficit reduction targets.
    "It would fall primarily in my view not on wealthy
individuals but on middle income people who occasionally invest
and trade. So I think it's a very bad idea," said the official,
who is an administration economic policy-maker.
    The official also rejected a suggestion by Wright that the
administration delay next year's cut in top tax rates, called
for in the recently-passed overhaul of the U.S. Tax system.
    "It is breaking faith with the American people ... It would
be a real breach of faith," he said.
    The Gramm-Rudman Hollings law calls for a balanced budget
by 1991, but its power has been reduced in the Supreme Court.
    Wright and other Democrats say even if they pass President
Reagan's budget proposals for the fiscal year starting this
October, they would miss by some 20 billion dlrs the 108
billion dlr target for the budget deficit set under the
Gramm-Rudman law.
    The administration puts the deficit at 173.2 billion dlrs
in the current fiscal year and claims that spending cuts and
revenue increases will achieve the Gramm-Rudman goal.
    The official, who is knowlegeable on budget strategy, also
said President Reagan was still opposed to a so-called 'budget
summit' with Congress to resolve the deficit issue.
    The suggestion of a 'budget summit' emerged again recently
after Democrats and Republicans alike said Reagan needed a
deficit reduction package and an arms control accord with
Moscow to rebuild his presidency after the Iran arms scandal.
    But the official dismissed the budget summit idea as an
attempt by the Democrats to secure a tax increase. He accused
them of being overly critical before they had written their own
budget proposal, due out on April 1.
    "It's easier to write a book review than it is to write a
book. We've written a book and the Democrats are writing a book
review every day. Let's see their book," he said.

U.S. banks and savings and loan
institutions could face important changes as a result of
emergency legislation adopted overwhelmingly by the Senate
Banking Committee.
    The bill approved 12-6 yesterday would rescue the
underfunded federal deposit insurance fund for thrifts and
temporarily halt new developments in the provision of financial
services.
    The bill, which goes to the full Senate, will infuse a
badly needed 7.5 billion dlrs into the Federal Savings and Loan
Insurance Corp., which insures accounts of depositors.
    It also limits banks' ability to sell securities and
restricts a new breed of competitor, the so-called nonbank
banks.
    Committee Chairman William Proxmire, the bill's sponsor,
promised the committee will work on a long-term plan for new
developments in the financial services industry, which is
confronted by growing competition from firms in other
commercial centers, such as London and Tokyo.
    "This bill we are taking up today is the first step in this
effort," the Wisconsin Democrat said.
    But Sen. Jake Garn, the committee's top Republican,
chastised senators for imposing temporary restrictions on
financial providers.
    "It is time to forget the special interests," the Utah
senator said.
    Garn failed to win approval for an amendment that would
have eliminated virtually all of the bill's provisions except
the rescue for FSLIC.
    A major controversy focused on nonbank banks, which offer
limited financial services of a bank and avoid most banking
regulations.
    Proxmire succeeded in closing a loophole which would permit
new nonbank banks and thrifts until Congress passes
comprehensive bank reform, a move welcomed by the bank
industry.
    But at the same time, the bill set a moratorium on a number
of new activities that banks may undertake, including selling
insurance, securities and real estate for one year after the
bill becomes law.
    The 7.5 billion dlr rescue for FSLIC represented a
compromise between a larger amount sought by the Reagan
administration and a smaller figure proposed by the thrift
industry.
    The U.S. League of Savings Institutions, an industry group,
feared approval of a larger amount for FSLIC would lead to a
surge of closings of thrifts by federal superviors.
    "We hope the Congress will finally settle on a lower number,"
William O'Connell, president of the league, said after the
committee voted.

The oil services industry is on the
verge of a recovery because of rising crude prices, oil
industry analysts said.
    The analysts, who issued buy recommendations on some
stocks, said the recovery in oil services should begin in the
second half of 1987, after drilling activity bottoms out in the
first half, and continue into the next decade.
     "People, however, cannot afford to wait for drilling to go
up to start buying," said Sandi Haber Sweeney, senior research
analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein and Co Inc.
    Among the recommended buys are Schlumberger Ltd <SLB>,
Halliburton Co <HAL>, Dresser Industries <DI>, Baker
International <BKO>, and McDermott International Inc <MDR>,
which may be the target of a takeover by Harold Simmons, a
Dallas-based investor.
    Analysts said although major oil companies are increasing
exploration and development overseas, they expect the pickup in
oil services will begin in the U.S.
    "Activity in the U.S. is so depressed it should move up
faster," said Vishnu Sharp of Goldman Sachs.
    The number of active oil drilling rigs in the U.S. was 766
last week compared with 1,212 rigs one year ago, Huges Tool Co
<HT> figures show.
    The average number of working rigs in the U.S. for 1987 is
projected at 978 versus 964 in 1986, according to Ike Kerridge,
vice president of stockholder relations at Hughes Tool. "The
first significant pickup in drilling activity will occur in the
second half of 1988," Kerridge said.
    Overseas drilling activity is expected to follow a similar
pattern, Kerridge said.
    "Halliburton is the best value," said Jeffrey Freedman,
vice president at Smith Barney, Harris and Upham Inc, adding
the company controls the greatest amount of liquidity of common
stock market value, is diversifed in non-oil field businesess,
and has the lowest multiple of stock price to operating cash
flow including debt.
    Schlumberger is Freedman's second favorite oil service
stock.
    "Schlumberger is expected to continue to be the dominant
technical leader in the industry," Freedman said.
    "Schlumberger's management shift, asset restructuring,
including a pending merger of Fairchild Semiconductor, and its
considerable cash horde sets the stage for the company to
maximize its significant industry advantage and capitalize on
the project upturn in exploration and development activity,"
according to a report by George Gaspar, first vice president at
Robert W. Baird and Co Inc.
    Gaspar estimates earnings per share for Schlumberger at 25
cts for 1987 and one to 1.75 dlrs in 1988 compared with 20 cts
in 1986 excluding a fourth quarter special charge of 1.87
billion dlrs.
    Bernstein's Sandi Sweeney is recommending a group of oil
service companies and said choosing among them is difficult.
Her favorite is Baker International, which is involved in a
possible merger with Hughes Tool Co.
    Dresser Industries will also benefit from the recovery but
possibly not as much as other companies because it is not a
pure service company, Sweeney said.
    Dresser is expected to improve profitability owing to cost
reductions and streamlined operations, including the sale and
leaseback of its headquarters, said Swarup.

St. Joe Gold Corp said it plans to
proceed with development of its Golden Patricia gold property
in northwestern Ontario.
    It said about five mln dlrs will be spent to continue
underground development and obtain operating permits and
another 10.2 mln dlrs is expected to be required to complete
underground development, construct a mill and provide the
infrastructure needed to put the mine into commercial
production.
    St. Joe Gold said if the necessary operating permits were
granted in time, it would start gold production in the second
half of the year ending October 31, 1988 at an annual rate of
about 40,000 troy ounces.
    The company said the property is estimated to contain over
500,000 troy ounces of gold, and the initial mining project
covers only seven of 192 claims, with drill-indicated reserves
of 293,000 short tons grading 0.88 troy ounce of gold per ton.
    It said initial mine output is expected to be about 150
tons of ore daily.
    St. Joe Gold said the Golden Patricia vein has not been
tested at depth or along strike to the east and west and
exploration is continuing on the Golden Patricia property and
the adjacent wholly-owned Muskeg Lake property.
    The company also said its Richmond Hill gold and silver
deposit in the Carbonate district of western South Dakota has
been shown by drilling to contain about 3,900,000 tons grading
0.055 troy ounce of gold and 0.23 troy ounce of silver per ton.
 It said preliminary results are encouraging and a feasibility
study is nearing completion.

Hughes Tool Co said its board voted at
a special meeting last night to approve a new agreement with
regulators that would allow the company to complete its
proposed merger with Baker International Corp <BKO>.
    The agreement, approved by the U.S. Department of Justice
yesterday, will give the merged company, Baker Hughes, six
months instead of three to sell certain assets.
    The pact also allows a three-month extension, if warranted,
and limits the obligation of the new company to give financial
support to the businesses to be divested, pending their sale.
    The company said its board recommended that shareholders
approve the merger of the oilfield service companies. A
previously adjourned meeting of Hughes Tool stockholders will
be resumed this afternoon, it said.
    "Hughes will work with Baker and the Justice Department
towards negotiating the final form of the consent decree and
filing it as soon as possible," the company said in a
statement. Closing of the merger would occur immediately after
the filing, it said.
    The assets to be sold under the consent decree consist of
Baker's domestic oilfield drilling bit business and its
domestic submersible electric pump business. Baker has an
agreement to sell the pump business to Trico Industries Inc
<TRO>.
    The financial terms of the merger are unchanged, a Hughes
spokesman said. Under those terms, each Baker common share and
Hughes common share would be converted into one share and 8/10
of a share, respectively, of Baker Hughes Inc, which would be
formed as a new holding company.

    Tate and Lyle is seeking approval in Canada, the United
Kingdom and other European countries, Johnson and Johnson said.
The company noted its petition covering the product and its
safety evaluation were submitted to the FDA last month.
    While awaiting FDA approval, the company said, it is
proceeding with plans for commercialization through its McNeil
Specialty Products Co subsidiary.
    Johnson and Johnson said it is operating under a licensing
agreement with Tate and Lyle, whose collaborative research with
scientists at Queen Elizabeth College in London led to the
discovery of Sucralose in 1976.
    Patents and licensing agreements control the use of
sucralose through the year 2001, Johnson and Johnson said.
    Sucralose is a chlorinated derivative of ordinary sugar.
The carbon-chloride bonds in sucralose are stable and are not
broken during digestion or metabolism.
    Sucralose is essentially not metabollized by the body. The
chlorine content enhances sweetness without providing calories.

The U.S. merchandise trade deficit
on a balance of payments basis was a record 38.37 billion dlrs
in the October to December fourth quarter, the Commerce
Department said.
    The record trade shortfall came after a revised 37.15
billion dlr third quarter deficit. The department previously
reported the third quarter deficit was 37.67 billion dlrs.
    For the full year 1986, the merchandise trade deficit was a
record 147.7 billion dlrs, up from 124.4 billion dlrs in 1985,
the department said.
    During the final quarter last year imports rose 2.78
billion dlrs or three pct to 95.7 billion dlrs, while exports
rose 1.56 billion dlrs or three pct to 57.33 billion dlrs.
    The trade report on a balance of payments basis excludes
such factors as military sales and the costs of shipping and
insurance.
    The Commerce Department said non-petroleum imports in the
quarter were up 2.7 billion dlrs or three pct to 87.7 billion
dlrs, with the largest increases in consumer goods, which rose
1.2 billion dlrs, and in non-monetary gold and passenger cars
from Canada, up 900 mln dlrs each.
    Lumber imports from Canada fell 300 mln dlrs or 33 pct
because of a 15 pct duty on imports from Canada, the department
said. Passenger car imports fell 600 mln dlrs because of an 18
pct decrease in the number of South Korean-made imported cars
and a nine pct decrease from Japan.
    On the exports side, agricultural exports rose 600 mln dlrs
or nine pct to 7.1 billion dlrs, primarily because of a 104 pct
or 600 mln dlr increase in soybean exports.
    Soybean shipments to Western Europe rose sharply because
supplies from Brazil, a traditional major exporter, were
limited by drought.
    Commerce said the U.S. trade deficit with Latin America
rose 900 mln dlrs to 2.6 billion dlrs, with Japan increased 700
mln dlrs to 14.8 billion dlrs and with Western Europe rose 200
mln to 7.2 billion dlrs in the quarter.
    The deficit with newly industrialized Far East countries,
including Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan, fell
500 mln dlrs to eight billion dlrs and with Canada the deficit
decreased 200 mln dlrs to 3.3 billion dlrs in the quarter.
    In the full year 1986, imports rose 30.6 billion dlrs or
nine pct to 369.5 billion dlrs. Exports increased by only 7.3
billion dlrs or three pct to 221.8 billion dlrs.
    Commerce said petroleum imports during 1986 fell 16.6
billion dlrs or 33 pct to 33.9 billion dlrs because of lower
prices. The average price per barrel decreased to 14.72 dlrs
from 26.41 dlrs.
    Agricultural exports fell by 2.6 billion dlrs or nine pct
to 26.9 billion during the year. The average price of rice fell

Bilfinger und Berger-Bau
AG <GBFG.F> expects group construction output in 1987 to fall
to around 2.5 billion marks in 1987 from 2.73 billion last year
and sees foreign business stabilizing just under its 1986
level.
    In a letter to shareholders, Bilfinger und Berger said
foreign construction work fell to 1.37 billion marks in 1986
from 2.10 billion the year before. It said the drop was due to
a fall in orders and the dollar's decline against the mark.
    The firm expects good 1986 results, with an appropriate
dividend. In 1985 group net profit fell to 14.1 mln marks from
22.6 mln in 1984 and the dividend lost one mark to nine marks.
    Bilfinger und Berger's U.S. Units took up 600 mln marks of
its total foreign construction output.
    The company said domestic earnings in 1986 improved
slightly despite strong competition, due to efforts to avoid
taking on orders which would not break even.
    Foreign earnings were hit by the lower dollar and temporary
payment difficulties by clients.
    Incoming orders in 1986 rose to 3.05 billion marks from
2.58 billion the year before, comprising domestic 1.30 billion
marks versus 1.41 billion and foreign 1.75 billion marks versus
1.18 billion.
    Foreign incoming orders rose despite economic difficulties
in developing countries and OPEC nations hit by lower oil
prices, Bilfinger und Berger said.
    In 1986 it won new orders in the U.S., Pakistan, Nigeria
and Egypt.
    Orders on hand at end-1986 totalled 3.64 billion marks
against 3.32 billion at end-1985.

revolving underwriting facility (RUF), said Merrill Lynch
Capital Markets as arranger.
    Under terms of the facility, Leucadia may issue euro-notes
in maturities from one to six months, subject to a maximum of
183 days. The method of issuance will be the issuer-set margin
system under which Leucadia will determine the spread over the
London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR).
    Leucadia has already established a euro-commercial paper
program for which Merrill acts as dealer.
    The RUF may serve as medium term back-up to the commerical
paper program although the two may be used simultaneously,
Merrill said.
    In addition to issuing euro-notes, Leucdia may also draw
under the RUF by use of a so-called "swing line," which provides
same day availability of funds of up to 25 mln dlrs. Also, the
swing line provides for use of a "spot issuance procedure which
allows the company to borrow up to the full amount of the 50
mln dlrs on two days notice.

Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone will
step down only after his plan to overhaul Japan's tax system
gets parliamentary approval, one of his closest aides said
today.
    The aide, who declined to be identified, said at a private
meeting, "Nakasone's power in office does not necessarily
terminate at the end of his term in October. It depends on when
(the) seven tax reform bills get parliamentary approval."
    Nakasone vowed yesterday to press on with his plan despite
Sunday's unexpected Upper House by-election defeat of the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in a conservative
stronghold.
    The socialist winner, backed by other opposition parties,
had campaigned against a controversial five pct value added
sales tax, the main plank of the reform plans.
    The aide dismissed the possibility of any amendment of the
sales tax on the grounds the opposition parties were demanding
nothing but retraction of the tax.
    They have been refusing to discuss a draft budget for the
1987 fiscal year starting on April 1, which includes the tax
plans. They have been resorting to an on-off boycott of
parliament since February 4.
   "If I were Nakasone, I would close the current regular
parliamentary session on May 27 as scheduled, attend the Venice
summit of industrial democracies in June and open an
extraordinary session to discuss the tax plans," the aide said.
    Under law, a regular session can be extended only once
while an extraordinary session can be extended twice.The other
option would be to extend the current session, he said.
    "The opposition parties will surely present a no-confidence
motion against the Nakasone Cabinet at one stage or another."
    One scenario then will be to reject the motion opening up
the way for tax reform.
   "Another scenario is the resignation of the Nakasone Cabinet
en masse. A third scenario is a dissolution of the Lower House
for a snap general election," the aide said.
    That is only possible if the 200 opposition members resign
from the 512-seat Lower House, necessitating by-elections.
    The LDP now has 304 seats in the Lower House after its
landslide victory in general elections last July.
    There are five independents and three vacancies.
    "The LDP which will put up candidates will certainly inflate
their seats, but at the expense of fierce media criticism," the
aide said.
    He said he expected the proposed sales tax to have little
effect on local elections to be held on April 12 and 26.
    About 2,600 elections will be held in all but three of the
nation's 47 prefectures including 13 gubernatorial elections.
    "Candidates running in prefectural assemblies will all
oppose the sales tax irrespective of their party tickets.
    "Possible effects, if any, will be on gubernatorial
elections in Japan's northernmost island of Hokkaido and
Fukuoka in southern Japan," he said.
    The two posts are now held by opposition socialists.

NYNEX Corp will urge the U.S.
District Court to approve Justice Department recommendations
easing restrictions on offering new services by regional
telephone firms, chairman Delbert Staley said.
    "While NYNEX would have prefered the unqualified lifting of
all of the Modified Final Judgement restrictions, we intend to
urge Judge (Harold) Greene to act as quickly as possible to
approve the recommendations," Staley told a news conference.
    NYNEX will file its comments with the U.S. District Court
on Friday, he said.
    Staley referred to Justice Department recommendations to
Greene last month that restrictions on manufacturing,
information services and out-of-region, long-distance service
be eliminated.
    Referring to information services, Staley said, "That
certainly is one area we would quickly move into."
    Electronic mail, voice mail and videotext are some of the
services NYNEX could offer, he added.
    NYNEX disagreed with the department's recommendation to
retain restrictions on long-distance service within a local
service region, Staley said.
    The company would like to have the option of providing
long-distance service within and outside its region, he said.
    "Our entry in long-distance would further stimulate
competition," Staley said.
    "We believe it would put downward pressure on consumer
costs."

brief warning strikes today in support of the union's demands

    Smith said the company ended 1986 with a strong cash
position of about 639 mln dlrs as compared to 158 mln dlrs the

or significant dividend increase or a stock split," he said.

to seek advance clearance from the DOJ or the Federal Trade

would be exempt from the requirement if it instead had filed a

filing was thrown out by the DOT on Friday.

Shares of Du Pont Co rose today after

109-1/8, up 1-1/8.
    First Boston's analyst was not available for comment.
    Analyst Theodore Semegran of Shearson said he raised his
earnings estimates for the company to 7.25 dlrs a share in 1987
and eight dlrs a share in 1988. The company earned 6.35 dlrs a

    "Good domestic demand, higher operating earnings and a
strng export business, probably benefitting from a lower dollar
and effects of reduced imports in chemicals will continue to
aid Du Pont." He also noted that energy earnings in the first
quarter are better than expected because of the rise in crude
prices. Semegran expects first quarter earnings
of about 1.85 dlrs a share from 1.67 dlrs last year.
    He also expects the company to raise its annual dividend
about 20 to 30 cts a share, from its current dividend of 3.20

U.K. Interest rates look set to move
lower even after Monday's half-point cut in bank base rates to
10-1/2 pct, analysts said, citing as evidence the suspension of
a British National Savings issue yesterday.
    The Department of National Savings, effectively a Treasury
Department unit, yesterday suspended its 32nd issue, launched
in October and paying a high tax-free 8-3/4 pct on five-year
private investments between 25 and 5,000 stg. A spokesman said
the suspension was just a reaction to yields on national
savings bonds being way out of line with the rest of the
market.
    The move was followed by a surprise sell-out within minutes
today of a Bank of England one-billion stg tap issue, the
second such issue in as many weeks, analysts noted.
    They said the near-instant sale of the entire new gilts
issue, for which the Bank of England had required a high 40 pct
downpayment, was clear evidence that the market thought rates
had to drop sooner rather than later.
    The sale of the tranche of 8-3/4 pct treasury bonds due
1997 occurred in an active, bullish gilts market as downward
pressure on money market rates remained intact, with the
bellwether three-month interbank rate down 1/8 point at
10-9-7/8 pct.
     It coincided with another strong sterling rally which
pushed the pound to four-year highs against the dollar.
    "That government stock disappeared very quickly indeed," said
Stephen Lewis, head of economic research at stockbrokers
Phillips and Drew; "It is an indication that the market believes
rates are going to fall further ... At least by a half-point
immediately after the budget (on March 17), and some people
hope for more."
    Stockbrokers James Capel said in a comment the move by the
National Savings Department was "of considerable significance."
    It said, "the real message ... Is that the decks are being
quickly cleared so as to facilitate a speedy decision by the
building societies to cut their rates when the inevitable cut
in bank base rates to 10 pct materialises."
    Building societies have said a drop in bank base rates
would normally have to exceed half a point to give rise to a
reduction in mortgage lending rates.
    Lewis of Phillips and Drew said he too believed the
National Savings issue suspension may reflect new U.K. Treasury
policy to point building societies towards a mortgage rate cut.
    "National Savings has been competing too effectively with
the building societies of late. Building society income has
been depressed in recent months," he said.
    He and other analysts said Chancellor of the Exchequer
Nigel Lawson was keen to see mortgage rates fall to keep a lid
on U.K. Inflation.
    Underlying upward pressure on prices is stronger in Britain
than in most other Western economies with inflation seen rising
well above four pct this year and above five pct in 1988 after
last year's 3.7 pct.
    Emphasising the impact of mortgage rates on consumer
prices, Lewis said a one-point cut in building society rates
would reduce inflation in Britain by about 0.4 pct.
    But Lewis and others noted that building societies had been
complaining to the government about intense competition from
National Savings, which they argued reduced the scope for early
mortgage rate cuts.
    "The Chancellor need not be worried about losing some PSBR
funding from National Savings, but he must be taking the
building societies' criticism to heart. It looks like the
National Savings move reflects this," one senior dealer said.
    A Savings Department spokesman refused to comment on this
interpretation, saying the suspension of the issue was merely a
reaction to the recent fall in U.K. Interest rates, which had
pushed yields on national savings bonds way out of line with
the rest of the market.
    "We are not politically motivated ... Funding was just
becoming too expensive and we don't need all that money," he
told

The Farmers Home Administration, the
U.S. Agriculture Department's farm lending arm, could lose
about seven billion dlrs in outstanding principal on its
severely delinquent borrowers, or about one-fourth of its farm
loan portfolio, the General Accounting Office, GAO, said.
    In remarks prepared for delivery to the Senate Agriculture
Committee, Brian Crowley, senior associate director of GAO,
also said that a preliminary analysis of proposed changes in
FmHA's financial eligibility standards indicated as many as one
half of FmHA borrowers who received new loans from the agency
in 1986 would be ineligible under the proposed system.
    The agency has proposed evaluating applicants' credit using
a variety of financial ratios instead of relying solely on
cashflow ability.
    Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.)
slammed the proposed eligibility changes, telling FmHA
Administrator Vance Clark at a hearing that they would mark a
"dramatic shift" in the agency's purpose away from being farmers'
lender of last resort toward becoming a "big city bank."
    But Clark defended the new regulations, saying the agency
had a responsibility to administer its 70-billion dlr loan
portfolio in a "compassionate yet judicious manner."
    Crowley of GAO, Congress' investigative arm, said the
proposed credit scoring system attempted to ensure that FmHA
would make loans only to borrowers who had a reasonable change
of repaying their debt.

consideration would be part of the Justice Department's review

process.
   Chrysler has made a 1.3 billion dlr bid to buy AMC from its

    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,

to buy back his stock occurred "on several occasions during the
past year."
    The offers were made by several Caesars World

    The Caesars World official suggested various forms of
payment for Sosnoff's stake, including other securities of the

the proposed compensation.
    Also suggested was a deal involving "put" and "call" option

    The proposed deals would have also included a "standstill"

Lured by the weakening dollar and the
conviction that oil prices are poised for a rebound, European
energy companies are buying up cheap U.S. oil and gas reserves
to replenish their supplies, oil industry analysts said.
    They said owning oil reserves in a politically stable
United States is good insurance against future shortages.
However, the quick pace of foreign investment has heated up
competition among European firms, well-heeled U.S.
institutional investors and major oil companies to snare choice
domestic oil properties.
    Strevig and Associates, a Houston firm that tracks oil and
gas reserve sales, said growing interest among foreign buyers
had helped push reserve prices in recent months higher. All
buyers of U.S. reserves paid a median price of 6.45 dlrs a
barrel of oil during the fourth quarter of 1986 for
acquisitions, up from 5.33 dlrs in the third quarter and five
dlrs in the second quarter, according to the firm's research.
    "Foreign investors have been here nibbling a long time, but
we're seeing new names and smaller companies coming in," said
Arthur Smith, an oil property appraisal specialist and
president of John S. Herold Inc in Greenwich, Conn.
    "Europeans, especially, do not have much indigenous oil and
gas and realize the tide will eventually turn in favor of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries," he added.
    Smith and other oil industry analyst and economists believe
the trend in foreign investments will continue in 1987 because
of the fall in value of the U.S. dollar, the perception that
oil prices have hit bottom and the fact that it is cheaper to
buy new reserves than to explore for them.
    Plenty of properties are available on the market, thanks to
the need of many companies to raise cash for debt payments and
general restructuring throughout the oilpatch.
    In two of the biggest transactions of recent months,
French-owned Minatome Corp., a unit of <Total Compagnie
Francaise des Petroles>, spent more than 230 mln dlrs to
separately acquire oil assets of Texas International <TEICC>
and Lear Petroleum Partners <LPP>. A spokesman for Minatome
said the company is searching for additional acquisitions.
    A partnership of two Belgian-owned firms, <Petrofina S.A.>
and <Cometra Oil S.A.> paid 150 mln dlrs late last year to buy
virtually all the exploration assets of the Williams Cos <WMB>,
the Oklahoma pipeline firm.
    But Japanese investors prefer entering into joint ventures
with experienced U.S. companies to explore for new oil. Japan's
<Nippon Oil> is a partner of Texaco Inc's <TX> Texaco USA in a
100 mln dlrs U.S. drilling program, and has joined with
Dupont's <DD> Conoco Inc in a similar 135 dlrs mln deal.
    Most buyers said the pay-back period of a property, its
geographic location and the lifting cost of the crude oil are
more important factors in evaluating potential acquisitions
than relying on a simple price-per-barrel formula.
    Rich Hodges, a Houston-based land manager representing
International Oil and Gas Corp, a partnership of <Preussag
Corp> and <C. Deilmann Inc> of West Germany, said the firm had
earmarked at least 50 mln dlrs to spend on oil reserves in
Texas, Oklahoma or Louisiana in the coming months.
    But he called that a small amount compared to the amount
other investors have for acquisitions. PaineWebber's Geodyne
Energy Income Fund, for example, has said it plans to spend up
to 300 mln dlrs on oil and gas properties.
    "The competition is stiff, not only from other foreign
investors but from the brokerage houses and U.S. oil
companies," he said. "Our company is shopping around because we
feel it's substantially less risky than pure exploration. If
you're going to take the risk inherent in exploration, you need
prices higher than the current market," he added.
    In addition to the foreign investors and U.S. brokerage
houses, analysts said many of the major oil companies were also
competing for prime properties.
    Houston-based Shell Oil Co, a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group
<RD>, has been one of the most active companies in buying and
selling reserves, Smith said. Since 1982, Shell has acquired
two billion dlrs in new reserves, including 470 mln barrels of
oil equivalent at a net cost of 2.80 dlrs a barrel, he said.
    "Buying reserves is a good strategy for most of these
companies," Smith said. "Domestic production has dropped by one
mln barrels a day because of cutbacks in drilling and it may
drop by another one mln barrels a day in 1988."

El Paso Electric Co said it has
agreed to limit rate increases in its New Mexico service
territory to a maximum of nine pct over the next three years.
    Last year, about 18 pct of the utility's revenues came from
New Mexico, 70 pct from retail electricity sales in Texas and
12 pct from wholesale sales under federal regulation.
    In January the company filed a formal rate case with New
Mexico regulators seeking a 21.66 pct increase in its annual
rates there which would have been equal to about 13.9 mln dlrs
net of fuel savings.
    El Paso Electric said it reached a stipulated settlement on
its New Mexico rates with several parties, including the state
of the New Mexico Public Service Commission, which provides for
rate treatment of the utility's investment in the Palo Verde
Nuclear Generating Station located near Phoenix, Ariz.
    The company said commission hearings on the stipulated
settlement are expected to start next month. If it is approved,
the new rates could go into effect as early as this summer. El
Paso Electric's January rate case will remain before the
commission pending approval of the settlement.
    El Paso Electric said the agreement provides got continued
full inclusion in its rate base of the costs of Palo Verda Unit
one, maximum rate increases of three pct on a cents per
kilowatt hour basis in 1987, 1988 and 1989, and no further rate
increases until 1994.
    Once the agreement is approved, the utility would still
have to prove cost of service increases to support at least the
maximum increase each year, a spokesman explained.
    The company said it will attempt to settle the cost of
service issues in timed to allow the new rates to go into
effect this summer.
    El Paso Electric said the agreement allows recovery in its
New Mexico rates of lease payments in connection with the
utility's 1986 sale and leaseback of its investment in Palo
Verde Unit Two to the extent of the book value sold.
    The company said it agreed that none of its costs for Palo
Verde Unit Three will be included in its New Mexico rates.
    The utility said the agreement also resolves any issue
relating to the prudence of the planning, management and
construction of Palo Verde and settles any possible issue of
excess generating capacity through 1993.
    El Paso Electric said it does not expect to have excess
generating capacity.
    The agreement also provides that any portion of the cost of
service deferrals not recouped prior to December 31, 1994 will
not be recovered through New Mexico rates, the company said,
adding it expects to recoup all deferrals in full by that date.

House Speaker Jim Wright predicted
the House would vote by a substantial margin to block 40 mln
dlrs in aid to the Nicaraguan "contra" rebels until President
Reagan has accounted for previous assistance.
    Wright, a Texas Democrat, conceded Congress ultimately will
be unable to stop the money but said the House vote expected
later today will tell the White House its contra program -- one
of Reagan's pet projects -- is in trouble.
    "The adminstration must face reality and focus on other ways
to find peace," Wright said.
    The House is voting on legislation that would block for six
months 40 mln dlrs appropriated last year. The administration
has said it intends to start using the money next month to
provide arms and equipment to the rebels.
    "We expect to win by a substantial margin," Wright said.
    The legislation calls on Reagan to account for all previous
aid, including money diverted to the contras from the secret
U.S. arms sales to Iran. The scandal over the arms sales and
the diversion of profits to the contras has plunged the Reagan
administration into its deepest crisis.
    The legislation also demands an accounting of 27 mln dlr in
humanitarian aid appropriated by Congress in 1985 and all funds
given to the contras by foreign governments or private
individuals at the urging of the Reagan administration.

Chrysler Corp today sold 405 mln dlrs
of corporate bonds from its nearly 3.5 billion dlr pension fund
to Wall Street investment bankers, vice president and treasurer
Fred Zuckerman said.
    He said this was the first of two planned sales of
corporate issues from the fund's portfolio. Zuckerman said
Chrysler will sell slightly less than one billion dlrs of
corporates.
    "Phase two (the second sale) will be in a month or so," the
Chrysler executive said, adding that proceeds will be invested
exclusively in the equities market.
    Before today's sale of corporate bonds, those securities
had comprised roughly two thirds of the pension fund portfolio.
    "After the two sales, equities will amount to 50 pct or
more of the portfolio," Zuckerman said.
    "We believe that the equity market has much more upside
potential than the bond market," the executive said. "Interest
rates are not coming down and I would not bet a lot that they
will drop sharply."
    He added, "I personally think interest rates may decline by
50 basis points at the most this year."
    Zuckerman said the 405 mln dlr bond sale was composed of
139 separate issues.
    "Sixty pct were utilities, 20 pct were issued by foreign
governments or corporations, and 20 pct were financial
institutions," he detailed.
    The Chrysler treasurer said that the corporate paper had
typically an 18-year maturity. "The securities were long-term,
high-quality bonds, mostly rated AA-minus or A-plus," he said.
    Zuckerman said Chrysler sold the corporate bonds at about
1.6 pct above yesterday's closing prices for these issues.
"That showed our portfolio is desirable," he commented.
    Corporate bond traders noted that Chrysler's sale occurred
against the backdrop of a slightly weak secondary market.
    They said they believed that Chrysler was sold the
corporates at a large profit because the issues were bought by
the automaker for its portfolio when interest rates were much
higher.
    Chrysler's Zuckerman said his company sold the corporate
issues to four large Wall Street securities firms.
    He said that Morgan Stanley and Co Inc and Salomon Brothers
Inc bought most of the bonds. However, Zuckerman declined to
name the other two houses.
    Yesterday, Chrysler presented four investment bankers with
a list of bonds and asked them to submit bids by this morning.
    Zuckerman said that Morgan Stanley bought more corporate
bonds than any one of the other three houses.
    Wall Street sources said they believed First Boston Corp
and Merrill Lynch Capital Markets were also in on the bidding
for the corporate bonds. They believed these two firms were
awarded bonds by the carmaker as well.
    A spokesman for Morgan declined to comment and referred
inquiries to Chrysler. Officials at Salomon, First Boston and
Merrill Lynch were unavailable for immediate comment.

Tenneco Inc, a company that has long
been rumored to be a takeover candidate, rose sharply today
when speculation surfaced that investor T. Boone Pickens may be
targeting the company for an acquisition, traders and analysts
said.
    Tenneco spokesman Joseph Macrum said "we have no comment to
make whatsoever." Pickens was not available for comment.
    Traders noted that activity in the stock increased today
after a published report linked Pickens to Tenneco.
    Tenneco rose two points to 48-3/4.
    Paul Feretti, an analyst with New Orleans-based Howard,
Weil, Labouisse, Friedrichs, Inc, said he was not surprised at
market rumors that Tenneco might be the target of a takeover
attempt.
    "It's pure market speculation that Boone Pickens and his
group may be interested," Feretti said.
    "But Tenneco would be a challenge to run because of its
sheer size and diversity. Mr. Pickens is a man who likes a
challenge."
    Pickens, who made an unsuccessful attempt to take over
Dallas-based Diamond Shamrock Corp <DIA> last winter, has made
no secret of his plans to acquire additional natural gas
reserves in the belief that gas prices will stabilize sooner
than oil prices. Tenneco holds natural gas reserves estimated
in excess of 3.5 trillion cubic feet, analysts said.
    Feretti conservatively estimated Tenneco's breakup value at
58 dlrs a share and said the company generated a cash flow of
about 10 dlrs a share "which is probably very attractive to
Pickens." Other analysts, however, estimate a breakup value
well into the 60 dlr a share range.
    "I strongly doubt that there is going to be any hostile
takeover," Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc's Houston-based analyst
John Olson said, putting little credence in the rumors.
    "Tenneco is a gargantuan enterprise with seven billion dlrs
in long-term debt and preferred stock outstanding." He said the
buyer would also have to deal with "the intractable problems"
Tenneco faces with its farm equipment unit and energy
businesses.
    Analysts suggested that Tenneco could use a number of
defensive strategies to fend off an unwanted buyer, such as
spin off some of its non-energy businesses directly to
shareholders, buy back shares or create a limited partnership
out of its natural gas pipeline interests.
    An analyst who asked to remain unidentified, discouraged
the Pickens rumor. "Pickens has a plateful already with his
holdings in Burlington Northern and Amerada Hess," he said. "I
don't think he would be willing to take on Tenneco's problems
with Case (the farm equipment unit), which has been losing
about 180 mln dlrs annually and is worth less than a billion
dlrs on the market today."

Mines Ltd> said it agreed to sell 6.6 mln shares of a new class

mln dlrs, increasing Placer's stake in Equity to 74.5 pct from
68 pct.
    The transaction is subject to regulatory approval and a
vote by Equity minority shareholders at the April 23 annual
meeting, the company said.
    Proceeds from sale of the shares, priced at 5.625 dlrs
each, will be used to buy and deliver 4,985,000 ounces of
silver to Placer, Equity said.
    Equity Silver said the silver remains to be delivered under
its sale agreement with Placer, after delivery of its 750,000
ounce minimum commitment for 1987.
    Equity said it arranged to acquire 4,985,000 ounces of
silver at 7.40 dlrs an ounces, subject to selling the shares to
Placer.
    Purchase and delivery of the silver to Placer will result
in an after-tax gain of about 6.6 mln dlrs, Equity said.
    It also said the stock and silver transactions will create
a 37,059,000 dlr fund out of which dividends will be paid when
cash is available.
    The cash fund will enable Equity Silver to continue to pay
dividends on its preferred shares and increase the likelihood
that it may be able to pay dividends on its common shares, the
company said.
    It did not elaborate on what common share dividends might
be paid.
    The company normally pays quarterly preferred dividends
totalling 619,000 dlrs from retained earnings, Equity Silver
said.
    Equity Silver had retained earnings of 2,312,000 dlrs at
December 31, 1986.

The U.S. House of Representatives,
in a key procedural vote, today opposed a grant of 40 mln dlrs
to the Nicaraguan rebels until President Reagan accounts for
previous aid, including proceeds from U.S. Arms sales to Iran.
    The major test of House sentiment came several hours before
the chamber was to take a final vote on the assistance.
    However, the 227 to 198 vote on a procedural matter was
seen as a temporary defeat for Reagan, who has made aid to the
"contra" rebels one of his major foreign policy initiatives.
   Congressional leaders, including foes of contra aid, have
acknowledged that despite today's rebuff, which was expected,
it will be virtually impossible to prevent the 40 mln dlrs,
which was approved last year, from going through.
    Even if the Senate goes along with the House in postponing
the aid, Reagan will veto the legislation and Congress is not
expected to be able to override the veto.
    But House Speaker Jim Wright, a Texas Democrat, said
today's vote was important because it would "send a message" to
Reagan that his contra program was in trouble.

A group of state officials and a key
U.S. senator said a corporate merger wave was harming the
economy and blamed the Reagan administration for laxness in
enforcing the federal antitrust laws.
    Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, the Ohio Democrat who chairs the
Senate Judiciary Committee's Antitrust Subcommittee, also
cautioned the Department of Justice (DOJ) to comply with his
request for a listing of each case since 1980 in which
department officials had rejected a staff recommendation to
prosecute a suspected antitrust violation.
    Metzenbaum had asked for the data by Monday, but the DOJ
failed to meet the deadline and later hinted it might refuse to
comply.
    Acting Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust Charles
Rule defended the administration's record on antitrust
enforcement and told the panel at today's hearing that the
department was in the process of preparing a response to
Metzenbaum's request.
    "We have nothing to hide, but we have to be concerned about
our institutional interests," Rule said. He provided no
explanation of what those interests were.
    Metzenbaum said he had scheduled the hearings and requested
the data out of concern "that this administration has abandoned
the nation's historical commitment to effective antitrust
enforcement."
    "The green light is on," he said. "Merger mania is rampant
in this country...and it is not serving us well."
    Rule countered that the low inflation and interest rates
and the continuing economic expansion meant the
administration's policies were working well.
    He said simply looking at the number of challenges filed
against pending mergers was misleading because there was no
reason to believe that a fixed proportion of all mergers were
anticompetitive.
    "If you look at the individual cases rather than the
statistics, you will see that we are appropriately enforcing
the antitrust laws," Rule said.
    Metzenbaum's view, however, was bolstered by the National
Association of Attorneys General, a group of top state law
enforcement officials.
    "The federal assault on antitrust has been comprehensive,"
Robert Abrams, attorney general of New York and chairman of the
group's antitrust committee, told the panel.
    "The reduction in enforcement has been exacerbated by
federal attempts to prevent both state attorneys general and
private parties from enforcing the law in accordance with its
clear meaning and Supreme Court interpretations," Abrams said.
    The group has drafted its own merger guidelines to bring
uniformity to the attorney generals' efforts to enforce the
laws at the state level.

State Banking
Commissioner Robert Empie, ordered removed from office in an
alleged insider trading scheme, plans to fight the charges, an
aide said today.
    "There will be a hearing on the allegations," a spokeswoman
said, when Empie returns from a meeting outside the state.
    Governor Henry Bellmon yesterday issued an executive order
removing Empie from office "by reason of his incompetence,
malfeasance and neglect of duty."
    Bellmon said Empie held or controlled more than 50,000
shares of stock in United Oklahoma Bank, a firm whose assets he
regulated. He said the commisssioner used "information available
to him only by reason of his position as commissioner to
determine when to sell or attempt to sell shares of stock."
    The order gave Empie 20 days to request a hearing,
something his aide indicated he planned to do. In the meantime
he was suspended from office.
    "Empie intentionally misled the state of Oklahoma into
believing that he had removed hmself from any potential
conflict of interest by placing the ... shares in a so-called
blind trust beyond his control, when in fact Empie continued to
be infomred of the assets in the trust and the value of those
assest and remained in control of their disposition, as shown
by his transfer of the shares on or about December 23, 1985,"
Bellmon said.

Dart Group Corp <DARTA>, which wants
to acquire Supermarkets General Corp for 1.62 billion dlrs, is
not likely to give up without a fight if its target seeks
another buyer, arbitrageurs said.
    Speculation that Dart's offer of 41.75 dlrs per share could
be just the beginning of a bidding contest helped Supermarkets
shares gain one to 42-1/8  on 2.3 mln shares.
    One rumor had Federated Department Stores Inc <FDS> taking
a look at Supermarkets General. "Our policy is that we do not
comment on any rumors or speculation of this nature," a
Federated spokeswoman said.
    An arbitrageur noted that Dart, controlled by chairman
Herbert H. Haft and his son Robert, last year raised its
initial bid for Safeway Stores by approximately 10 pct when
Safeway resisted.
    However, that company was later sold to a buyout group that
topped the Hafts.
    If history repeats itself, the Hafts could raise their bid
to 46 dlrs if they are rebuffed by Supermarkets General, the
arbitrageur said. But another arbitrageur said the Hafts'
present bid seemed "quite fair." He said the offer amounts to
10 times after-tax-cash flow which is "probably fully priced."

Rockwell International Corp is raising
200 mln dlrs through an offering of notes due 1997 yielding
7.682 pct, said lead underwriter Daiwa Securities America Inc.
    An officer on Daiwa's corporate syndicate desk said he
believed this was Rockwell's first debt offering since 1984,
when the company tapped the Euromarkets.
    Daiwa, the U.S. unit of Daiwa Securities Co Ltd of Japan,
has become the first foreign bookrunner in the U.S. corporate
debt market this year. The firm is sustaining a trend that
first emerged in early 1986, investment bankers said.
    Daiwa headed a syndicate that won the Rockwell notes in
competitive bidding. Rockwell has a net interest charge of
7.722 pct for the issue, the Daiwa officer said.
    The Japanese firm bid the notes at 98.473 and set a coupon
of 7-1/2 pct and reoffering price of 98.75 to yield 46 basis
points more than comparable Treasury securities.
    Underwriters away from the syndicate said they believed the
46 basis point spread over Treasuries was aggressive. They said
a premium of 50 basis points or more would have been more
appropriate. "It looks like Daiwa submitted a kamikaze bid just
to get the business," said one competitor.
    However, the Daiwa officer defended his firm's pricing of
the deal.
    "Because Rockwell has not floated debt since 1984, the
company's note issue is a museum piece," he said.
    The officer said he believed the Rockwell paper would sell
quickly, mostly because the company is well known and has not
tapped the debt market in three years.
    "Investors are hungry for high-grade debt issued by
household names," agreed one corporate bond trader.
    Non-callable for seven years, the issue is rated Aa-2 by
Moody's and AA by Standard and Poor's.
    Daiwa became the second foreign firm to manage an offering
in the domestic debt market in September 1986 when it won in
competitive bidding 125 mln dlrs of 10-year first mortgage
bonds of General Telephone Co of California, a unit of GTE Corp
<GTE>.
    It followed the lead of UBS Securities Inc, the U.S. unit
of Union Bank of Switzerland. UBS won its first deal in June
1986 when it bid for, and won, 100 mln dlrs of Allied-Signal
Inc <ALD> debentures due 2016.
    UBS brought two negotiated deals to the marketplace after
that.
    UBS led in late June an offering of 100 mln dlrs of
five-year notes issued by Transamerica Financial Corp, a
subsidiary of Transamerica Corp <TA>. That following September
UBS priced as sole underwriter 100 mln dlrs of Borg-Warner Corp
<BOR> notes due 1991.
    In early December Nomura Securities International Inc
became the third, and so far last, foreign securities firm to
manage a U.S. offering. The U.S. unit of Nomura Securities Co
Ltd of Japan, acting as sole underwriter, won in competitive
bidding 250 mln dlrs of extendible notes of General Electric
Credit Corp, a subsidiary of General Electric Co <GE>.
    The Rockwell deal is Daiwa's second as lead underwriter.
    Last December, Daiwa and Nomura were named primary dealers
by the Federal Reserve, along with L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg,
Towbin Inc and Security Pacific National Bank.
    UBS, Nikko Securities Co International Inc and Yamaichi
International (America) Inc have also applied to the Fed for
primary dealership status.
    Primary dealers are considered an elite group of firms
because they are approved to purchase U.S. Treasury securities
directly from the Fed's agent, the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York, investment bankers explained.

    They will be replaced with Coca-Cola Co <KO> and Boeing Co

    The paper, which is published by Dow Jones and Co Inc <DJ>,

divisors used to calculate the industrial average and the
related 65 stock composite index to maintain the statistical
continuity of the indices. The new divisors will be published

    It explained that Owens-Illinois, which has been one of the
Dow 30 since 1959, is the object of a leveraged buyout. The
tender offer is set to expire March 16.
    The Journal said Inco is being dropped to substitute a
stock that will make the index more representative of the
market. Previously named International Nickel Co, Inco is one
of the original components of the index established in 1928.
    While the Owens-Illinois deletion was forced, the Inco
substitution is being made solely to improve the market-sector
weighting of the index, not because of any change in the
company, the paper stated. Such substitutions are made from
time to time, most recently with the addition of McDonald's

Corp said it formed a new business group to sell and support
telecommunications products.
    Called the Telecommunications Marketing and Service
organization, IBM said the group combines the U.S. direct
sales, service and support operations of its Rolm Corp unit
with the marketing support operations of its Information
Systems Group.
    IBM said the new group is responsible for direct sales,
installation and service of the Rolm product line as well as
other IBM telecommunications products.
    IBM acquired Rolm, a Santa Clara, Calif.-based maker of
telephone swichboards and other telecommunications equipment,
in 1984.
    Analysts in the past have criticized IBM for not moving
faster to integrate Rolm's telecommunications products with its
computer systems.
    But Edward E. Lucente, an IBM vice president and group
executive of the Information Systems Group, said in a
statement, "This is an important step toward providing a single
IBM marketing and service organization to increase our focus on
our customers' telecommunications products needs."
    IBM said Jack W. Blumenstein, a Rolm vice president and
head of its Business Communications Group, will take charge of
the new telecommunications organization, which will operate as
a unit within the Information Systems Group.
    Blumenstein was named an assistant group executive of the
Information Systems Group and he will report to Lucente, IBM
said.
    IBM said the new organization will oversee the technical
and marketing support of Rolm and IBM telecommunications
products but will not be responsible for sales and marketing of
IBM gear.
    IBM said Rolm will retain responsibility for the worldwide
manufacture and development of Rolm products. Rolm will also
continue to direct the sale of its products by Rolm
distributors in the United States and overseas.

Division will continue to direct the worldwide development and

<Franco Nevada Mining Corp Ltd> said

    One vertical drill hole intersected gold continuously from
1,100 feet to 1,730 feet averaging 0.30 ounces per ton, the

    Franco Nevada said it has a four pct royalty plus a five

May. However, some New York-based aluminium traders said they
believe the size of Alcoa's position has been exaggerated.
    The possibility that Alcoa may be long call options is one

Wall Street market analysts said two
changes in the components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average
were part of a shift away from smokestack industries that have
long dominated the 30-stock index.
    "It strengthens the Dow," said William LeFevre, analyst at
Advest Inc. He said Coca-Cola Co <KO>, one of the two
additions, "is a genuine consumer stock as opposed to a
smokestack." He applauded the decision to drop Inco Ltd <N>, "a
super stock at one time that hasn't done much lately."
    The editors of the Wall Street Journal also decided to add
Boeing Co <BA> and dropping Owens-Illinois Inc <OI>.
    Charles Jensen of MKI Securities said Inco was a "stodgy
number." But he noted that putting two new stocks in an average
of 30 is a relatively minor change.
    "This will distinctly make the index more useful," said
Frank Korth of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. "The movement of
the market to the upside will be enhanced by the shift to
Coke."
    But he said Shearson's aerospace analyst today removed
Boeing from the firm's recommended list, taking it from a buy
to a hold. Korth said Boeing's business appeared to be leaning
too heavily to the military side as opposed to commercial.
    Prior to tomorrow's market opening the Wall Street Journal
will publish a new divisor to be used in calculating the index.
LeFevre said the divisor will probably go up a bit but will
probably be lower than its current level of 0.889 later in the
year due to forthcoming splits in components such as
International Paper Co <IP>.
    The divisor, which is adjusted whenver stocks are split,
dropped below one for the first time in May of last year. The
0.889 divisor means that a change of 1/8 (12.5 cts) in the
price of a component produces a change of about 14 cts in the
index.

Enrollment in the U.S. Agriculture
Department's fourth conservation signup is expected to be

higher than total enrollment for the first three signups.
    Enrollment will be in the range of seven to 12 mln acres,
USDA conservation specialists said. Total enrollment so far in
the 10-year conservation program is 8.9 mln acres.
    Producers submitted bids to enter 11 to 12 mln acres into
the program, Milton Hertz, administrator for USDA's
Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service said at a
congressional hearing yesterday. Not all the bids will be
accepted, Hertz said, but enrollment is expected to be high.
    As in the first three signups, the Great Plains area is
expected to attract the greatest enrollment.
    "The Great Plains area will be the predominate area which
we'll get signup in," a USDA conservation specialist said.
    Marginal corn acreage will likely be the bulk of the
acreage pulled from that area, he said.
    Fringe soybean acres in the southeast and some bean acreage
in the midwest are also expected to be taken out of production,
but the USDA source said this would be a relatively small
percent of the total.
    A special two dlr bonus to corn producers who enroll part
of their corn base acreage into the program has sparked more
interest in this latest signup, USDA officials said.
    Under the program, USDA pays farmers annual rents to take
land out of production for 10 years. The average rent payment
accepted in the first three signups was 43.50 dlrs per acre.

An overwhelming majority of Hughes Tool
Co shareholders approved a merger agreement with Baker
International Corp based on revised terms that allow the
companies additional time to sell a drilling bit business as
required by the U.S. Justice Department.
     Hughes chairman William Kistler said the revised terms of
the proposed consent decree also set a 10 mln dlr cap on how
much funding the newly combined companies will have to spend on
the disputed drilling bit business until it is sold.
    An earlier proposed consent decree did not establish a
funding limit.
    The Baker-Hughes merger, which would would create a 1.2
billion dlr oilfield services company, almost fell through
earlier this month when Hughes balked at terms of a proposed
Justice Department consent decree that would have given the
companies only three months to find a buyer for the Reed
business.
    Baker said today it would withdraw the one billion dlr
lawsuit it had filed to force Hughes to follow through with the
merger.
    Hughes' Kistler, speaking to reporters after 85 pct of
Hughes' shareholders approved the merger, said the revised
terms of the agreement give the companies six months to find a
buyer for the Reed drilling bit business. The previous
agreement had proposed a three-month period.
    Kistler said the the government had also indicated it would
consider granting, if necessary, an additional three-month
extension to complete the sale.
    He said there were "several people looking" at the domestic
drilling bit business.
    The companies, Kistler said, have also decided to
voluntarily sell a Reed plant in Singapore.
    Kistler estimated that the merger, which should be
completed in about two weeks, will result in annual cost
savings of about 50 mln dlrs. He said he expects "substantial
cutbacks" in the 20,000-member workforce at Baker-Hughes Inc,
the name the merged company will take.
    Kistler said the cost savings and greater efficiencies
should put the company on a profitable course. "We think that
in the third or fourth quarter after the merger we should see
something close to breakeven," he said.
    In the fourth quarter of 1986, Hughes earned 31.7 mln dlrs
on sales of 215.7 mln dlrs.
    Baker, in its first fiscal quarter ended December 31, lost
34.2 mln dlrs on revenues of 297.7 mln dlrs.

Inco Ltd said it did not expect its
earlier reported removal from the Dow Jones industrial index to
make a major impact on the company's stock.
    "We don't think that individuals or institutions buy our
shares because we were one of the Dow Jones industrials,"
spokesman Ken Cherney said in reply to a query.
    Inco closed 1-3/8 lower at 19-3/8 in second most active
trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
    Cherney, asked about the stock price slide, said: "I don't
think we can speculate. It appears to be a reaction but we have
no control over the content of the Dow Jones."
    The Wall Street Journal, which selects the index, said Inco
was dropped to make the index more representative of the
market. Inco, the non-Communist world's largest nickel
producer, was a member of the index since 1928.
    Cherney said Inco did not view the move as a blow to its
prestige.
    "I don't see any change in that area. We haven't used that
factor (Dow membership) as part of our promotional material,"
he said.
    Replacing Inco and Owens-Illinois Inc <OI> will be
Coca-Cola Co <KO> and Boeing Co <BA>, effective tomorrow.
    Nickel analyst Ilmar Martens at Walwyn Stodgell Cochran
Murray Ltd said Inco's removal from the index would likely
spark short-term selling pressure on the stock.
    "Some investors who have Inco may suddenly say, 'Well,
because it's not now a Dow stock, we should eliminate that
investment,' " said Martens, although he added the move was
unlikely to have a serious long-term impact on Inco stock.
    Inco has struggled in recent years against sharply lower
nickel prices. Its net earnings fell to 200,000 U.S. dlrs in

    Harper said the board has previously expressed a strong
determination to remain an independent publishing enterprise.
    Harper also said that New World Pictures, a shareholder,
has requested a copy of Harper's shareholder list to be used in

    New World has 30,800 shares of the total 4.4 mln shares.
    Harper and Row's stock closed off 3/4 to 33-1/2 after
rising 9-1/4 points yesterday.
    Shareholders are due to vote April 2 on a shareholders
rights plan designed to thwart hostile takeovers.
    Ivan Obolensky, an analyst with the investment banking for

remaining independent publishers with a "back list" of authors
stretching back 200 years.
    He said as long as the company maintains copyrights with
the estates of deceased authors, it controls all motion picture
and television rights to the stories. And he said new printing
technologies make new editions a profitable business.
    "Harcourt Brace needs a back list of that nature and is
willing to pay up for it," Obolensky said. But he said Harper
and Row "has plenty of beef to warrant a 50 dlr bid.

The Department of Transportation
(DOT) said it would go ahead at seven airports with a
controversial plan to reduce airline delays by enabling
competing companies to coordinate their schedules.
    Under the plan, the DOT will grant the airlines immunity
from the antitrust laws so they can redistribute their flight
times over the day and avoid the clustering of flights that
typically occurs at the most desirable travel times.
    Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole said she had
decided to grant unconditional immunity to the carriers serving
Atlanta's Hartsfield and Chicago's O'Hare airports.
    At five other airports--Dallas-Fort Worth, Boston, Denver,
Newark and Philadelphia--Dole said she would grant conditional
immunity to enable further government study.
    Under this part of the plan, the carriers serving these
five airports have been asked to give DOT their summer 1987
schedules by the end of the week.
    The agency will then review the schedules and decide by
Monday whether they threaten to cause delays.
    If so, those airports would be added to the list of those
granted wider immunity to enable scheduling talks.
    Dole said she was confident no anticompetitive effects
would result from the talks, which she said would be monitored
by U.S. officials and would be open to the public.
    Flight delays at the nation's 22 busiest airports soared in
1986 to 367,000 from 295,000 in 1985. The government believes
most delays are caused by weather.
    The DOT first proposed the immunity plan in late January
and said it might be granted for a total of 13 airports.
    Dropped from the final plan were the Minneapolis-St. Paul,
New York-LaGuardia, New York-J.F. Kennedy, San Francisco, St.
Louis and Washington-Dulles airports.

Inco Ltd said it did not expect its

make a major impact on the company's stock.
    "We don't think that individuals or institutions buy our
shares because we were one of the Dow Jones industrials,"
spokesman Ken Cherney said in reply to a query.
    Inco closed 1-3/8 lower at 19-3/8 in second most active

    The Wall Street Journal, which selects the index, said Inco
was dropped to make the index more representative of the

producer, was a member of the index since 1928.
    Replacing Inco and Owens-Illinois Inc will be Coca-Cola Co

    Nickel analyst Ilmar Martens at Walwyn Stodgell Cochran

spark short-term selling pressure on the stock.
    "Some investors who have Inco may suddenly say, 'well,
because it's not now a Dow stock, we should eliminate that
investment,'" said Martens, although he added the move was
unlikely to have a serious long-term impact on Inco stock.

In a discovery that could complicate the
search for an AIDS vaccine, a team of U.S. Army doctors said
they have uncovered a potentially-fatal interaction between the
AIDS virus and a virus used to protect against smallpox.
     Physicians at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research
said a 19-year-old man, who apparently had been exposed to the
AIDS virus, developed a pox-like disease and died after
receiving the smallpox vaccine. The military now tests recruits
for AIDS before vaccinating them.
    The findings, reported in The New England Journal of
Medicine, are significant because scientists have begun working
on an AIDS vaccine that relies on the smallpox vaccine.
     "Our case report raises provocative questions concerning
the ultimate safety of such vaccines," said the group led by
Dr. Robert Redfield.
     The report also throws into question the belief held by
some scientists that the smallpox vaccine, which exposes people
to a milder, protective form of the disease known as cowpox,
could be further modified to protect people against a host of
other diseases.

Doctors at the Centers for Disease
Control in Atlanta said they have new evidence that birth
control pills can help provide long-term protection from cancer
of the ovary, even if the pills are only taken for a few
months.
     The study, reported in the New England Journal of
Medicine, also found that all the various types of oral
contraceptives on the market were equally effective in lowering
the rate of ovarian cancer.
     The researchers estimated that the use of birth control
pills in this country probably prevented about 1,700 cases of
ovarian cancer in 1982.
    As more and more women who have taken oral contraceptives
"move into the age groups that are at highest risk for
epithelial ovarian cancer we may witness a declining incidence
of this serious disease," they said.
     Specifically, the team led by Dr. Howard Ory found that
"oral contraceptive use, even for a few months, reduces the
risk of epithelial ovarian cancer by 40 percent for women 20 to
54 years of age.
     "The effect probably takes from five to ten years to
become apparent, but it persists long after the use of oral
contraceptives ends. Moreover, protection exists regardless of
the formulation of oral contraceptive used," they said.

U.S. economic data this week could be
the key in determining whether U.S. interest rate futures break
out of a 3-1/2 month trading range, financial analysts said.
    Although market expectations are for February U.S. retail
sales Thursday and industrial production Friday to show healthy
gains, figures within or slightly below expectations would be
positive for the market, the analysts said.
    "You have to be impressed with the resiliency of bonds
right now," said Smith Barney Harris Upham analyst Craig
Sloane.
    Treasury bond futures came under pressure today which
traders linked to a persistently firm federal funds rate and a
rise in oil prices. However, when sufficient selling interest
to break below chart support in the June contract failed to
materialize, participants who had sold bond futures early
quickly covered short positions, they said.
    "Everyone is expecting strong numbers, and if they come in
as expected it won't be that bad for the market," Sloane said.
    Sloane said the consensus estimate for the non-auto sector
of retail sales is for a rise of 0.6 to 0.7 pct.
    Dean Witter analyst Karen Gibbs said a retail sales figure
below market forecasts would give a boost to debt futures, and
she put the range for the non-auto sector of retail sales at up
0.8 to 1.2 pct.
    Industrial production and the producer price index Friday
both are expected to show increases of about 0.5 pct, she
added.
    Retail sales "will tell us whether or not we will be able
to fill the gap," Gibbs said, referring to a chart gap in June
bonds between 100-26/32 and 101-3/32 created Friday. June bonds
closed at 100-4/32 today.
    Also key to debt futures direction, in addition to the
federal funds rate, is the direction of crude oil prices, said
Carroll McEntee and McGinley Futures analyst Brian Singer.
    "A higher fed funds rate and firm oil prices precluded the
market from breaking out of the trading range the last time the
market approached the top of the range," Singer said.
    In order for bonds to break above the top of the range,
which is just below 102 in the June contract, "the crude oil
rally needs to run its course and pull back a little bit,"
Singer said. "Fed funds are already easing back down toward the
six pct level."
    The recent surge in oil prices has also been a concern to
Manufacturers Hanover Futures analyst Jim Rozich, but the rally
may be nearing a top around 18.50 dlrs per barrel, he said.
    Rozich said he is looking for the June bond contract to
ease to 99-6/32 and find support.
    "I'm not quite ready to jump on the bullish bandwagon yet.
The jury is still out this week," Rozich said.

In a novel type of financing, Texas
Instruments Inc marketed a three-part, 225 mln dlr issue of
convertible money market preferred stock through Shearson
Lehman Brothers Inc as sole manager.
    Shearson, which originated the new convertible concept,
said each of the three tranches totaled 75 mln dlrs. In the
first, a 2.85 pct dividend was set on the stock with a strike
price of 190 dlrs that represented a 15 pct premium over the
common stock price when terms were set.
    Also included were 4.36 pct dividend preferred with a 220
dlr strike price and 33 pct premium and 4.49 pct dividend
preferred with a 235 dlr strike price and 42 pct premium.
    Texas Instruments common closed at 167.25 dlrs, up 2-1/8.
    Ronald Gallatin, managing director at Shearson, said that
"demand for the offering was unbelievable, especially for the
first tranche."
    He said that Shearson originated the concept of auction
money market preferred stock three years ago. The conversion
feature of this issue is the new wrinkle.
    Commenting on the first tranche, Gallatin noted that the
original pricing talk called for a dividend in the four to 4.20
pct area. This was gradually cut to 2.85 pct because of intense
demand, saving the issuer money in financing costs.
    The Shearson official said that virtually all buyers of the
first tranche received less than they wanted. He said the
latter two tranches were less strongly oversubscribed.
    Like non-convertible money market preferred stock, the new
version allows investors to redeem their holdings every seven
weeks. Investors then can maintain their holdings, sell them,
or offer to hold on to the securities if the auction
dividend is at least at a level they specify in advance.
    Gallatin said the securities were sold to a broad range of
investors, including major insurance companies, banks, money
managers and pension funds.

    For full-year 1986 ended October 31, the bank posted an

House trade lawmakers took their
first votes on measures designed to toughen U.S. trade laws but
held over until tomorrow the most difficult votes on
controversial plans to protect American industries.
    Meeting in closed session, the House Ways and Means Trade
Subcommittee failed to resolve one of the most sensitive issues
in the bill--whether they will force major foreign trading
partners to severely cut their trade surpluses with the United
States.
    The subcommittee is considering a toned-down version of
Democratic-sponsored trade legislation that aims to open
foreign markets but which drops last year's effort to force
President Reagan to retaliate with quotas or tariffs.
    Congressional aides who asked not to be identified said the
lawmakers intend to wrap up their proposals tomorrow and will
consider a proposal to mandate retaliation without setting
specific trade penalties.
    The legislation faces another hurdle in the full Ways and
Means Committee next week before the full House votes on it.
    Rep. Richard Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat who is seeking
his party's 1988 presidential nomination, said he may offer an
amendment to call for reductions in the trade surpluses of
those countries with barriers to imports of U.S. goods.
    This would be a moderated version of his earlier plan to
force a mandatory ten per cent annual cut in the trade surplus
with the United States by Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, West
Germany and other countries with the largest trade imbalances.
    "My criteria for a good amendment sets a standard for
getting the trade deficit down," he told reporters.
    The trade law changes are to become part of a major
congressional and administration effort to turn around the
record U.S. trade deficit of 169 billion dlrs last year by
opening up foreign markets and making U.S. products more
competitive.
    House Speaker James Wright, a Texas Democrat, said again
today he expects the full House will approve the trade bill by
May and that Reagan will accept the final congressional bill.
    "I expect whatever is reported (by the Ways and Means
Committee) will pass. We will have a good bill and an effective
bill," he told reporters.
    The comprehensive trade bill will include work by other
committees to ease export controls on high technology, to aid
U.S. workers displaced by foreign competition, to stimulate
research and development, to remove foreign trade barriers and
to improve education and worker training.
    The lawmakers agreed that for the first time a U.S.
industry could charge foreign producers with unfair competition
if they deny basic worker rights such as collective bargaining,
safety rules and payment of a minimum wage appropriate to the
country's economic development.
    They transferred to U.S. Trade Representative Clayton
Yeutter the powers now held by Reagan to decide whether to
retaliate against foreign violations of fair trade rules and
whether an injured industry deserves import relief.
    They agreed to make it easier for a company to get
temporary relief from import competition but agreed the
industry should provide a plan to become competitive.
    The administration has not announced its support but
Yeutter said yesterday, "I am cautiously optimistic," that the
Democratic-led House will come up with an acceptable bill.

American Motors Corp <AMO> management
has ordered a hiring freeze in view of Chrysler Corp's <C> 1.5
billion dlr takeover bid, a spokesman for AMC said.
    Analysts said the merger is virtually certain to go ahead.
    American Motors directors met for five hours Wednesday to

meeting periodically over the next several weeks on the
Chrysler proposal," AMC said in its first formal statement since
it acknowledged the Chrysler proposal on Monday.
    Chrysler, the number three U.S. Automaker, has said the
merger is motivated principally by its desire to acquire AMC's
profitable Jeep business and dealers, as well as a new modern
car assembly plant in Bramalea, Ontario.
    That means a guaranteed future for much of AMC, but it
leaves in question the fate of many of its 19,000-plus

Japan's corporate bankruptcies in
February fell 10.8 pct from January to 1,071 cases and total
debts dropped 49.4 pct to 149.40 billion yen, the Tokyo
Commerce and Industry Research Co said.
    February bankruptcies fell 14.9 pct from a year earlier,
the 26th straight monthly decline, and debts fell 54.3 pct.
    The lower number of bankruptcies in February reflected a
relaxation of money market conditions and reduced bill
settlements due to fewer operating days, it said.
    Bankruptcies caused by the strength of the yen against the
dollar totalled 69, or 6.4 pct of those in February, with debts
of 25.52 billion yen, the research firm said.
    This compared with 64 with debts of 125.59 billion yen in
January, it said.
    Currency-linked bankruptcies since November 1985, when the
dollar's depreciation against the yen began to affect Japanese
export-linked firms, totalled 772, with cumulative debts of
660.53 billion yen, it said.
    The value of the yen against the dollar rose to an average
153.49 yen per dollar in February from 184.62 a year earlier.
    Bankruptcies usually decline in the first quarter of the
year due to fewer operating days and for seasonal reasons.
    Bankruptcies are expected to increase in the quarter
starting April 1 due to expectations of slow consumer spending,
low wage increases for the 1987/88 fiscal year which starts in
April, and slow capital spending by manufacturers, the company
said.
    Bankrupcties among export-linked subcontractors will rise
due to a recent shift by major manufacturers to overseas
production, it added.

The Bank of England does not favour the
introduction of rules to shield companies from hostile takeover
attempts, its governor, Robin Leigh-Pemberton, said.
    Instead, merchant banks advising bidding companies must
show restraint and responsibility to avoid the excesses that
have marred recent takeovers, he told the Yorkshire and
Humberside Regional Confederation of British Industries' annual
dinner.
    Leigh-Pemberton also called on companies to improve ties
with institutional investors, suggesting representatives of
those institutions be granted seats on the boards of directors
of companies they invest in.
    "Boards cannot expect protection from unwelcome predators,
for that is but a short step from saying that they should be
protected from their own shareholders -- who are, after all,
the proprietors of the company," Leigh-Pemberton said.
    He added takeovers and mergers had an important role to
play in furthering economies of scale, integration and more
efficient market penetration. "The degree of success or failure
(of a takeover) has not in my experience depended on whether or
not the takeover was contested," he said.
    Leigh-Pemberton noted there had been excesses in takeover
activity in the recent past. "The aim is to pressurise a
company's management into action dedicated solely to a
favourable impact on the share price in the short-term, partly
or even primarily at the expense of the future," he said.
    Such bids "often depend for their success on creating a
highly-charged and artificial situation in the share market,
and give rise to temptations, on both sides of the battle, to
engage in aggressive, even manipulative tactics that are
immensely damaging to the interest of the shareholders," he
said.
    In a clear reference recent events, he said "those in the
City who act for companies or individuals .. Must, I suggest,
be ready to accept a full measure of responsibility -- even if
it entails opprobrium -- for the transactions that may result."
    They "should exercise the most careful judgment at the
outset with respect to the clients for whom they act and the
activities contenplated. Those who sow wind cannot expect the
whirlwind to visit elsewhere," he added.

The Tokyo Stock Exchange said in a
statement it is considering reducing brokerage fees on yen
convertible bonds.
    The cut would be in response to a planned increase in
securities transaction tax to 26 yen per 10,000 yen from 4.5 as
part of the government's proposed tax reform bills, securities
house managers said.
    Under the current system, investors must also pay 0.6 pct
of face value as brokerage fee to securities houses for
transactions involving principal over 30 mln yen.
    The exchange's draft revision sets brokerage fee percentage
rates in inverse proportion to the size of amounts transacted,
market sources said.
    Details of rates on transactions under 30 mln yen have yet
to be worked out, an exchange spokesman said.
    The news had little immediate impact on the convertible
bond market because participants are unsure when the new rates
will be introduced and because the timing of parliamentary

The overseas production in yen terms of
Japanese firms should rise 26 pct in 1987/88 ending March after
a four pct fall in 1986/87, a Ministry of International Trade
and Industry survey said.
    It attributed the rise to companies moving production
overseas to avoid losses due to the strong yen. The survey
covered 122 major firms in 17 sectors.
    The survey called for bold moves to stimulate domestic
demand to achieve the government's goal of 3.5 pct gross
national product growth in 1987/88. A package of economic
measures to boost the economy is expected next month.
    The survey said Japanese car output in the United States
and Canada would jump to two mln vehicles in fiscal 1990 from
617,000 in 1986 and worldwide electronic appliance output would
rise 31.7 pct. Domestic unemployment is likely to reach four
pct, or about 2.5 mln jobless, in fiscal 1990 from three pct
now if current trends continue.
    Recruitment in the car industry is expected to fall by 35
pct in 1987/88 and by 40 pct in the electronics sector.

Japanese corporate earnings will rise 8.9
pct in fiscal 1987/88 for the first year-on-year increase in
three years, partly because of the yen's stable exchange rate,
the Nomura research institute said.
    Sales of all industries are predicted to rise 1.9 pct in
the year, which starts April 1, the research arm of Nomura
Securities Co said in a statement.
    Recurrent profits were estimated to fall 20 pct in the
current fiscal year with sales forecast to drop 14 pct.
    The forecast assumes an average rate of 148.5 yen to the
dollar in 1987/88, compared with 160 yen in the current year.
    Corporate efforts to cope with the yen's appreciation, such
as cutting production costs, are expected to bear fruit next
fiscal year, the institute said. The economy should also
benefit from pump-priming expected from the government and a
halt in rising prices of manufactured goods, it said.
    Recurrent profits of manufacturing industries are projected
to rise 29.6 pct next fiscal year against an estimated 40.1 pct
fall in the current year.
    Non-manufacturing sector profits will decline 4.5 pct in
1987/88 against an estimated 2.2 pct rise in the current year,

The French 1986 current account balance
of payments surplus has been revised slightly upwards to 25.8
billion francs from the 25.4 billion franc figure announced
last month, the Finance Ministry said.
    This compares with a 1.5 billion deficit in 1985, and while
it is the first surplus since 1979, is substantially lower than
the 50 billion surplus forecast by the previous socialist
government before they lost office in March last year.
    Net long-term capital outflows rose sharply to 70.5 billion
francs last year from 8.8 billion in 1985, largely due to a

Rowntree Mackintosh Plc <RWNT.L>
announced it made a pretax profit of 84 mln stg in the 53 weeks
ending January 3, 1987, compared with 79.3 mln stg in the
previous year.
    Turnover was up to 1.29 billion stg from 1.2 billion. A
final dividend of 9.2p was proposed, after a final 8.2p last
year. Earnings per share rose to 35p from 34.8p.
    The results were broadly in line with market expectations,
leaving shares at 499p in early trading, up one pence from
yesterday's close, but slightly off pre-announcement opening
levels.
    Profit on ordinary activities after tax was 66.2 mln stg,
up from the previous year's 60.7 mln.
    The U.K. Remained Rowntree's largest centre for trading
profits, accounting for 47.9 mln stg, up from 45.3 mln in 1985.
Profit from its second largest geographical area, North
America, slipped to 34.7 mln stg from 37.2 mln. North American
profits were affected by the fall of the value of the dollar.
    Operations in continental Europe made 7.8 mln stg in
trading profit, up from 3.4 mln, with 4.0 mln stg made in
Australasia, up from 2.3 mln, and 11.3 mln stg from the rest of
the world, against 13.1 mln in the previous year.
    Extraordinary items amounted to a 11.3 mln debit after a
16.5 mln debit previously. A company spokesman said this
represented additional provisions for the cost of
rationalisation plans announced in earlier years.
    Rowntree expects North American operations will this year,
ahead of company expectations, be of the same order as those
from the U.K. And the rest of Europe combined, the statement
said. A spokesman said no specific figures had been forecast.
    Acquisitions will continue to be sought worldwide,
including further moves in the speciality retailing business
which Rowntree first entered in 1983, the statement said.
    Rising profit from Europe this year was forecast by
chairman Kenneth Dixon in a statement. He added the performance
of seven businesses bought last year was encouraging.
    The U.K. Confectionery side gained market share and
increased trading margins. The Sun-Pat British grocery concern
increased profit and Rowntree's small health food business,
Holgates, raised earnings 10-fold, the statement said.
    Offsetting factors included currency movements, which cost
the company nearly 5.0 mln stg. Sales tax hurt Canadian profits
on confectionery operations, and the company faced strong
competition in the U.K. Snack and Mid East export markets.

    In the leisure sector the group planned a joint development
with Club Mediterranee <CMI.PA>, Club Med, of a 200 hectare
pleasure park at Puisaye in the Yonne department of Eastern
Central France, he said.
    Wholly-owned subsidiary Lyonnaise de Developpement
Touristique would carry out the construction work and financial
planning of the development which would be leased to Club Med
as operator of the complex, he said.
    He gave no financial details but said leisure sector
investments would total about 100 mln francs over the next
three years.
    Investments in the communications industry would go mainly
to develop the group's cable television activities and its 25
pct owned Metropole Television affiliate. Metropole recently
won the concession to operate a sixth television channel in
France.
    Financing requirement of Metropole would be about 700 mln
francs over the next four years, of which Lyonaise des Eaux
would provide about 175 mln, Monod said.
    Monod said Metropole aimed to win a 15 to 20 pct audience
share and to capture about 10 pct of the national television
advertising market.
    Total investment by the group in the communications sector,
including cable activities, would be between 300 mln and 400
mln francs over the next five years, mainly concentrated in the
coming year.
    Investment in cable operations would total between 150 mln
and 200 mln over the five years, with the aim of widening the
audience to 280,000 subscribers from 12,000, and boosting
turnover to around 450 mln francs a year from 10 mln.

IBM Deutschland GmbH <IBM.F>, the
West German subsidiary of International Business Machines Corp
<IBM.N>, said its turnover fell nine pct to 12.0 billion marks
in 1986 as a result of currency factors, weaker demand in the
second half and stiff price competition.
    IBM Deutschland planned to strengthen its software and
service activities in future to ensure growth remained at
desired levels in the medium term, managing board chairman
Hans-Olaf Henkel said. He gave no 1986 profit figures.
    Domestic turnover fell 12.7 pct to 7.2 billion marks while
exports declined 3.2 pct to 4.8 billion.
    Most of IBM Deutschland's exports go to IBM companies in
other countries.
    Henkel said volume sales had been positive overall,
especially in the large computer and personal computer sectors.
However, at the same time, fierce international competition,
worldwide overcapacity and currency movements had reduced large
computer prices for IBM Deutschland by some 23 pct.
    In January Henkel said the annual growth rate of the German
computer market may in the long term be less than 10 pct, well
below the 20 pct expansion originally forecast.

Japan is ready to discuss bank

agreed, Japanese vice-minister of finance for international

    He told a Nikkei conference on Tokyo financial markets that
Japan viewed a January outline agreement between the Bank of
England and U.S. Regulatory authorities as "significant."
    The accord, setting joint rules on capital adequacy, was
criticised in financial markets for excluding Japan, thus
putting U.S. And U.K. Banks at a disadvantage to Japanese banks
    "I am pleased to say that we are prepared to work with
British and American regulators," Gyohten said.

every month.

The net position of federal states
worsened in the first March week, cutting public authority net
holdings at the Bundesbank by 500 mln marks, the central bank
said.
    States' cash deposits at the central bank fell to 800 mln
and they also drew down 1.2 billion marks in book credit, 900
mln marks more than in the prior week.
    By contrast, however, the federal government was able to
reduce its credit drawdown at the central bank by 900 mln marks
to 900 mln.
    Despite the stronger states' net needs in the week, their
cash position and other market dependent influences just about
balanced the outflow of liquidity from the money market through
an increase in cash in circulation, the Bundesbank said.
    Cash in circulation rose by 1.4 billion marks in the week
to 122.9 billion.
    Liquidity also came in through the maturing of short-term
treasury bills bought from the Bundesbank in the prior week.
    Gross currency reserves rose in the week by 400 mln marks

largely unchanged at 22.8 billion marks, giving a rise in net
currency reserves of 400 mln to 87.0 billion, it said.

The Bank of England does not favour the
introduction of rules to shield companies from hostile takeover
attempts, its governor, Robin Leigh-Pemberton, said.
    Instead, merchant banks advising bidding companies must
show restraint and responsibility to avoid the excesses that
have marred recent takeovers, he told the Yorkshire and
Humberside Regional Confederation of British Industries' annual
dinner.
    Leigh-Pemberton also called on companies to improve ties
with institutional investors, suggesting representatives of
those institutions be granted seats on the boards of directors
of companies they invest in.
    "Boards cannot expect protection from unwelcome predators,
for that is but a short step from saying that they should be
protected from their own shareholders -- who are, after all,
the proprietors of the company," Leigh-Pemberton said.
    He added takeovers and mergers had an important role to
play in furthering economies of scale, integration and more
efficient market penetration. "The degree of success or failure
(of a takeover) has not in my experience depended on whether or
not the takeover was contested," he said.
    Leigh-Pemberton noted there had been excesses in takeover
activity in the recent past. "The aim is to pressurise a
company's management into action dedicated solely to a
favourable impact on the share price in the short-term, partly
or even primarily at the expense of the future," he said.
    Such bids "often depend for their success on creating a
highly-charged and artificial situation in the share market,
and give rise to temptations, on both sides of the battle, to
engage in aggressive, even manipulative tactics that are
immensely damaging to the interest of the shareholders," he
said.
    In a clear reference recent events, he said "those in the
City who act for companies or individuals .. Must, I suggest,
be ready to accept a full measure of responsibility -- even if
it entails opprobrium -- for the transactions that may result."
    They "should exercise the most careful judgment at the
outset with respect to the clients for whom they act and the
activities contenplated. Those who sow wind cannot expect the
whirlwind to visit elsewhere," he added.

French stockbrokers will lose their
jealously guarded 180-year-old monopoly of share trading over
the next five years under reforms announced on Tuesday by
Finance Minister Edouard Balladur.
    But with the prospect of fresh money flooding into their
seriously under-capitalised share trading business, there were
few signs of regret over the gradual passing of an era.
    "It is a question of survival after London's Big Bang," said
private market analyst Edouard Cointreau.
    Balladur said the long-expected reform of the Bourse
structure will progressively allow domestic and foreign banks
to buy stakes in stockbrokers' capital, while at the same time
brokers will be allowed access to the money markets.
    The project foresees free access to the Bourse by January
1, 1992, the date set for the opening of a unified European
financial market.
    The planned reform, expected to be put before Parliament
before the end of the Spring session, will open up the capital
of the 45 Paris and 15 regional stockbroker houses in three
stages beginning on January 1 next year.
    The aim of the move, following the examples of Tokyo and
London in opening up their tightly-controlled membership, was
"to take up the challenge of European financial integration and
fierce international competition," Balladur announced.
    Cointreau, founder and chairman of the private market
analysis company Centre d'Observation et de Prospective
Sociales (COPS), said the reform was a natural development.
    "The Paris market is rising but that cannot go on for ever.

Southwest Realty Ltd said it believes it
could make all of its scheduled montly debt service payments
for 1987 despite the falloff in its rental operations, but
making the payments would probably severely impair its
liquidity and restrict its ability to maintain the quality of
its properties.
    The company today reported a 1986 loss of 1,544,000 dlrs
compared with a 1985 profit of 3,912,000 dlrs.
    Southwest said in addition to its monthly scheduyled debt
service payments, a 1,743,000 dlr loan on one of its Houston
properties is due to mature on April One.
    Southwest said a commitment to reduce the interest rate and
extend the Houston loan for one year has been accepted.
    It said talks are underway with lenders on other Houston
properties to obtain partial debt service moratoriums which, if
granted, would cut 1987 cash deficits from 1986 levels.  The
loan renegotiations could involve bankruptcy or other
litigation connected with the specific properties involved and
could involve the suspension of interest and principal payments
to some of the lenders.  Southwest said if the attempts to
restructure debt do not succeed, it could lose one or more of
the properties.
    Southwest said the Houston properties made up about 10 pct
of its current value equity as of December 31 of 14.20 dlrs per
share, down from 16.68 dlrs a year before.
    The company said depending on the success of the talks and
operating results for 1987, one or two more properties could
become subject to similar negotiations.  The two additional
properties comprised about 11 pct of its current value equity
at year-end, Southwest said.

    Excluding autos, retail sales in February were up 1.5 pct

27.7 pct from December levels to 23.52 billion dlrs, more than

The Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, CFTC, should increase speculative position limits
on agricultural futures and do away with them for financial
futures, Chicago Board of Trade, CBT, chairman Karsten Mahlmann
said.
    Reporting to the CFTC Financial Products Advisory Committee
on the conclusions so far of an ad hoc CBT committee on
off-exchange trading issues, Mahlmann said, "We came to the
conclusion that no meaningful purpose is served by speculative
position limits."
    Position limits were supposed to prevent market
manipulation, but "I would submit that the Exchange and the
CFTC currently have all the tools necessary to prevent market
manipulation, whether an account is speculative or a hedge,"
the CBT chairman said.
    Malmann said the issue was of particular concern to the CBT
because the exchange faced increasing competition from foreign
markets, most of which did not have position limits.
    He said the ad hoc committee, which he also chairs, had
agreed to propose that the definition of hedging be expanded to
include risk management as well as risk reduction.
    Mahlmann said there was a danger that if a category of
trading was given a name such as "non-speculative hedging,"
insurance companies and pension funds might be held back from
engaging in it by the regulatory bodies that govern such
entities.
    The ad hoc committee proposed the establishment of
"prudence guidelines" and a list of market activities that fell
within those lines which might be lengthened in the future, he
said.
    The committee might also propose that CBT itself be allowed
to enforce position limits on agricultural futures, he added.

U.K. Retailers expect consumer spending
to accelerate in March after a disappointing increase in
February, according to a monthly survey by the Confederation of
British Industry (CBI).
    Fifty-nine pct of the 325 retailers questioned for the
latest Distributive Trades Survey expected sales to be higher
in March than they were in March 1986, with only six pct
expecting lower sales.
    The chairman of the Distributive Trades Survey Panel, Nigel
Whittaker, said a favourable Budget next week would further
help sales during the summer.
    Figures released earlier this week showed retail sales in
January fell 2.2 pct, mainly due to exceptionally cold weather.
    "Sales did not recover in February as much as retailers had
expected, and they are now looking for better business in
March," today's survey said.
    It reported clothing stores were the most optimistic, with
80 pct expecting sales in March to be higher than a year ago.
    Wholesalers also expected stronger sales in March, while
both retailers and wholesalers reported slower growth in import
penetration, it said.

K Mart Corp said its record fiscal
1986 net earnings of 582.3 mln dlrs, a rise from 221.2 mln dlrs
a year ago, marked a "major turning point" for the world's
second biggest retailer.
    K Mart said the earnings rise for the fourth quarter ended
January 28 to 285 mln dlrs from 10.5 mln dlrs resulted from 
"merchandising, refurbishing and expense control."
    A year ago, K Mart took a charge of 239 mln dlrs for
discontinued operations. Earnings from continuing retail
operations in the quarter totalled 270 mln dlrs or 2.00 dlrs a
share compared with 249.4 mln dlrs or 1.91 dlrs a year ago.
    K Mart Chairman Bernard Fauber said "the success of these
programs is better illustrated by the strong 35.9 pct increase
in 1986 income from continuing operations before income taxes
to 1.03 billion dlrs, the first time K Mart Corp has reached
this milestone."
    Sales for the 1986 fiscal year reached a record 23.8
billion dlrs, an 8.1 pct rise from 22.04 billion dlrs the prior
year. K Mart said 1985 was restated to account for discontinued
operations. Comparable store sales rose 5.5 pct in 1986 over
1985, it said.
    Fauber said the sales growth came from greater consumer
acceptance of K Mart's apparel merchandise, "a marked increase
in hardline merchandise sales and a growing contribution from
specialty retailing operations."
    K Mart said its fourth quarter pre-tax income from
continuing operations was 493 mln dlrs, a 32.3 pct gain from
372.6 mln dlrs last year. It said sales in the period grew 8.8
pct to 7.23 billion dlrs from a restated 6.65 billion dlrs in
1985 with comparable store sales up 4.7 pct.
    K Mart said its effective tax rate rose in 1986 to 44.6 pct
from 37.6 pct in 1985. But it said selling, general and
administrative expense eased to 23.2 pct of sales from 23.7 pct
in 1985.
    "Our performance in 1986 marks a major turning point for K
Mart," Fauber said in a statement.
    "In the years immediately prior to 1986, we focused on
changing the look of our stores and the structure of the
company."
    K Mart, he said, committed billion of dollars for store
remodeling and installing a centralized point of sale system,
upgraded its merchandise mix, acquired three large specialty
retailers, divested underperforming businesses and restructured
its long-term debt.
    "We were forced to pay a temporary price in the form of
slower earnings growth and a lower rating by the investment
community. However, beginning with the fourth quarter of 1985,
our improved performance is proof that our approach is correct
for the long term," the K Mart chairman said.

British Telecommunications Plc's <BTY.L>
profit growth prospects for the coming years will be reduced by
increasing competition and continued costs for replacing old
telephone systems, deputy chairman Graeme Odgers said.
    Speaking at a news conference on the third quarter results
which were released earlier today, Odgers said the company
faced heavy costs for installing new digital telephone systems
in Britain for three to five years.
    He said <Mercury Communications Ltd>, a Cable and Wireless
Plc <CAWL.L> subsidiary, was becoming a significant competitor.
    Odgers said Mercury was seeking to make inroads into some
of British Telecom's most profitable areas.
    One company official privately estimated that British
Telecom still had a 99 pct share of the U.K. Telecommunications
market but feared that this could slip to 95 or 90 pct.
    The recent two-and-a-half-week engineering strike, which
lead to some disruption in service, could well have encouraged
clients to consider using the Mercury system, Odgers said.
    However, he forecast that the last quarter's results
overall should not be adversely affected by the walkout.
    He calculated salary savings as a result of the strike at
50 mln stg and while loss of income on telephone calls should
be limited revenue probably dropped on peripheral activities.
    But on balance Odgers said that group's financial strength,
economies of scale and the fact that it operates in a growth
industry will help produce annual profit increases for the
forseeable future.
    British Telecom will also seek to expand into
manufacturing, he said, adding that research and development
expenditure will rise both in terms of value and compared with
the current proportion of two pct of overall turnover.
    Analysts said the company's downbeat forecasts helped
shares dip to 242p in mid-afternoon, down 4p from yesterday's
close and off an early high of 248p.
    Philip Augar of stockbrokers Wood Mackenzie and Co Ltd said
the market expects slower profit growth, but forecast a seven
to eight pct rise in both earnings per share and pretax profit
over the next two years. In the 1985/86 financial year, pre-tax
profit rose to 1.81 billion stg from 1.48 billion.
    Augar noted that a government-imposed formula linking
charges to inflation meant that the company's scope for raising
prices was limited as long as inflation remains low.

U.S. retail sales rose sharply in
February but many economists said the underlying consumer
spending trend remains weak.
    February retail sales jumped 4.1 pct, more than the 2.5-3.0
pct rise the financial markets had anticipated. But January's
sales were revised down to a 7.4 pct drop, from a previously
reported 5.8 pct decline.
    "The trend is toward continued spending but certainly at a
much more sluggish pace," said Don Maude of Midland Montagu
Capital Markets Inc.
    Maude averaged out the wide swings in the retail sales data
over past four months to show that the pace of consumer
spending is slowing.
    Combining the latest data with a 0.6 pct drop in November
and a 4.6 pct gain in December, the average retail sales gain
over the four months was 0.2 pct, he said, compared to to a 0.4
pct rise for year-over-year sales through February.
    "You can see a pattern developing," Maude said. "I wouldn't
be surprised to see a fall-off in March, especially since sales
probably won't be boosted by auto sales as they were in
February."
    Despite the weak underlying trend, economists were
impressed by a robust 1.5 pct gain in total sales excluding
autos in February. This compared to a revised 0.4 pct decline
in January, previously reported as a 0.1 pct decline.
    "The increase in non-auto sales was broadbased, with gains
in durable goods as well as non-durables," noted Ward McCarthy
of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc. "It was a pretty healthy
report."
    He noted that building materials rose 1.8 pct in February
after falling 1.7 pct in January. General merchandise store
sales gained 1.4 pct after a 1.6 pct rise in January.
    "There are signs of life in the economy," McCarthy said.
"But it's jumping to conclusions to extrapolate this report
into the future." 
    A 0.7 pct increase in disposable personal income in January
which may be linked to the new tax laws probably helped boost
spending in February, he said.
    "A lot of people may be inadvertently under-withholding
taxes from their paychecks," he said. "When people in this
country get an increase in disposable income, the inclination
is to go out and spend it," he said.
    Economists said tomorrow's release of U.S. auto sales for
the first 10 days of March will be an important indicator of
how much this sector will add to first quarter spending.
     Auto sales accounted for the lion's share of total
February sales, rising 14.4 pct. This followed a 27.7 pct drop
in January, previously reported as a 22.4 pct fall, due largely
to the expiration of the sales tax deduction under new tax laws
January 1, the Commerce Department noted.
    Some economists argued that the because the gain in total
sales excluding autos also followed a decline in January, the
strength in the February report is less than impressive.
    "There is strength in the February data, but that's because
they were compared to low sales levels in January," said said
Beth Reiners of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. "We don't see it as a
precursor of continued strength."
    Durable goods sales rose 8.8 pct in February, after falling
17.7 pct in January. February non-durable goods sales gained
1.3 pct, after declining 0.2 pct in January.
    Gasoline service station sales rose two pct in February,
following a 1.9 pct gain in January, but economists said higher
oil prices rather than an increased volume of gas sales
probably accounted for these gains.
    Reiners also emphasized that the trend in consumer spending
is weakening. Total retail sales on average were 123 billion
dlrs in the fourth quarter of 1986, she said. In January, they
fell to a seasonally adjusted 117.52 bilion dlrs, and in

    "The number is not really that problematic for those of us

    Platt does not foresee potential for tighter monetary
policy on the basis of the latest retail sales report.

confusing," he said.
    "Before the 337,000 gain in February non-farm payroll

March," he said. "But now Fed officials will have to wait for
the first quarter real U.S. gross national product data in
April to sort things out."

Newmont Mining Corp <NEM> said Magma
Copper Co anticipates being able to produce copper at a profit
by 1991, assuming copper prices remain at their current levels.
    In an information statement distributed to Newmont
shareholders explaining the dividend of Magma shares declared
Tuesday, Newmont said Magma had a net loss of 46.6 mln dlrs in
1986, adding this was equal to 1.22 cts a share.
    Newmont holders will receive 80 pct of Magma's stock as a
dividend of one share for each of the 30,458,000 Newmont shares
now held. Newmont will retain 15 pct of the stock.
    The 1986 net loss was on a pro forma basis, Newmont said.
On a historical basis, it added, Magma had a 1986 net loss of
58.1 mln dlrs on a loss from operations of 42.3 mln dlrs.
    On Dec 31, 1986, Newmont said, Magma had about 85.0 mln
dlrs of net operating loss carryforwards expiring in 1999-2000
and about 4.0 mln dlrs of investment tax credit carryover
expiring in 2000-2001.
    Newmont said Magma has pre-tax losses of 290 mln dlrs
during the 1981 through 1985 period, noting the five major U.S.
primary copper producers reported aggregate pre-tax losses of
1.9 billion dlrs during five year period.
    Newmont said Magma had total sales of 347.3 mln dlrs last
year, including copper sales of 293.4 mln dlrs.
    It said the copper sales value was up from 267.6 mln dlrs
in 1985 reflecting a 10.1 pct increase in quantity sold to
212,000 short tons and a 0.4 pct decrease in price.

The Securities and Exchange
Commission removed a key regulatory obstacle to trading futures
on designated foreign debt securities on U.S. exchanges.
    The move would allow the Chicago Board of Trade, CBT, to
apply to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, CFTC, for
approval of a futures contract on yen bonds.
    The CBT has said it may apply for approval of the yen bond
futures contract, a CFTC spokesman said.
    The SEC's action, which was approved by a 4-0 vote,
specifically removes a regulation against trading futures on
designated foreign government debt securities on contract
markets that are not located in the country that issued those
securities.
    Futures on the government debt securities of Japan, Canada
and Great Britain can already be marketed in the United States
under a designated exemption issued by the SEC.
    But the new move would permit U.S. exchanges to apply to
the CFTC for approval of establishing futures contracts on
those securities, SEC officials said.
    The new SEC move would also allow those foreign government
debt securities to be marketed in the United States by
countries other than those that issued the securities, the
officials said.
    Since the foreign government securities underlying the
futures cannot be traded in the United States unless they are
registered with the SEC, settlement and delivery of the futures
would often take place in the foreign country, the SEC
officials said.
    The SEC is also considering expanding futures trading of
additional countries' government securities to be marketed and
traded in the United States, the officials said.

Uncertainty is growing about the prospects
for the economy as orders for industry fall and companies scale
back investment plans, the German Savings Banks and Giro
Association said.
    Exporters expect foreign demand to remain weak, while
industry is less optimistic than it was, the association said
in a report.
    However, last month's agreement among the six leading
western industrialized countries to keep currencies around
present levels was expected to be a stabilizing influence for
exporters, it added.
    The banking association said the possibility of using
monetary policy to stimulate the economy should not be
overestimated.
    Another small drop in already low interest rates could not
be expected to cause any significant rise in purchases of
consumer or capital goods, it said.
    The Bundesbank's half-point cuts in the discount and
Lombard rates in January have largely exhausted the scope for
any further monetary moves, the association added.
    On Tuesday the Federal Statistics Office said gross
national product stagnated in real, seasonally and calendar
adjusted terms in the fourth quarter of 1986 compared with the
third quarter.
    The Economics Ministry, commenting on the figures, said GNP
in the 1987 first quarter was also expected to be relatively
weak.
    Bank economists have forecast the economy will either
stagnate or contract slightly in the first quarter. Official
first-quarter figures are due in early June.

Cyacq Corp, an investor group
bidding for Cyclops Corp, said it would raise its outstanding
tender offer price for Cyclops common to 92.50 dlrs a share
from 80 dlrs, if certain conditions were met.
    The increased offer would exceed the 90.25 dlrs a share
price offered by Dixons Group PLC in a tender offer for Cyclops
that is part of a definitive agreement to acquire the
Pittsburgh-based maker of carbon tool and specialty steel
products.
    Cyacq includes Audio/Video Affiliates Inc and Citicorp
Capital Investors Ltd and other investors.
    Cyclops has about 4.1 mln shares outstanding.
    For the tender price to be raised, Cyclops must provide
Cyacq with all non-public information provided to Dixons Group
and Cyacq must be satisfied with financial projections made in
offering material by Dixons based on the information, Cyacq
said.
    Additionally, Dixon Group's rights to buy Cyclops common
and its rights to fees or expenses if the Dixon-Cyclop merger
agreement is broken must be rescinded, Cyacq said.
    Cyacq said financial projections it developed for Cyclops
were materially lower than the financial projections provided
by Cyclops to Dixons Group.
    A Cyclops spokeswoman said the company had no details of
the new Cyacq proposal and could not comment. "We have nothing
in hand," she said.
    In addition to making specialty metal products, Cyclops
also operates about 115 specialty stores that sell consumer
electronics products. The stores are located in 17 states
concentrated in the Northeast, Northwest and Southwest.
    Cyclops employs about 8,900 people in Pennsylvania, Ohio
and other states. It also has interests in non-residential
construction.
    In 1986, Cyclops earned 21.3 mln dlrs or 5.26 dlrs a share
on sales of 1.5 billion dlrs, compared to 1985 earnings of 26.2
mln dlrs or 6.20 dlrs on sales of 1.4 billion, the spokeswoman
said.
    The agreement with Dixons Group calls for Cyclops's steel
and construction businesses to be sold to a unit of Alleghany
Corp <Y> for about 110 mln dlrs once the merger is completed.
    A Cyacq spokesman said the new conditional tender price
would be all cash. He had no comment on whether Cyacq plans to
withdraw its current offer, which is scheduled to expire
midnight on March six.
    Dixon Group's offer extends to March 17.

Niagara Mohawk Power Co said the
existing ball-type main steam isolation valves installed at
Unit Two of the Nine Mile Nuclear Station will be replaced with
standard Y-pattern globe valves.
    This decision will delay start-up of the power plant for
about three to four months, resulting in a delay in commercial
operation of the plant to as late as the beginning of 1988, the
utility said. It previously had projected commercial operation
in September.
    The possibility of a delay to the first quarter 1988 was
raised by Rochester Gas and Electric Corp <RGS> last week.
    Niagara Mohawk said the delay will add to the plant's cost
at the rate of about 60 mln dlrs per month.
    A spokesman said this includes a total of about 10 mln dlrs
for removing the old valves and buying and installing the new
ones.
    The utility said the total anticipated cost of the plant is
now about six billion dlrs, up from the 5.87 billion dlrs
projected previously.
    This has increased the minimum overall disallowances under
the settlement Nine Mile Two's owners reached with New York
state regulators to over 2.1 billion dlrs, it added.
    Niagara Mohawk has a 41 pct interest in Nine Mile Two,
making its share of the disallowance about 1.1 billion dlrs
before income tax effects.
    Long Island Lighting Co <LIL> and New York State Electric
and Gas Corp <NGE> each have an 18 pct interest in the plant
while Rochester Gas owns 14 pct and Central Hudson Gas and
Electric Corp <CNH> has nine pct.
    The ball valves were manufactured by a Gulf and Western Inc
<GW> subsidiary which is now owned by Crosby Valve and Gauge
Co, a subsidiary of Gearhart Industries Inc <GOI>, the
spokesman said.
    The Niagara Mohawk spokesman said the Nine Mile Two owners
are looking into the possibility that the valve supplier might
have liability for the costs of the delays caused by the
valves.
    The utility said the replacement valves are manufactured by
Rockwell International Inc <ROK>.
    The company said it spent considerable time testing and
modifying the ball valves which, until recently, "demonstrated
potential for both improvement in performance and in ease of
maintenance."
    "Since activities to date have not yet proven to be
completely successful and because of timing and resulting
additional cost of achieving the leak tightness standard is
uncertain, we have no choice but to replace them," Niagara
Mohawk said of the ball valves.

rejected an Interior Department draft plan to open wilderness
lands in Northern Alaska to oil and gas exploration.
    The federation, the nation's largest conservation group,
said further study was needed to assess any possible damage
that development might have on the wildlife in the area, the
coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
    Jay Hair, the federation's executive vice president, called
the Interior's research into the effects of development "so
fundamentally flawed that it provides little or no basis on
which to make a public policy decision."
    Hair called the department's proposal a "reflection of a
largely political decision," adding "we have no confidence in
Interior to represent the broad public interest in this area."
    Interior wants to open the 1.5 million acre coastal plain
to oil and gas exploration, but it said only with tough 
safeguards to protect the area's caribou and musk-oxen.
    It said a preliminary survey showed the region could hold
billions of barrels of oil and gas, and that its potential as
an energy resource would never be known without exploration.
    Interior said oil on the coastal plain could match the 10
billion barrels found at Prudhoe Bay, just west of the plain.
    Under existing law, Congress must agree to oil and gas
exploration, and if it does not act, the land will remain a
wildlife refuge protected from commercial development.
    Hair said Interior's report failed to stress the
probability that finding recoverable oil is only 19 pct.
    He said Interior's study also failed to weigh oil, gas,
fish and wildlife information the State of Alaska had gathered
nor had the department consulted the Environmental Protection
Agency on the possible effects of exploration.
    The federation, in letters to Congressmen, proposed that a
nine-member commission be set up to study all aspects of the
issue and report back to Congress in about two years.
    Hair said the federation was not opposed to the possible
exploration of oil, only that Interior's study was inadquate to
make a sound judgement.
    Congressional observers said that at present there was
little sentiment in Congress to open the wildlife area for
commercial exploitation dispite increasing concern that the
United States is becoming overly dependent on foreign oil.

Eurobond prices in the floating rate

    "Today has been irrational, irresponsible -- possibly the

    Republic of Ireland FRNs were marked sharply down in
initial trading and market nerves soon infected other
supra-national and sovereign paper with dealers attributing the
falls to aggressive professional shorting by a few leading U.S.

    The FRN market has been suffering from acute contraction of
liquidity and consequent drain of investor confidence since the
effective collapse in the market for perpetual floating rate
issues late last year.
    Since then, FRN specialists noted that retail interest has
been sparse or completely absent and the stagnant market for
floating rate paper has become increasingly vulnerable to
manipulation, with nerves affecting all variety of borrowers.

Nord Est plans to make a convertible bond issue for a total of

    He told a news conference Nord-Est expected to receive
approval from the Bourse supervisory body COB in the next two
week, when terms would set according to market conditions.
    He said the issue was meant to boost capital ahead of new
investments.
    Rambaud said the company would pay a 1986 dividend of 5.25
francs, unchanged on 1985. Parent company net profit last year
rose to 99.5 mln francs against 71.1 mln in 1985.
    Provisional consolidated profits were lower at 185 mln
francs compared with 200 mln in 1985, of which 120 mln, against
147 mln, was attributable to the group. He said the lower
profit was mainly due to losses made by steel-tube maker
Vallourec, in which Nord Est has a 12.5 pct stake.

before provisions of around 135 mln francs.

A Purolator Courier Corp director
resigned from the company's board, saying he plans to take
steps to make or find an offer that tops the 265 mln dlr buyout
deal already accepted by Purolator's board, the company said.
    The director, Doresy Gardner, resigned in a March 10 letter
to the Purolator board, which was included in a filing made by
the company to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
    Gardner noted that the terms of the merger agreement in
which the company would bought out by a group of its managers
and E.F. Hutton LBO Inc bar directors from taking action to
solicit, initiate or encourage acquisition proposals.
    "I, as a shareholder, wish to solicit, initiate or
encourage such an offer or indication of interest, and believe,
therefore, that I should resign as a director of the
corporation," Gardner said in the letter.
    "Accordingly, I hereby resign as a director of Purolator
Courier Corp, effective immediately," he said.
    Gardner said he believes shareholders could get a better
deal than the buyout offer if the company would agree to be
sold to some other entity, or if it could sell off all or part
of its U.S. courier division.
    On March 4, another Purolator shareholder, Rodney Shields,
filed a class action suit on behalf of the company's
shareholders charging the company and its board with breaching
their fiduciary duty by failing to take steps to ensure that
shareholders got the highest possible price in the buyout.
    The deal would give shareholders 35 dlrs a share in cash if
just 83 pct of Purolator's 7.6 mln shares are tendered. If more
are tendered, they would receive 29 dlrs in cash and six dlrs
in debentures and a warrant to buy stock in the new company in
exchange for each share.

Newmont Mining Corp <NEM> said Magma
Copper Co's certificate of incorporation and by-laws have been
restated to limit the transferability of the company's stock.
    In an information statement on its decision to distribute
Magma stock as a dividend, Newmont said the changes "will
impede any change of control of Magma."
    It said this has been done by authorizing two closses of
common stock -- 60 mln class A shares with one vote each and
38.1 mln class B shares with four votes each. In the dividend
of one Magma share for each Newmont share outstanding announced
Tuesday, Class B shares are being distributed.
    Newmont is distributing 30,458,100 Magma shares, or 80 pct
of the Class B common, to its shareholders.
    It said this stock will be transferable as Class B stock
until one entity acquires over 10 pct of the shares.
    Any shares over 10 pct of those outstanding will
automatically be changed by the transfer agent to Class A
stock, Newmont said.
    The company said there are two exceptions under the bylaws
-- the 15 pct of Magma's stock it is retaining and the 21 pct
which will be held by <Consolidated Gold Fields PLC> as a
result of its ownership of that portion of Newmont.
    However, Newmont Secretary Roger Adams said, any additional
Magma shares acquired by Newmont or Consolidated will
automatically become Class A shares.
    None of the authorized Class A shares is being distributed
at this point, Newmont said.
    The company also said five pct of Magma's stock is being
held in trust for members of Magma's management.
    Newmont said Magma's restated certificate of incorporation
also limits change in control of the company by dividing the
board into three classes serving staggered terms.
    Newmont said the new Magma rules also provide that
shareholder action can be taken only at shareholder meetings,
prohibiting shareholder action by written consent, and include
"fair price" provisions limiting combinations with any holder
of more than 10 pct of Magma's voting power.

consider a marketing loan.

Volkswagen AG <VOWG.F> supervisory
board chairman Karl Gustaf Ratjen said entire data tapes had
been erased and complete programs altered in forged
transactions amounting to around 480 mln marks.
    "In this case a degree of criminal energy has been brought
into play which until now was unimaginable in a German company,"
he said in a radio interview.
    He could not completely rule out the possibility that
losses would exceed 500 mln marks, but said there were
currently no signs that they would be higher than the 480 mln
announced on Tuesday.
    Some 70 to 80 mln marks had probably been lost through
disregard for internal instructions, he added, but did not
elaborate. However, the remainder had definitely been lost
through criminal action and forgery in 1984.
    Ratjen said the affair would lead to consequences up to the
board room. He would recommend that those under suspicion of
being involved in criminal acts would have to go immediately.
    Those who had not exercised checking functions sufficiently
would also have to go.
    But Volkwagen management board chairman Carl Hahn was not
involved in the affair, he said.
    A Volkswagen spokesman said the company had made sufficient
provision in previous years to cover the losses from the fraud.
Its 1986 profit would, therefore, match 1985 world group net
profits of 595.6 mln marks.
    Volkwagen disclosed the existence of the fraud on Tuesday,
saying it was possible that documents about currency hedging
had been falsified and that those responsible may have come
from outside Volkswagen and may have been assisted by company
staff.
    Criminal complaints on suspicion of fraud, breach of trust
and forgery of documents had been filed, it added.
    The company spokesman said the supervisory board would meet
on April 9 to examine the precise extent of the losses and to
approve the year-end results.
    Ratjen said it was important for Volkwagen to maintain a
degree of "internal integrity" on account of its 200,000
employees, particularly as shop floor elections were coming up.
    "On the one hand one fights for every single mark of income.
And here is a case where hundreds of millions are being just
thrown away," he added.

The new British one ounce gold coin, the
"Britannia," will be priced on the basis of the gold price on the
day of purchase plus a "competitive premium," Treasury officials
said.
    Value added tax will be levied on all purchases by members
of the U.K. Public, as is currently the case with foreign
coins, although transactions between members of the London Gold
Market and all exports of the coins will be zero-rated. No
decision has yet been taken on the face value of the coins.
    Although a number of gold coins, especially the Canadian
Maple, have been issued elsewhere in an attempt to take the
place of the South African krugerrand, the British government
still feels that there is a gap in the market for a British one
ounce gold coin. The only British gold coin available at
present is the sovereign, which contains 0.2354 ounces of gold.
    Gold from South Africa or the Soviet Union will not be used
in the coin, officials said, adding that bullion would be
bought on the world gold market. But analysts said it would be
difficult to ascertain the origins of such purchases.
    No details are yet available on how many coins will be
issued or how much gold will be bought, but traders said that
the amounts involved would be unlikely to move the gold price.
    There were some enquiries on the "Britannia" from coin
dealers today, but value added tax would prove a major factor
in the success of the coin, with the 15 pct tax likely to put
off many investors, traders said.
    Some said that the "Britannia" had come too late, with the
Canadian Maple Leaf, the American Eagle and other gold coins
already well established.

A proposal the London Metal Exchange,
LME, change its new clearing system, due to start May 29, was
made today at a meeting of LME members and International
Commodities Clearing House, ICCH, representatives.
    Amalgamated Metal Trading Ltd, AMT, proposed that a daily
cash-cleared system common to all other markets should be
adopted, rather than the system currently planned whereby
prompt dates are settled when they mature.
    AMT claims the margin requirements for the latter will be
costly.
    Opposition to the proposal came mainly from trade and
industry representatives who, as traditional users of the
Exchange's hedging facilities, said a cash-cleared system would
be more costly for them.
    LME Board Chairman Jacques Lion said any major alterations
to the planned new clearing system would have to be referred to
the Securities and Investment Board, SIB, and this could be
time consuming, bearing in mind the May 29 start-up.
    There was also a risk of the Exchange losing its greatest
asset, its trade hedging business, he said.
    Lion accepted a proposal that, while clearing with the ICCH
continue as planned, details of AMT's cash clearing system be
circulated for consideration and discussion by LME Board,
Committee and members for possible introduction at a later
date.
    The LME also said that Japanese yen contracts will now be
excluded from clearing as they are not used widely enough to
warrant inclusion.

A member of the board which
regulates the Farm Credit System predicted the troubled farm
lender may lose about 900 mln dlrs in the first half of 1987,
hastening the need for a federal rescue this year.
    Speaking to the House subcommittee responsible for farm
credit issues, Farm Credit Administration (FCA) board member
Jim Billington said "My recommendation is that legislation
(aiding the system) must be moved prior to June, 30, 1987, or
it will be difficult to close the (farm credit system) books."
    Billington's loss prediction is gloomier than either the
system or its regulator had previously admitted.
    The system itself has so far predicted losses for all of
1987 will reach only 1.1 billion dlrs, down from 1.9 billion in
1986 and 2.7 billion in 1985.
    However, Billington said the system is losing in excess of
400 mln dlrs per quarter, implying total losses for 1987 of
more than 1.6 billion.
    Losses of that magnitude would exhaust the 1.4 billion dlrs
in capital surplus the system held at the end of 1986.
    The system also has 4.2 billion dlrs in capital held by its
member borrowers, called borrower stock, which theoretically
could be used as capital.
    Billington said by the end of 1987, more than 1.6 billion
dlrs of the 4.2 billion in borrower stock would be downgraded
in value because of the mounting losses.
    Chairman of the FCA board, Frank Naylor, urged that
Congress begin to consider legislation rescuing the system by
Easter and that a bill be completed by the fall.
    Chairman of the House subcommittee, Rep. Ed Jones,
(D-Tenn.) said today "the time has arrived to consider
assistance to save the system."
    The Senate Democratic leadership indicated last month that
it would begin drafting a bailout bill by Easter.
    FCA board members differed on whether a direct government
infusion of cash will be needed to rescue the system. FCA
chairman Naylor said a federal guarantee of both borrower stock
and system bonds held by investors might avoid the need to
provide "hard capital" to the system.
    However, Billington said "its not really that simple, in my
opinion," adding that government funds may be needed to rescue
the system.
    Neither regulator estimated how much money might be needed.

    Affirmed were the company's BBB-minus senior debt, BB-plus
subordinated debt and A-3 commercial paper.
    S and P pointed out that the fourth-quarter loss resulted
from the write-off of nearly 600 mln dlrs in assets, especially
in agricultural chemicals and natural resources.
    Because that write-off had no effect on Grace's cash, S and
P affirmed the current ratings, noting that Grace intends to
sell its agricultural business.
    Proceeds from the sale of the agricultural segment could be
used to reduce Grace's debt, Standard and Poor's said.
    However, S and P said it is less clear whether Grace can
also extricate itself from the project debt from its phosphate
mining joint venture at Four Corners.
    Despite today's rating affirmation, S and P cautioned that
Grace has greater-than-usual vulnerability to rating change in

MacMillan Bloedel
Ltd's share price rose 4-1/2 dlrs to 79-1/4 after climbing by
as much as 5-1/4 dlrs in trading earlier on the Toronto Stock
Exchange.
    Company officials were not immediately available to comment
on the steep gain.
    Forestry analyst Rick Sales at Vancouver, British
Columbia-based Odlum Brown Ltd said the strength partly
reflected the buoyant forest products industry, the company's
proposed three-for-one stock split and strong 1987 earnings
prospects.
    He predicted MacMillan Bloedel would earn eight dlrs a
share this year. The company's 1986 net profit after a 1.45 dlr
extraordinary gain rose to 4.66 dlrs a share from 54 cts a
share in 1985 due to lower costs and stronger markets.
    Sales added that investors might also be expecting "a major
dividend increase." The company paid 75 cts a share in regular
common stock dividends last year.
    MacMillan Bloedel's 49 pct-owner <Noranda Inc> "needs cash
and they do have people on (MacMillan's) board of directors,"
said Sales.
    Noranda said earlier this week it planned a public share
offer in its Noranda Forest Inc unit, which holds Noranda's
stake in MacMillan Bloedel.
    Sales discounted previous speculation that Noranda might
try to sell its stake in MacMillan.
    Noranda would rather probably like to raise its stake,
Sales said, although he added such a move could meet opposition
from the British Columbia government, which limited
Toronto-based Noranda to a minority stake in its 1981 takeover
bid for MacMillan Bloedel.

A former broker at PaineWebber Inc was
charged by a federal grand jury with involvement in a 700,000
dlr money-laundering scheme, according to indictment papers.
    Gary Eder, 41, a former vice-president at PaineWebber, was
charged with conspiracy and falsifying brokerage records in the
two-count indictment.
    According to the indictment, Eder produced more brokerage
commissions than any other broker at PaineWebber, and was its
most highly-paid broker between 1982-86.
    Eder is charged with conspiring with unnamed supervisors at
PaineWebber to prevent the filing of Currency Transaction
Reports with the Internal Revenue Service. Federal law requires
that reports be filed with the IRS for any single cash
transaction in one day of more than 10,000 dlrs.
    Asked about the charges, a Painewebber spokeswoman said the
company had not seen the indictment and had no comment. She
said Eder was suspended January 22 and resigned from the firm
on february 17.
    David Spears, the federal prosecutor in charge of the case,
said Eder received cash from individual customers in amounts
ranging up to 70,000 dlrs at a time but avoided filing reports
by depositing the cash into the customers' accounts in amounts
just under 10,000 dlrs on several different days.
    If convicted, Eder could receive a maximum jail term of ten
years and 260,000 dlrs in fines.

Purolator Courier corp's stock rose on

Implementation of a one-year 0/92
pilot program for wheat and feedgrains was strongly promoted
today by the chairman of a key house agriculture subcommittee
as a way to cut farm costs and simultaneously give farmers
another option when making their planting decisions.
    "We have a budget driven farm policy. It may be a shame,
but we are locked into this," said Dan Glickman, (D-Kans.),
chairman of the subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feed
grains. "We need to look at ways to cut costs and not hurt the
farmer. A 0/92 plan, if properly done, could do both."
    Glickman announced this week plans to introduce a 0/92 bill
for 1987 and 1988 wheat and feedgrains. An aide to Glickman
said that it will probably be introduced next week.
    Glickman said a 0/92 program, which allows a farmer to
forego planting and still receive 92 pct of his deficiency
payment, would not be a major revision of the 1985 farm bill --
only an extension of the 50/92 option already provided under
the current bill.
    It is premature to make any major changes in the farm bill,
he said, but if agriculture has to make further cuts to meet
budget goals, a voluntary 0/92 plan would be better than
sharply cutting target prices, as USDA has proposed.
    A 0/92 plan, however, would not be decoupling, but simply a
different type of acreage diversion program, Glickman said.
    Decoupling -- delinking planting decisions from government
payments -- is too much of a policy change to approve at this
point, he said.
    "I don't think there is any interest in pursuing a
decoupling bill this year. Period. Unequivocal," Glickman said
at the hearing.
    Sen. Rudy Boschwitz (R-Minn.), cosponsor of the
Boren/Boschwitz decoupling plan, said he supports a short term
0/92 program as a move to a more permament decoupling plan.
    Boschwitz plans to introduce a 0/92 plan in the senate. His
plan would guarantee a certain deficiency payment to
participating farmers, require that idled acreage be put to
conservation use only, prohibit haying and grazing on extra
idled acreage, limit participation to a certain number of acres
in a county and provide tenant protection provisions.
    "I know we cannot obtain complete decoupling in 1987, but
we can at least move in that direction," Boschwitz said.
    Robbin Johnson, vice president of Cargill, Inc., testified
in favor of decoupling. Decoupling would end the current bias
in U.S. farm policy towards overproduction and reduce farmers'
dependency on the government, he said.
    A 0/92 plan does not go far enough in decoupling, Johnson
said, and would still encourage farmers to plant.
    Officials from the National Corn Growers Association and
the National Cattlemen's Association said their groups oppose
any 0/92 or decoupling plan due to concerns about reopening the
farm bill and creating more confusion among farmers.
    But when asked if his association were forced to choose
between a ten pct cut in target prices or a 0/92 program, Larry
Johnson of the Corn Growers said they would agree to 0/92
rather than take sharp cuts in target levels.

Director of the Office of Management
and Budget James Miller said the Reagan administration had no
intention of raising taxes in order to reduce the federal
budget deficit.
     "There will be no tax increases," he said three times
before a Management Briefing luncheon of Southern Methodist
University's Edwin L. Cox School of Business.
     The budget deficit, which is currently slated at 173
billion dlrs for fiscal 1988, is supposed to be reduced to 108
billion dlrs under the provisions of the Gramm-Rudman Act,
which calls for a balanced budget by fiscal 1991.
     Miller said he believes the budget deficit can be reduced
but added, "the surest way to put us in a pickle" would be to
raise or ease the Gramm-Rudman goal.
     "If we were to raise taxes so soon after tax reform, it
would create enormous uncertainty on the financial markets," he
said, adding that giving up on the will to reduce the deficit
would also create uncertainty.
     Miller reiterated the president's budget proposal that the
deficit could be reduced by a total of 42 billion dlrs through
increased revenues and spending cuts. An additional 23 billion
dlrs from economic growth is expected to result in the budget
deficit being reduced to the 108 billion dlr target.
     Miller said it was possible the Administration might
support an oil import fee, but added that the President was
concerned that such a move might have more adverse results than
benefits.
     He also said the Administration was seeking to spin off
Amtrak, which costs the government about 500 mln dlrs a year,
but added that he did not expect it to be accomplished this
year.

A Federal Communications Commission
(FCC) board recommended raising the two-dollar monthly
subscriber line charge for residential telephone customers by
1.50 dlrs over the next two years.
    The subscriber line charge was first levied by the FCC in
June, 1985, in an effort to more acurately reflect the cost of
providing phone service as a part of phone deregulation.
    The recommendation by the board, composed of federal and
state utility regulators, was expected to be approved by the
FCC in a seperate decision in the next few weeks.
    The subscriber line charge for residences and businesses
with single phone lines will rise to 2.60 dlrs in June 1987,
3.20 in September 1988, and 3.50 dlrs in April 1989.
    The staff of the FCC said at a public meeting that the
increase in the charge would make possible a reduction in
long-distance phone rates of 15 pct or 17 billion dlrs over six
years.
    Supporters of the subscriber line charge have argued that
long distance phone rates had been subsidizing local phone
service, which would lead to abandonment of the phone network
by large commercial phone customers.

The Reagan Administration sent to
Congress proposed legislation that would require Congress to
reflect the cost of federal loan subsidies in the government's
budget.
    The legislation would require Congress to approve all
subsidies on loans, to sell off many loans to the private
sector shortly after they are made and to buy private
reinsurance for many guaranteed loans.
    White House officials estimated reinsurance premiums  could
amount to six billion dlrs a year to private companies.
    The bill would make little impact on the federal deficit or
payroll, officials said.
    The legislation would not in itself alter the terms of
federal credit programs.
    But officials said they would be pleased if Congress
tightened some programs after seeing their true cost set out in
the budget.
    The program would call for the immediate sale of many newly
made direct federal loans, but would no effect existing federal
loan portfolios. Some of these are already proposed to be sold
off under previous administration programs.
    Exempt from the sale requirement would be loans made under
the Commodity Credit Corp commodity loan program, which the
government considers to be a commodity purchase program rather
than a credit program, and defaulted guaranteed loans, which
the government considers to be the same as direct loans.
    Also excluded from the sale requirement would be most
foreign loans, though officials said they may at some point
consider selling off some Export-Import Bank loans.
    Officials said government loan programs currently amount to
about 252 billion dlrs in direct loans and 450 billion dlrs in
guaranteed loans a year.
    Officials said U.S. agencies were asked to calculate the
approximate cost of their loan subsidies by looking at
comparable loans in the marketplace.
    The administration is asking Congress to begin reflecting
the cost of these subsidies in the fiscal 1988 budget, which
the House Budget Committee plans to begin marking up late next
week.
    Officials said the reforms, if adopted across-the-board by
all affected congressional committees, would lower the federal
deficit by only 100 mln dlrs in fiscal 1988.
    Officials said the administration hopes to sell a total of
13.0 billion dlrs in loan assets during fiscal 1988, including
1.8 billion dlrs in loan assets under the credit reform program
and 11.2 billion dlrs in loan assets already in the
governemnt's portfolion.
    In fiscal 1989, the administration hopes to sell 8.9
billion dlrs in loans, including 1.3 billion dlrs of loans
under the credit reform program and 7.6 billion dlrs from the
existing portfolio.

investment needed to generate growth and earn the money to
service the debt.
    He said the process of restoring external balance to the

needed economic adjustment will require a relative shift of
financial and real resources into internationally competitive

Iowa Beef Processors Inc is lifting a
lockout at its Dakota City, Nebraska, processing plant and
plans to resume operations March 16, United Food and Commercial
Workers (UFCW) Union spokesman Allen Zack said.
    Iowa Beef mailed a letter to members of UFCW Local 222
informing them a lockout imposed by the company December 14
would be lifted and meatpackers could return to work under Iowa
Beef's "revised, last and best final offer," Zack said.
    Iowa Beef had closed the plant indefinitely in mid-December
because it said it had no alternative to threats by meatpackers
to disrupt operations.
    About 2,800 members of Local 222 are affected by the
shutdown. A 3-1/2 year labor contract at the plant expired
December 13.

Allied-Lyons PLC <ALLD.L> and Canada's
Reichmann brothers are working well together as partners and
currently do not plan any change in their joint ownership of
distiller Hiram Walker-Gooderham and Worts, Allied-Lyons
chairman Derrick Holden-Brown said.
    Allied-Lyons got 51 pct control of Hiram Walker-Gooderham
last year for about 600 mln U.S. dlrs, while the Reichmanns'
<Gulf Canada Corp> acquired 49 pct in an out-of-court pact
after a hostile battle for the wine and spirits division of
<Hiram Walker Resources Ltd>.
    "We are getting along very well as partners ... I hope
there won't be any change, but there could be," Holden-Brown
told reporters after a speech in Toronto.
    He said Allied-Lyons has a two-year call option that could
force Gulf Canada to sell its 49 pct stake to Allied-Lyons, and
Gulf Canada has a two-year put option that could obligate
Allied-Lyons to buy its 49 pct.
    "Both we and Gulf hope very much there will be no occasion
for either the put or call to be exercised," Holden-Brown said.
    In answer to a reporter's question, Holden-Brown said it
would be possible for Gulf Canada to sell off part of its 49
pct in a public offering with Allied-Lyons' consent. "I don't
think we would have any objection to it," he added.
    Allied-Lyons maintains control of Hiram Walker-Gooderham's
board of directors and has total responsibility for its
management. "We cannot contemplate giving up our control," he
said.
    Holden-Brown would not disclose how big a profit
contribution the distiller will make in Allied-Lyons' financial
results, but he said "it will be substantial."
    "I am not able to give profit forecasts," he said.
    Holden-Brown said Allied-Lyons was able to finance the
Hiram Walker-Gooderham acquisition with cash and borrowings,
and has no current plans for a stock issue.
    He said the company is not currently negotiating any more
acquisitions in Canada but has a team of officials evaluating
possible purchases of wines, spirits, soft drinks or food
concerns. "I don't think we shall be looking at the brewery
scene (which is) highly concentrated already," he added.
    Holden-Brown said Allied-Lyons plans to list its shares on
Canadian stock exchanges, possibly later this year.

Farm credit conditions showed
further signs of stabilizing in the plains and mountain states
during the fourth quarter of 1986, according to bankers
surveyed by the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank.
    The rate of loan repayment improved as one of every four
bankers reported higher loan repayment rates than a year ago.
Respondents said interest rates continued to edge lower.
    However, the decline in farm real estate values quickened
after moderating through the year, dropping an average four
pct. Farmland values averaged 14 pct lower than a year earlier
and 55 pct below 1981's peak values.
    The survey authors blamed the drop on depressed crop prices
and uncertainty about the future of government crop programs.
    Farm loan demand was the lowest since 1986 with only 13 pct
of the survey respondents reporting an increase in loan demand.
The also reported that 25 pct of the non-farm businesses in
their areas were having severe financial problems, and said the

The use of generic in-kind commodity
certificates has helped ease storage problems and is a
necessary part of export promotion programs, a senior executive
for the world's largest grain company said.
    Testifying before the House Agriculture subcommittee on
wheat, soybeans and feedgrains, Robbin Johnson, vice president
of Cargill, Inc., disputed claims that U.S. grain companies
have made huge profits from certificate trading.
    "The certs program is not in any way a windfall to the
trade," he said. Johnson said that Cargill has been dealing
with a two pct spread in certificate transactions, and that
this is within the normal grain marketing levels.
    Johnson recognized current concern over the cost of
certificates as compared to cash, but said that critics need to
look more closely at the savings caused by certs, noting for
example that widespread use of certs in the PIK and Roll
marketing technique last summer helped ease storage costs.
    Certificates are also an important part of any export
promotion program, he said.
    "The more you look at ways to expand export markets, the
more you have to look at ways to expand certs to put more grain
into the market to meet demand," he said.
    Subcommittee chairman Dan Glickman (D-Kans.) said his
committee would be looking at the certificate program later
this year and studying the General Accounting Office report on
certificate costs.

Dome Petroleum Ltd said a
majority of a group of 56 major creditors support the company's
revised proposal to restructure debt of more than 6.1 billion
Canadian dlrs.
    Outlining terms of the plan circulated to the lenders
earlier this week, the company said it is seeking approval in
principle for the proposal "within the next several weeks" in
order to implement the debt rescheduling by June 30, 1987.
    "Although at today's price levels it only allows the company
to struggle on, benefits appear as oil prices rise," Dome
chairman J. Howard Macdonald said in a statement.
    "We believe the plan is a rational one, and will be valid
under a range of circumstances," chairman Macdonald said.
    The lenders previously agreed to an interim debt
rescheduling until June 30 to allow Dome time to negotiate a
long-term recapitalization.
    The debt proposal is designed to ensure continued existence
of the company, which would see lenders get maximum recovery of
their loans, Dome said.
    The plan would maintain debt levels within Dome's ability
to pay, subject to minimum debt service levels for each lender.
    Dome said the debt proposal offers measures such as equity
conversion options and reclassification to lower interest
bearing categories of debt to accomplish its objectives.
    Under certain circumstances, lenders will have the option
to convert all or part of their debt to common shares at a
pre-determined conversion rate upon plan implementation.
    The various conversion rates remain to be set through
negotiations, and the company said it is impossible to predict
the extent to which the conversion option will be exercised and
the amount of dilution that may result.
    Converting debt to common shares after the plan is
implemented would be at a much higher conversion price, Dome
said.
    Common shareholders will be asked to approve the plan
before it is put in place.
    Debt that remains after share conversion will either
receive scheduled payments based on contract interest rates and
a 15 to 20 year pay-out, or interest rates indexed to oil
prices. The company will use both an annual security-to-debt
ratio test and a monthly cash flow test to classify which
interest payments are paid on the different portions of debt.
    To achieve a stable operating base for the company, the
plan provides for deducting operating costs, capital
expenditures and general and administrative expenses before the
remaining available cash flow is distributed to lenders, Dome
said.
    The proposal also assumes efforts will continue to operate
the business as efficiently as possible, it said.
    As the company previously said, debt payments from cash
flow be divided into two broad categories, secured and
unsecured creditors.
    Terms of the debt plan include paying institutional
unsecured creditors, comprising mostly banks who hold private
debt, from cash flow generated by unpledged assets. This
portion will get a fixed low interest rate under a 15-year
repayment schedule.
    Remaining institutional unsecured debt will get paid
through convertible, oil indexed unsecured debt that matures in
20 years, or any available excess cash flow, or conversion to
equity. Any institutional lender also has the option of taking
all or part of its debt in common shares.
    To offer public unsecured debtholders liquidity, Dome said
they can also convert all or part of their debt to common
shares when the plan is implemented. Any debt leftover would be
exchanged for a convertible debenture with an interest rate
linked to oil prices.
    Secured creditors would get paid from cashflow generated by
the assets pledged against their debt under a complex formula,
the company said.
    Any shortfalls under the formula could also be converted to
oil-linked debentures.

Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul
Volcker said severe problems remain in some sectors of the U.S.
economy despite progress in others.
    "Severe problems in some sectors of the economy are all too
obvious," he said in remarks prepared for delivery to a
luncheon of business leaders here.
    He said oil exploration and development, as well as
agricultural prices, have been heavily affected by worldwide
surpluses.
    Commercial construction, he said, is suffering from earlier
over-building in many areas.
    More broadly, he said, there are distortions and imbalances
in the U.S. economy that cut across many sectors.
    "Unless dealt with effectively and forcibly, they will
undermine all that has been achieved," Volcker warned.
    He said one problem is that economic activity over the past
two years has been supported largely by consumption.
    He said that rising consumption was achieved at the expense
of reduced personal savings. At the same time, he said, the
huge Federal budget deficit is absorbing a disproportionate
amount of the savings generated in the U.S.
    Volcker said the adverse consequences of the combination of
low savings rates and high Federal budget deficits have been
escaped by drawing on capital from abroad.
    He noted that the net flow of foreign capital into the U.S.
in 1986 exceeded all the savings by U.S. households.
    "That is a graphic demonstration of the extent to which
our financial markets are hostage to possible changes in
external attitudes and circumstances," Volcker said.

The House Ways and Means Trade 
Subcommittee unanimously approved a toned-down version of
legislation designed to toughen U.S. trade laws and wedge open
foreign markets to more U.S. goods.
    The measure now goes to the full House Ways and Means
Committee next week, but major changes are not expected,
congressional sources said.
    "This product could very well be toughening our trade policy
and doing it in a manner that opens markets without this
frightening word 'protectionism'," Ways and Means chairman Dan
Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat said.
    The trade subcommittee backed away from mandating specific
retaliation against foreign countries for unfair foreign trade
practices as the House had approved in a trade bill last year.
    But it held over for the full Ways and Means Committee
debate on a controversial plan by Rep. Richard Gephardt to
mandate a reduction in trade surpluses with the U.S. by
countries such as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.
    Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat, has not decided the exact
form of his amendment, an aide said. Last year the House
approved his idea to force an annual ten pct trade surplus cut
by those countries. 
    The trade bill will be wrapped in with legislation from
other committees dealing with relaxation of export controls,
incentives for research, expanded worker training and education
and other efforts to increase U.S. competitiveness.
    The comprehensive trade bill is to be considered by the
full House in late April and then will be considered by Senate
committees.
    It requires President Reagan to retaliate against foreign
unfair trade practices but do not mandate quotas or tariffs and
allow an exemption if U.S. economic security would be harmed by
U.S. actions against other countries.
    The bill would make it easier for U.S. industries to win
relief from surges of imports of competitive products.
    It extends until January 1993, the administration's
authority to negotiate trade agreements as part of the new
round of multilateral talks under the General Agreements on
Tariffs and Trade.
    And, it includes provisions to tighten trade rules on
copyrights, patents and telecommunications goods.

Live cattle futures posted a robust
rally today after a major beef packing company said it would
end a lockout at its slaughtering plant in Dakota City, Neb.
    April delivery cattle on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
closed at 64.45 cents a pound, up 0.83 cent, as the market
expected demand for live animals to increase as the plant
restarts operations.
    Iowa Beef Processors, a division of Occidental Petroleum,
said it planned to reopen the plant, one of the largest in the
nation, on March 16. The plant has been closed since Dec. 14,
the day after a contract between IBP and Local 222 of the
United Food and Commercial Workers Union expired.
    The plant employs 2,800 workers and can slaughter several
thousand animals a day, a company spokesman said.
    The company said it locked out union workers because they
threatened to disrupt operations. It was unclear whether union
meatpackers would return to work. They rejected the company's
latest contract offer March 5.
    Traders said cattle prices advanced at midsession as rumors
circulated that the lockout was ending, and gains were further
fueled by a noticeable increase in demand for live animals on
cash markets in Nebraska and the Texas Panhandle.
    The rally in cattle also boosted values of live hogs and
frozen pork bellies, which also were supported by indications
that producers were expanding their hog herds at a slower rate
than previously expected.
    Petroleum futures posted a modest rally on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.
    But a report that the Soviet Union planned to reduce the
price of its crude oil exports may pressure the market Friday,
said Nauman Barakat, petroleum analyst in New York with Smith
Barney, Harris Upham and Co.
    Buying by companies that deal in petroleum helped prices
recover from early weakness, traders said.
    Gold futures rallied, partly in response to strength in the
silver market, on the Commodity Exchange in New York. Silver
prices rallied after a U.S. brokerage house recommended its
customers buy the metal, traders said.
    Coffee futures drifted lower in response to a report that
Colombia lowered the price of its exports, traders said.
    Sugar prices closed slightly higher on the Coffee, Sugar
and Cocoa Exchange despite a large export sale by the European
Commission on Wednesday.
    Soybeans were higher, wheat lower and corn mixed on the
Chicago Board of Trade.
    Soybeans were boosted by expectations that the Agriculture
Department would report a healthy signup for the Conservation
Reserve Program, which pays farmers to leave highly erodible
land idle instead of planting a crop, traders said.
    Concern that a strike by Brazilian seamen might interrupt
exports of soybeans from Brazil, where the harvest is just
beginning, also underpinned prices, they said.
    Wheat prices were pressured by selling in response to
trends on price charts, they said.

The Securities and Exchange
Commission asked the New York Stock Exchange to tighten an
experimental procedure used in the past six months to dampen
volatility linked to the so-called "triple-witching hour."
    The Big Board has been collecting and publicizing
information on large imbalances of "market-on-close" (MOC)
orders placed on 50 major stocks one-half-hour before closing
on so-called expiration Fridays in September and December.
    Expiration Fridays, or triple witching hours, occur every
three months when stock options, stock index options and
futures on index options expire simultaneously.
    As aribrageurs liquidated their futures and options on
previous expiration Fridays, they sold huge amounts of stock
which they had used to offset their positions.
    The huge sell orders, which usually entered the market in
the final frantic minutes on expiration Fridays triggered wild
price swings in the 50 stocks which serve as the basis for the
options and futures.
    The gyrations prompted the SEC last September to request
that the Big Board ask its members submit all MOCs by 1530 hrs
on expiration Fridays, which would then be made public, giving
the market a half-hour to settle order imbalances.
    But in a March 12 letter to NYSE President Robert Birnbaum,
SEC Director of Market Regulation cited problems in the
experimental procedure during the Dec 19 expiration Friday.
    A large number of MOC buy orders were not placed until
after 1530 EST on Dec 19, which helped send the Dow Jones
Industrial Average up 21 points in the final minutes of the day
to a 14.20-point gain on the day, Ketchum said.
    Citing the SEC's concern about such trading, Ketchum asked
the exchange to tighten its procedure by not accepting any
pre-existing MOC orders after 1530 if they could have been
placed earlier.
    The new restriction, which SEC officials said merely
clarifies the terms of the existing experimental procedure,
would bar the liquidation of stocks through MOC orders for
arbitrage purposes after 1530 hrs, even if they offset other
reported order imbalances in those stocks.
    The only MOC orders the SEC will allow to be placed after
1530 EST on March 20, the next expiration Friday, are those
that are received by Big Board member firms after 1530 EST and
which help reduce existing order imbalances, Ketchum said.
    If there are no published imbalances in a particular stock,
no MOC orders will be accepted in that stock, he said.
    "If dissemination of MOC orders is to provide an accurate
indication of true order imbalances, then all existing MOC
orders must be submitted by 3:30 p.m. and only those new MOC
orders responding to reported imbalances can be permitted,"
Ketchum said.
    The letter did not say how the SEC or the NYSE would
determine the difference between pre-existing MOC orders that
would be barred, and new MOC orders that would be allowed to
reduce imbalances. But an SEC official said the agency hopes
the NYSE and its members would adhere to the rules "in a spirit
of cooperation."

In order to accomodate the shift in the
settlement procedure for options on the Standard and Poor's 500
stock index that the exchange announced last month, the Chicago
Board Options Exchange (CBOE) said it has created a new class
of options for the S and P contract <SPX>.
    The CBOE's new contract was needed to coincide with changes
in the settlement procedure that the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange (CME) made on its S and P 500 futures and options
contract which will be implemented with the expiration of the
June contract.
    Settlement of the CBOE's new option contract will be based
on the opening price of the S and P 500 index on expiraton day,
while settlement of the current contract is based on the
closing price of the index.
    "CBOE doesn't think that opening settlement is the solution
to the expiration effect, but we cannot exposure investors in
our market to unanticipated risks arising from different
settlement times in options and futures," CBOE chairman Alger
Chapman said in a release.
    "We're taking this step to give investors a choice of
settlement times that meet their hedging needs," Chapman said.
    The new contract was necessary because the Options Clearing
Corp (OCC) did not allow its member exchanges to modify terms
of any of its outstanding contracts, the CBOE said.
    The new contract will satisfy the needs of customers who
require an options contract based on opening prices of the
index, the CBOE said.
    The opening settlement contract will trade parallel to the
closing settlement contract as long as the CME maintains its
opening settlement procedure for the S and P 500 futures
contract, a CBOE spokesperson said.
    However, she noted that customer preference for one type of
settlement procedure will eventually determine which contract
will prevail.
    The opening settlement contract will trade on a March,
June, September, December quarterly expiration cycle and will
be listed as soon as the OCC revises its contract prospectus,
possible in April, the exchange said.

U.S. bank reserve, monetary and
discount window borrowings data released by the Federal Reserve
today clearly indicate that policy is "on hold" and may not be
changed for weeks or even months, economists said.
    "The Fed is keeping policy at dead center and it is not
about to change policy unless something fairly dramatic occurs
on the economy," said John Williams of Bankers Trust Co.
    "These numbers contain no hint that a policy shift is in
prospect, nor do economic or financial developments argue for
policy change," said William Griggs of Griggs and Santow Inc.
    Fed data released today were all in line with economists'
expectations and similar to the numbers of recent weeks.
    The Fed said net discount window borrowings in the two
weeks ended Wednesday averaged 191 mln dlrs, up from 381 mln
dlrs in the February 25 statement period, but little changed
from 160 mln dlrs in the period before that.
    It said that banks' net free reserves in the latest two
weeks averaged 660 mln dlrs versus 675 mln dlrs previously.
    Finally, the Fed said that the M-1 money supply fell 800
mln dlrs in February, with the broader M-2 measure down 1.6
billion dlrs and M-3 up an even three billion dlrs.
    Analysts said that M-1 last month grew at a negative 1.3
pct annual rate compared with minus 0.7 pct for M-2 and actual
positive growth of 1.0 pct annualized for M-3.
    February levels of M-2 and M-3 left the aggregates 18.2 and
20.8 billion dlrs under their respective upper growth limits
set by the Fed for 1987. The annual growth target for both is
5-1/2 to 8-1/2 pct. There is no M-1 target.
    "In the near term, there is absolutely no reason for the
Fed to ease policy, even apart from the slowdown in money
growth," said Stephen Slifer, economist at Lehman Government
Securities Inc.
    Economists generally expect a modest pickup in monetary
growth in March after February's anemic growth rates. However,
they stress that money growth will not be strong enough to
prevent the Fed from dropping interest rates further if the
economy shows evidence of weakness.
    Commenting on February's decline in the key M-2 aggregate,
Slifer said the main cause was a 3.2 billion dlr drop in money
market deposits at banks. This number has risen three to four
billion dlrs a month for a long while, he said, so February's
weakness is not likely to persist. Slifer expects modest M-2
and M-3 growth rates of 3-1/2 to four pct during March.
    Griggs said that M-2 and M-3 in coming months should return
to the five to seven pct annualized growth region and so
continue to present no problem for the Fed.
    Economists said the Fed appears to be very comfortable with
its current policy stance and it is likely to wait for perhaps
several more months of economic data before deciding whether or
not to ease its grip on reserves.
    Given the economy's fragility in many sectors, the analysts
agreed that there is almost no chance that the Fed will choose
to raise, rather than lower, interest rates when it next
changes policy.
    "Discount window borrowings in the past week were about as
low as the Fed can get them, although Fed funds held above six
pct," said Williams of Bankers Trust. Funds averaged 6.12 pct
in the week to Wednesday, up from 6.06 pct in the prior week.
    The Fed added reserves indirectly via one billion dlrs of
customer repurchase agreements last Friday, 2.5 billion dlrs on
Monday and two billion dlrs on Wednesday. On Tuesday, it added
reserves directly through two-day System repurchases.
    Williams and Griggs agreed the Fed will let the funds rate
be largely market-driven. They said it is focusing instead on a
borrowings target of around 300 mln dlrs.

difficult to find "the best price" for transactions in U.K.
Government bonds (gilts) and have become more active in the
market since the deregulation of the London Stock Exchange in
October, agency broker Capel-Cure Myers said in a survey.
    The survey, covering a broad section of institutional
investors, also showed that investors were uneasy about the
impartiality of market makers' advice. Given their concerns,
over half those surveyed said they spend more time managing
their portfolios. At the same time, the investors believed the
market was more liquid and efficient than before Big Bang.
    Capel-Cure, a unit of Australia and New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd, conducted the survey during January among 70
institutions which are not clients of that firm.
    Banks and merchant banks accounted for 32 pct of the total,
building societies 30 pct, life assurance companies 20 pct,
insurance companies 11 pct and pension funds seven pct.
    The survey found that with the virtual elimination of
commissions, the improved market liquidity has encouraged
investors to deal more frequently in the market. Of those
responding, 70 pct were encouraged to deal more actively, 25
pct which saw no change and five pct dealt less actively.
    A Capel-Cure official told reporters the elimination of
commissions has made the market more competitive.
    He said Capel-Cure has deliberately set low commisstions
because of this.
    Nearly half the respondents said they now have their own
dealing team to cope with the new market, although the
definition of a "dealing team" was ambiguous, the survey said.
    Rather than being a self-contained, specialised group of
dealers who spend all their time searching for prices, the
definition now appears to be the less formal idea of a
multi-purpose fund manager, it said.
    The survey supported the general view in the gilt market
that a shake-out of the 27 market-makers is likely.
    It showed nearly 90 pct of the respondents believed that
the total number of market makers in three years time would be
less than 20, while 46 pct thought the number would be less
than 15.
    Some 79 pct of respondents said they expect the number of
agency brokers (for which there was no estimate) to fall over
the next three years. Unlike broker/dealers, agency brokers do
not take positions in the market, but the survey showed 68 pct
of respondents did not consider this very important when
deciding whether to use one.

The U.S. Has given further details
of an action program announced yesterday aimed at helping
sub-Saharan Africa overcome hunger and economic problems,
senior U.S. Offficials said.
    Under the new program, a 500-mln dlr Development Fund for
Africa will be set up to consolidate most of the aid money
going to the continent to replace the large number of bilateral
accounts currently in existence.
    Chester Crocker, assistant secretary of state for Africa,
said he believed Congress will favour the program, which stems
from a U.N. Conference on Africa's economic problems.
    The 500-mln dlr fund, coupled with an additional 100 mln
dlrs in food aid, would surpass Congress' 1986 vote of 483 mln
dlrs for equivalent programs, officials said.
    Washington is also increasing its funding to the
International Development Agency (IDA), the World Bank's soft
loan affiliate, and is seeking a greater share of a bigger fund
for Africa, they said.
    Officials said under the last IDA replenishment Africa got

Senior U.S. Economic officials
disagree on the likelihood the government can meet its budget
deficit reduction targets.
    Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of the Council of Economic
Advisers, reiterated the Reagan Administration's opposition to
a tax increase and its pledge to reduce the deficit by cutting
spending and fostering economic growth.
    By contrast, Rudolph Penner, Director of the Congressional
Budget Office, said the budget process has broken down and the
deficit will remain close to 200 billion dlrs for fiscal 1987.
    Sprinkel told a symposium sponsored by New York University
that spending could be cut by avoiding decisions based on the
desire to influence votes and by shifting the responsibility
for local projects to state governments.
    He also suggested a line-item veto, which allows the
President to veto parts of bill without rejecting all of it, to
limit wasteful spending. Spending and taxing decisions should
be linked more closely.
    Sprinkel said the Administration still looks for 2.7 pct
growth in U.S. Real gross national product (GNP) in 1987 and
3.5 pct in 1988.
    Asked if the latest economic reports signal this rate of
economic growth is attainable, Sprinkel said, "It looks pretty
good to me. We've had two very strong employment reports."
    He also said federal reserve policy is appropriate, adding,
"It looks like they're on track."
    While further reductions are needed in the trade deficit,
Sprinkel said the lower dollar is having an impact.
    The new 1987 tax laws will not hurt the economy and the tax
reform act of 1986 significantly lowers tax rates and will
greatly increase private production incentives, he said.
    "Our estimates at the Council of Economic Advisers suggest
national net output of goods and services will permanently
increase by approximately two pct because of the long-run
consequences of tax reform," Sprinkel said. "In 1986, this would
have amounted to an increase of approximately 600 dlrs in the
income of the average American family."
    Sprinkel also argued the 1981 tax cuts were not responsible
for the large increase in the budget deficit.
    In fiscal 1986 ending September, federal spending amounted
to 23.8 pct of GNP, while federal receipts absorbed 18.5 pct of
GNP, leaving a deficit of 5.3 pct, he said.
    Sprinkel said that, compared with fiscal 1978, the 1986
federal expenditure share of GNP is 2.7 percentage points
higher and the revenue share of GNP is virtually the same.
    "Contrary to the conventional wisdom, therefore, the 1981
tax cut is not the root cause of the extraordinary budget
deficits of the past few years," Sprinkel said.
    "This tax cut merely rolled back the inflation-induced tax
increases that occurred between 1978 and 1981," he added.
    However, the Congressional Budget Office's Rudolph Penner
argued that the tax cut in 1981 was misguided.
    "Since making the big mistake in 1981 of cutting taxes
enormously without any plan to decrease spending by the
Administration or Congress, indeed with increases in defence
spending, now all the options (for reducing the budget deficit)
are unpleasant," he said.
    Penner said the tax cut resulted from the ideological
turmoil in the U.S. Caused by the "biggest sustained inflation
in our nation's history," which helped foster widespread
distrust of government.
    "The American people turned on the government with tax
revolt at the state level and new demands on the government at
the national level," Penner said.
    "But their dislike of taxes exceeded their general dislike
of spending programs. Now the correction of that 1981 mistake
demands that the system change a lot."
    Penner sees little hope the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget
deficit reduction targets will be met and said the deficit will
remain at roughly 200 billion dlrs this year.
    He said a budget process that sets targets arbitrarily is
not likely to succeed.
    "I feel pretty safe in saying that any process that tries to
dictate a numerical outcome from above is doomed to fail simply
because there's no ... Way to enforce it," Penner said.
    Penner questioned the methods by which the 1987 budget
deficit was cut. He said 18 to 19 billion dlrs were eliminated
by one-time measures, such as a temporary increase in taxes
related to tax reform and sales of government assets.
    "Another four billion dlrs was cut by what I call creative
timing changes, like moving the military payday from the last
day of fiscal 1987 to the first day of fiscal 1988. That saved
more than two billion dlrs," Penner said.

Japanese shipbuilders have applied to the

tonnage built to about half of total capacity for the year

    Under the plan, 33 yards capable of building ships of more
than 10,000 gross tons will curtail operations to three mln
compensated gross registered tonnes (CGRT) a year against
capacity of about six mln CGRT.
    The Transport Ministry estimates new orders at 3.3 mln CGRT
in the year to March 1988 and 3.1 mln the following year.
    The industry has curtailed production due to oversupply
nearly every year since 1977/78, under cartel or Transport
Ministry guidelines. The latest guidelines call for a ceiling
of four mln CGRT in the year to March 31.
    The cartels, self-imposed and self-regulated, are not
legally binding, but industry finds it in its own interest to
stick to them.
    The slowdown in orders has been caused by the strong yen
and a protracted worldwide shipbuilding slump.

The Finance Ministry has clarified

critics who charged the rules were too tightly-drawn, ministry

    A foreign investment management company will be permitted
to employ only one fund manager in Japan, with another on
standby in the home country. Domestic companies must have two.
    In deciding whether a Japanese subsidiary of a foreign firm
is eligible to manage funds in Japan, the ministry will take
account of the amount of funds the parent company has under
management, a ministry official said.
    "This should make it very easy for foreign firms to meet the
criteria for a licence," he said without elaborating.
    He said the ministry expects to grant the first investment
management licences by the end of June. Some 135 firms,
including some 15 foreign companies, will probably be licensed
under the new law passed late last year.

A mix of electoral boldness and fiscal
caution is expected from Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
Lawson next week when he unveils his budget for fiscal 1987/88.
    Exceptionally robust tax revenues have given Lawson very
favourable budget options with which to please voters, industry
and financial markets alike.
    The budget will Lawson's fourth, and probably the last from
the Conservative government before the next general election,
political analysts say.
    Analysts said the major budget question is how Lawson will
balance expected tax cuts with lower public borrowing, and
allow for fresh falls in U.K. Interest rates.
    They said a boost given to the economy by consumer spending
has helped reduce the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement
(PSBR) for financial 1986/87 from an originally targetted 7.1
billion stg, despite big rises in government spending.
    Economists say Lawson may have up to five billion stg to
split between income tax cuts and other electoral "sweeteners,"
higher spending and a drop in borrowing, while still meeting
his earlier 1987/88 PSBR target of 7.0 billion stg.
    The decision facing Lawson is how best to use that
so-called "fiscal adjustement" to maximise the government's
all-round popularity ahead of the next general election.
    Economist Ian Harwood of Warburg Securities said Lawson's
budget must strike a balance between tax cuts aimed at home
consumption and lower public borrowing for attracting support
from overseas investors.
    Peter Fellner of James Capel and Co said "a budget which
concentrates on tax cuts for the consumer will be a budget for
an early election."
    Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher must call a poll before
June, 1988. But anticipation of a summer or autumn 1987 ballot
has risen as the opposition Labour Party has slipped in voter
surveys. Forecasts that the economy may deteriorate later this
year add to arguments for an early poll, analysts say.
    The Conservatives have pledged to cut the basic rate of
taxation in the U.K. From the current 29 pct level to 25 pct.
    While confirming that aim, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
last month seemed to dash speculation that that would happen in
the near future. She said in a television interview that it
would happen "Eventually. But I think it will be eventually."
    Most market analysts now expect a two-pence reduction in
the basic rate of taxation and a lowering in of the top rate of
income tax from 60 pct.
    A one billion stg cut in the 1987/88 PSBR - to six billion
stg - is considered the minimum needed for reassuring financial
markets, they add.
    The Treasury's inflow of tax receipts has far surpassed
that previously envisaged, economists say. Lawson as recently
as December 17 said that "I very much doubt whether there will
be much scope for reductions in taxation in next year's budget."
    The Conservative government is eager to get the basic rate
of tax down to 25 pct as soon as possible, since every pound
off the tax base would make the opposition Labour Party's
spending plans look more painful to the electorate, analysts
say.
    The direct revenue effect of a one penny change in the
basic rate of income tax would be about 1.1 billion stg in
1987/88 and 1.45 billion stg in 1988/89, Treasury figures show.
    Lawson's budget speech to Parliament on Tuesday starts at
1530 GMT, and is sure to echo the government's distinct tone of
optimism, analysts say.
     The tax measures which Lawson is expected to announce will
be based firmly on a positive assessment of past economic
achievements and confidence for the future, they add.
    But even if he does cut his planned PSBR for 1987/88 by
between one and 1.5 billion stg, as most economists predict,
Lawson is still likely to find himself announcing a higher PSBR
than the outturn for this financial year.^M
    That could leave him with a presentation problem,
economists say.
    A lower PSBR would raise financial confidence by reassuring
markets that the borrowing burden imposed by the government
would stay low even if certain key aspects of the budget's
arithmetic seem over-optimistic, economists say
    Lawson is slated to reaffirm the government's goals, as set
out in its Medium Term Financial Strategy (MTFS), of reducing
inflation and raising economic growth.
    Regarding monetary targets, some analysts expect him to
drop the wayward broad money aggregate, sterling M-3, while
retaining the tamer M0 narrow measure. Few foresee any other
monetary aggregate being chosen by Lawson for formal targeting.
    Analysts were surprised this week when the government
sanctioned a half percentage point cut in interest rates, in an
attempt to cool down sterling and the gilts market. Analysts
had expected the authorities to wait until after the budget.
    Further declines in bank base lending rates are anticipated
after the budget. Many analysts foresee them falling by as much
as a full percentage point from the current 10.5 pct level.
    The main electoral attraction of reducing interest rates is
to cut mortgage borrowing costs, and thus reduce inflation,
analysts say. Each one percentage point cut in the mortgage
rate reduces retail prices by 0.4 pct, government figures show.

for 10-year bond auctions.
    Japanese securities houses also may allow foreign brokers
to underwrite more 10-year bonds from April. Four U.S. Banks
are expected to receive Finance Ministry approval in late April
to operate securities subsidiaries in Japan as long as they
hold no more than 50 pct of the capital, bankers said.
    These firms are likely to join the syndicate, which will
increase the number of participants in the 10-year government
bond primary market, securities managers said.
    Each of the 17 current foreign securities houses in the
syndicate underwrites 0.07 pct of each issue, they said.
    In order to expand participation by foreigners, the
syndicate must either expand the securities industry's 26 pct
share or introduce auctions to the primary market, they said.
    Local brokers have requested the head of the syndicate, now
Fuji Bank Ltd, to increase their share to 30.7 pct but banks
oppose any cut in their 74 pct share, bankers said.

the October-December quarter rose four pct from a year earlier
to 5,654 billion yen against a 2.6 pct year-on-year rise in the

France's 1986 budget deficit has been
revised down to 141.1 billion francs from the estimate at the
end of last year of 143.6 billion, the Finance Ministry said.
    This compares with the 1985 budget deficit of 153.3 billion
francs and the deficit target for this year of 129 billion.
    The ministry said it was the first time since 1980 that the
final budget deficit had been below the initial target.
    The budget deficit corresponded to 2.87 pct of the gross
domestic product (GDP), down from 3.35 pct in 1985.
    This year the government is aiming to cut the budget
deficit to 2.5 pct, reducing it further to two pct in 1988.
    Expenditure totalled 1,228 billion francs last year, up 6.1
pct from 1985, while receipts rose 7.3 pct to 1,076 billion.
    The 1986 budget deficit excludes IMF credits and activities
of the exchange stabilisation fund, but takes account of a four
billion franc payment to the public debt depreciation fund from
income from the privatisation programme.
    The ministry also said that the 1986 expenditure total
included the integration into the general budget of Treasury
loans to the steel industry, which had a neutral impact on the
deficit but boosted the spending figure.

    A foreign investment management company will be permitted

The supervisory board of the
European consortium, <Airbus Industrie>, has begun a critical
meeting to review government funding and airline orders for its
proposed A340 long range jet, Airbus officials here said.
    Airbus insists it needs five airlines to firmly commit
themselves to the plane before going ahead with the project by
the month's end, the deadline for its launch.
    The plane, a four-engined widebodied jet, has so far only
been bought by one airline -- <Lufthansa>, which has placed 15
firm orders and 15 options for the plane.
    But while Air France has said it wants to buy seven of the
aircraft, it has not yet formally placed an order. Discussions
with up to a dozen other airlines have not yet resulted in
public commitments.
    Apart from a shortage of orders, Airbus also is facing an
uphill struggle persuading its member governments to fund the
2.5 billion dlr project, which involves not only the A340 but
its sister A330 aircraft, a twin engined, wide bodied medium
range jet with many identical components.
    The British government remains unconvinced that there will
be sufficient room in the world long range jet market.
    The West German government is also uncommitted, and is
currently pressing for a restructuring of the consortium's West
German company, <Deutsche Airbus GmbH>, while only the French
government appears to be fully behind the program.
    Another major factor delaying a final decision on the plane
has been the engine which will power it. Airbus agreed last
October with <CFM International> that its CFM-56 engine with
28,600 lbs of thrust would power the plane. But in December,
Airbus announced an agreement with CFM rival <International
Aero Engine> (IAE) to power a slightly larger version of the
A340 with a 30,000 lb thrust high-technology superfan engine.
   Airbus has made clear to potential customers that the IAE
engine is now the principle engine for the project.  The
incorporation of the superfan engine made the plane on paper
more attractive to airlines, but the engine has yet to be
developed and CFM International had openly expressed scepticism
that the engine will be ready when the plane goes into service.
    The future of the Airbus consortium depends on the right
decision being made on the A340 in the next few weeks, for it
could find itself severely exposed in the 1990s either by
staying absent from the long range jet market or by committing
itself to a commercially unviable project.

the commercial and industrial objectives ... Have been
fulfilled and that a strong basis for a commercially successful
programme has been established," the communique said.
    But the consortium still has to obtain funding guarantees
from its member governments for the 2.5 billion dlr programme.
    The nine committed customers are well above the five
airlines that the consortium said it needed to launch the plane
project.
    "Therefore the supervisory board has decided to take all
necessary steps for a formal launch decision by mid-April 1987
to ensure first deliveries of the A340 in May 1992, to be
followed by first deliveries of the A330 a year later," it said.

Senior U.S. Economic officials
disagree on the likelihood the government can meet its budget
deficit reduction targets.
    Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of the Council of Economic
Advisers, reiterated the Reagan Administration's opposition to
a tax increase and its pledge to reduce the deficit by cutting
spending and fostering economic growth.
    By contrast, Rudolph Penner, Director of the Congressional
Budget Office, said the budget process has broken down and the
deficit will remain close to 200 billion dlrs for fiscal 1987.
    Sprinkel told a symposium sponsored by New York University
that spending could be cut by avoiding decisions based on the
desire to influence votes and by shifting the responsibility
for local projects to state governments.
    He also suggested a line-item veto, which allows the
President to veto parts of bill without rejecting all of it, to
limit wasteful spending. Spending and taxing decisions should
be linked more closely.
    Sprinkel said the Administration still looks for 2.7 pct
growth in U.S. Real gross national product (GNP) in 1987 and
3.5 pct in 1988.
    Asked if the latest economic reports signal this rate of
economic growth is attainable, Sprinkel said, "It looks pretty
good to me. We've had two very strong employment reports."
    He also said federal reserve policy is appropriate, adding,
"It looks like they're on track."
    While further reductions are needed in the trade deficit,
Sprinkel said the lower dollar is having an impact.
    The new 1987 tax laws will not hurt the economy and the tax
reform act of 1986 significantly lowers tax rates and will
greatly increase private production incentives, he said.
    "Our estimates at the Council of Economic Advisers suggest
national net output of goods and services will permanently
increase by approximately two pct because of the long-run
consequences of tax reform," Sprinkel said. "In 1986, this would
have amounted to an increase of approximately 600 dlrs in the
income of the average American family."
    Sprinkel also argued the 1981 tax cuts were not responsible
for the large increase in the budget deficit.
    In fiscal 1986 ending September, federal spending amounted
to 23.8 pct of GNP, while federal receipts absorbed 18.5 pct of
GNP, leaving a deficit of 5.3 pct, he said.
    Sprinkel said that, compared with fiscal 1978, the 1986
federal expenditure share of GNP is 2.7 percentage points
higher and the revenue share of GNP is virtually the same.
    "Contrary to the conventional wisdom, therefore, the 1981
tax cut is not the root cause of the extraordinary budget
deficits of the past few years," Sprinkel said.
    "This tax cut merely rolled back the inflation-induced tax
increases that occurred between 1978 and 1981," he added.
    However, the Congressional Budget Office's Rudolph Penner
argued that the tax cut in 1981 was misguided.
    "Since making the big mistake in 1981 of cutting taxes
enormously without any plan to decrease spending by the
Administration or Congress, indeed with increases in defence
spending, now all the options (for reducing the budget deficit)
are unpleasant," he said.
    Penner said the tax cut resulted from the ideological
turmoil in the U.S. Caused by the "biggest sustained inflation
in our nation's history," which helped foster widespread
distrust of government.
    "The American people turned on the government with tax
revolt at the state level and new demands on the government at
the national level," Penner said.
    "But their dislike of taxes exceeded their general dislike
of spending programs. Now the correction of that 1981 mistake
demands that the system change a lot."
    Penner sees little hope the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget
deficit reduction targets will be met and said the deficit will
remain at roughly 200 billion dlrs this year.
    He said a budget process that sets targets arbitrarily is
not likely to succeed.
    "I feel pretty safe in saying that any process that tries to
dictate a numerical outcome from above is doomed to fail simply
because there's no ... Way to enforce it," Penner said.
    Penner questioned the methods by which the 1987 budget
deficit was cut. He said 18 to 19 billion dlrs were eliminated
by one-time measures, such as a temporary increase in taxes
related to tax reform and sales of government assets.
    "Another four billion dlrs was cut by what I call creative
timing changes, like moving the military payday from the last
day of fiscal 1987 to the first day of fiscal 1988. That saved
more than two billion dlrs," Penner said.

The U.S. Producer Price Index for
finished goods rose 0.1 pct on a seasonally adjusted basis in
February, the Labor Department said.
    The increase came after a 0.6 pct increase in producer
prices in January.
    Higher energy prices were primarily responsible for the
increase in February, though they rose at a slower pace than
they had in January, the department said.
    The finished goods index was up 0.1 pct from its February,
1986 level.
    Before seasonal adjustment, the index for finished goods
stood at 292.3 over its 1967 base of 100.
    Among finished goods, the index for energy products rose
four pct in February after a 9.8 pct increase in January. But
price increases slowed sharply for gasoline and home heating
oil, the department said.
    There were some price declines, including a 3.4 pct fall
for passenger cars and 1.3 pct for light trucks from January
levels. This reflected expanded factory-financed rebates and
discount loan programs, the department said.

    The index for consumer foods fell 0.5 pct after a 1.8
pct drop in January as vegetables, pork and coffee cost less.
The index for intermediate goods rose 0.5 pct following a sharp
0.9 pct rise in January.
    The department said that energy prices again were the main
reason, with the index for intermediate energy up 2.7 pct.
    Gasoline and diesel fuel prices were about five pct higher,
half the 10 pct jump recorded in January.
    The durable manufacturing materials index edged down 0.1
pct last month after jumping 1.0 pct in January as prices for
steel, precious metals and copper stabilized.
    The department said lead and zinc prices fell, while
hardwood lumber and cement cost more. The crude materials index
rose 1.8 pct in February after a 2.9 pct rise in January. Crude
energy materials were up 2.6 pct, much less than the 10 pct
rise in January. Crude petroleum prices rose 4.4 pct last month
after a sharp 19.7 pct rise in January.
    Price rises accellerated for logs and timber and tobacco,
but fell for cotton, metal ores and copper and aluminum scrap.
    Among finished goods, gasoline rose 5.5 pct after a 15.7
pct January increase, and fuel oil was up three pct in February
after an 18.0 pct increase in January.

Japanese securities houses have asked the

    Finance Ministry officials declined comment but said the
Ministry has been aware of growing calls from securities houses
for 10-year bond auctions.
    Japanese securities houses also may allow foreign brokers
to underwrite more 10-year bonds from April. Four U.S. Banks
are expected to receive Finance Ministry approval in late April
to operate securities subsidiaries in Japan as long as they
hold no more than 50 pct of the capital, bankers said.
    These firms are likely to join the syndicate, which will
increase the number of participants in the 10-year government
bond primary market, securities managers said.
    Each of the 17 current foreign securities houses in the
syndicate underwrites 0.07 pct of each issue, they said.
    In order to expand participation by foreigners, the
syndicate must either expand the securities industry's 26 pct

Volkswagen AG <VOWG.F> said it has
dismissed the head of its foreign exchange department and
suspended several other staff members following the recent
emergence of a possible currency fraud at the company.
    A VW statement said foreign exchange department chief
Burkhard Junger had been dismissed with immediate effect.
    It said it has also suspended Guenther Borchert, head of
the financial transfer department, and Siegfried Mueller, head
of the central cash and currency clearing department. Four
other members of the foreign exchange staff were also
suspended.
    VW said the possibly fraudulent foreign currency
transactions, which could cost the company 480 mln marks, fell
directly within the area of responsibility of Borchert and
Mueller.
    VW said Adalbert Sedlmair, formerly finance director at
VW's former office equipment subsidiary Triumph-Adler AG, would
temporarily take over responsibility of the financial transfer
department during Borchert's suspension from duties.
    Meanwhile, the state prosecutor's office in Brunswick,
which is looking into the currency transactions, said the
Federal Criminal Office in Wiesbaden had also joined the
investigation and would be responsible for measures such as
possible police searches.
    A spokeswoman for the office said prosecutors in Frankfurt
were looking into the possibility of taking over the VW case
but added a final decision would be taken next week.
    The short VW statement said, "Burkhard Junger, 39, who had
already been suspended from his duties in January, has been
dismissed with immediate effect."
    Company sources said Borchert and Mueller were not thought
to have been directly involved with the currency transactions
but they may have been lax in their supervision.

Applied Biosystems Inc said
it has lowered its internal product sales forecast following a

    The company also said Chairman Sam Eletr has resigned for
personal reasons.
    The company said it now expects third quarter, ending March
31, sales to approximate the second quarter's 21.1 mln dlrs and
third quarter earnings to be less than the second quarter's 2.7
mln dlrs, or 20 cts a share, due to unexpected European
softness and previously announced new product delays.
    Applied Biosystems earned 2,654,000 dlrs, or 20 cts a
share, in 1986's third quarter on sales of 13.4 mln dlrs.
    Explaining European orders have not materialized at the
rate expectd, the company added "we believe that the slowness
in orders reflects current conditions in the market for
research instrumentation in Europe."
    It said sales in the current quarter are also being
affected by the previously announced delay in completion of the
software for the Model 900A Data Analysis Module. The
unavialability of that product also impacts sales of the
associated model 420A Derivatizer system.
    Applied Biosystems said it presently expects this software
will be completed during the fourth quarter, but the resulting
lack of demonstration units in the field may postpone some
sales.
    Due to the delays and European uncertainties, "we must now
view the coming quarters with caution," it said, adding "some
earnings pressure is anticipated during the remainder of this
fiscal year."

U.S. industrial production rose 0.5
pct in February after a revised 0.1 pct increase in January,
the Federal Reserve Board said.
    The Fed previously said industrial production rose 0.4 pct
in January.
    The Fed said the February gain was dominated by a sharp
rise in motor vehicle production, which boosted output of both
consumer goods and business equipment. Industrial production
stood at 127.3 pct of the 1977 average in February and was up
1.7 pct from a year ago, the Fed said.
    The Fed also revised the December industrial production
figure to a gain of 0.5 pct from 0.3 pct originally reported.
    Manufacturing output rose 0.5 pct in February after a 0.1
pct increase in January and included gains of 0.8 pct in
durables and 0.1 pct in non-durables, the Fed said.
    Manufacturing was 2.4 pct above the year ago level.
    Production of auto assemblies rose to an annual rate of 8.3
mln units last month from a January rate of 7.5 mln units.
    Output of consumer goods rose 0.6 pct after falling 0.3 pct
in January and output of consumer durables was up 2.1 pct in
February after falling by 2.0 pct in January.
    Business equipment production rose 1.0 pct in February,
reflecting more output of autos and trucks for business use and
a recovery from strikes in farm equipment industries, the Fed
said.
    Mining output rose 0.1 pct after a 1.6 pct increase in
January, but was still six pct lower than a year ago.
    Utilities output rose 0.7 pct in February after a 1.2 pct
rise in January.
    Output of defense and space equipment was up 0.4 pct, the
same as in January, and 6.2 pct higher than a year ago.
    Output of construction supplies rose 0.2 pct in February
after a 1.5 pct January rise.
    Materials output increased by 0.2 pct last month, the
fourth consecutive monthly increase after declining throughout
much of 1986. The recent strength in materials has been
concentrated in textiles, paper and chemicals, the Fed said.
    Output of home goods was up 0.3 pct in February and the Fed

    Caesars said Sosnoff's offer to by all its outstanding

interests of its shareholders.
    The company recommended that shareholders reject Sosnoff's
offer, made through his <MTS Acquisition Corp>, and not tender

transactions but did not elaborate.
    Caesars, in a brief statement, did not say whether it would

    Sosnoff also informed the SEC that Caesars had offered to
buyout his holdings several times during the past year.

    Caesars said its financial advisor, Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc, had determined that Sosnoff's offer was financially
inadequate for shareholders other than Sosnoff.

the offer were its financial condition, future prospects,
current market conditions and the numerous conditions on which
Sosnoff's bid was conditioned.

The Chicago Mercantile Exchange's (CME)
board of directors issued a letter to its members that sets
limits, but does not ban, dual trading in the S and P 500
futures and options pit.
    The rules prohibit brokers who execute customer orders to 
trade for their own account, or engage in dual trading, from
the top step of the pit -- which the board defines as a
geographically advantageous position in the pit.
    Brokers who engage in dual trading in other areas of the
pit must record to the nearest minute those personal trades.
    The board will also set as yet unspecified percentage
limits on the trades brokers can conduct among "broker groups,"
otherwise known as "trading rings."
    By issuing its own rules, the CME's board rejected a
petition presented in February by some CME members that sought
to prohibit dual trading of any kind in the S and P 500 pits.
    The full CME membership will vote on the petition, since it
was rejected by the board, by April 13. If the members reject
the petition, the board would be free to implement its rules, a
CME spokesman said. However, the members can vote to adopt the
petition and institute a total ban on dual trading.
    The board's rules on dual trading, if implemented, would
prohibit brokers from trading for their own account once they
have executed a customer order from the top step of the pit.
    "It's a step in the right direction," said stock futures
analysts William Marcus of Donaldson, Lufkin, Jenrette Inc.
    "It's very difficult to engage in large broker business
from anywhere but the top step," he said.
    "If there were abuses, (the rules) should act to curb
them," Marcus added.
    The spokesman for the CME said the tenor of the board of
directors' letter to members appears to leave open the
possibility of additional limits on dual trading. In addition,
the limits set forth so far will have to be more closely
defined.

General Mills Inc, reporting
stronger results for the third quarter ended February 22, said
it expects the momentum to continue in the fourth quarter.
    The company said it expects to report "strong earnings per
share growth and a record return on equity in fiscal 1987." It
said this should be achieved despite expected non-operating
charges in the final quarter.
    General Mills said these charges will likely offset
non-operating gains, which included six cts a share in the
first half.
    General Mills said at the end of the third quarter, its
return on average equity was 31.6 pct.
    It said major factors contributing to the third quarter
improvement were an 11 pct gain in unit volume by Consumer
Foods, continuing good profit growth at Red Lobster USA and
strong performance in Specialty Retailing.
    The company reported quarterly earnings of 56.9 mln dlrs,

    Also downgraded were Beneficial's shelf registrations of

Proposals for a secondary market for
the resale of farm real estate loans similar to home mortgage
markets is gaining support in Congress and among rural lenders
and could be established this year, Congressional and financial
sources said.
    Several bills which would establish a farm secondary market
have been introduced in both the House and Senate. Furthermore,
Representatives of the Farm Credit System, commercial bankers
and life insurance companies are meeting in an attempt to agree
on a method of establishing the market.
    Frank Naylor, chairman of the Farm Credit Administration
(FCA), which regulates the farm credit system, yesterday said a
farm loan secondary market would be positive for agriculture
"as long as the farm credit system is a key player."
    Naylor told a House Agriculture subcommittee hearing the
secondary market could be established either with Congressional
legislation or administratively.
    Any farm loan secondary market would be modeled after the
successful resale markets in home mortgages, the Government
National Mortgage Association (GNMA) and the Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), industry sources said.
    Commercial banks and life insurance companies are the main
supporters of a farm loan secondary market because they believe
it would allow private lenders to compete more effectively in
rural lending with the quasi-government farm credit system,
traditionally the largest lender to farmers.
    A farm secondary market would allow lenders to sell
high-quality loans on farmland to "poolers" who in turn would
package the loans and issue farm mortgage-backed securities for
resale to investors-- called Aggie-mae by some supporters.
    However, the FCA and financially-troubled farm credit
system have in the past been ambivalent about the idea.
    The ambivalence is because any farm secondary market
established in the private sector that excluded the farm credit
system would put the system at a competitive disadvantage. That
could be a financial blow to the system, which has lost 4.6
billion dlrs in two years, Naylor and farm credit system
officials have said.
    A study commissioned by one of the main supporters of the
secondary market idea, the American Council of Life Insurers,
concludes the farm credit system's market share in rural
lending would fall if a secondary market were established. The
study was released earlier today.

Salomon Inc has lowered its investment
ratings on all U.S. money center banks, institutional sources
said.
    The sources said Salomon believes that other money center
banks may feel compelled to follow Citicorp's <CCI> lead
in its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission
relating to its loan exposure to Brazil.
    They also said Salomon believes that other banks may
strongly consider the possibility of placing Brazilian loans on
a non-accruing status with the consequent negative impact on
earnings.
    The sources said the ratings were lowered to M from O-plus.
The stock are now expected to match the Standard and Poor's 500
Index, rather than outperform the index as previously expected.
    The sources said it is also understood that the change in
the coding of these stocks should definitely not be taken as a
sell-recommendation because Salomon is said to believe that its
downgrading will only prove temporary.
    The banks affected by the change in investment coding are
Bank of New York Co Inc <BK>, Bankers Trust Co <BT>, Chase
Manhattan Corp <CMB>, Chemical New York Corp <CHL>, Citicorp
<CCI>, Irving Bank Corp <V>, Manufacturers Hanover Corp <MHC>,
J.P. Morgan and Co Inc <JPM>, Marine Midland Banks Inc <MM>,
Republic New York Corp <RNB>, Bank of Boston Corp <BKB> and
First Chicago Corp <FNB>.
    The institutional sources said that Thomas Hanley, a
director of Salomon Inc subsidiary Salomon Brothers who is in
charge of bank stock research, believes Citicorp's move is
well-timed.
    Should Citicorp actually place the Brazilian loans in a
non-performing category at the end of this quarter this action
would serve to alleviate the urgency associated with the debt
negotiations, he argues.
    Thus Citicorp's bargaining position would appear to have
been much enhanced.

Today's panic in the floating rate note
market has been simmering for months and is, in many ways, of
the market makers' own doing, traders and bank officials said.
    "For the last six months, there have been a series of crises
in the FRN market. Each has cut deeper and deeper into the very
fibre of the market," said a senior official at a U.S. Bank.
    As prices have fallen, he explained, the underwriters who
originally brought the issues have retreated. They have
divested themselves of the paper as quickly as possible,
unwilling to bear losses of the magnitude seen in recent panic
trading.
    In the virtual effective closure of the market for
perpetual floaters last month, bankers witnessed the
consequences of this kind of contraction of liquidity and
investor confidence.
    Fears were engendered about the possibility of this crisis
infecting the market in conventional dated FRN issues, which is
almost 10 times as large as that for perpetuals, with an
estimated 130 billion dlrs of debt outstanding.
    "The professionals are so nervous about holding inventory
that they will sell at any price," said an official at a leading
U.S. Bank, explaining the panic selling which has pushed prices
down sharply over the last two days.
    Bankers and FRN traders emphasised that today's trading was
unique in that it was driven exclusively by professionals and
that there was nothing fundamentally wrong with the securities
they sold.
    In highlighting this point, dealers noted that the
benchmark issues in the FRN market -- the two FRN's for the
U.K., Launched in 1985 and 1986 -- fell an unprecedented 50 and
40 basis points, respectively, at the opening this morning.
    Certainly, dealers said, Britain is no less credit-worthy
today than it was yesterday and the country's economic health
currently appears better than it has for some time.
    Pointing out that this kind of sovereign and supra-national
debt had not sagged on any fundamental weakness, one senior FRN
source said: "The idiocy of the situation is aptly shown by the
fact that these kind of borrowers can now tap the syndicated
loan markets at rates lower than their floaters currently pay."
    Dealers agreed that banking sector paper, which constitutes
a significant part of the market, was currently under pressure.
    Floating rate debt of major U.S. And Canadian banks eased
markedly in nervous trading last month on renewed investor
fears about the banks' exposure to Latin American debt.
    The U.S. And Canadian money centre bank FRNs, along with
Republic of Ireland paper, were hard hit again this week with
dealers citing one heavily-traded Citicorp note falling to
levels so low it is now effectively yielding 55 basis points
over Libor (the London Interbank Offered Rate).
    By comparison, the 500 mln dlr note which matures in 1998
yielded only a fine 20 basis point over Libid (the London
Interbank Bid Rate) when it was issued in January last year.
    Price declines of this size can really only be explained by
an understanding of the operating practices of leading players
in the market, dealers and banking analysts said.
    "This has to be understood as a matter between banks who
have a brief to buy low and sell high," one U.S. Bank source
noted.
    Another senior source at a U.K. Bank drew attention to the
enormous overhead costs and high salaries generated over the
last few years in the FRN market, which have to be justified.
    But even beyond the cost of running an FRN trading desk,
dealers said, is the way the securities are bought and sold.
    Although sophisticated on-screen dealing exists in most
markets, in the euro-markets trading is conducted by telephone.
    "If somebody calls you up and asks you to make him a price
in any issue, and you do, he can say "Right. You own five mln',"
a trader said, explaining market practice.
    The unfortunate buyer is then forced to unload the
securities just minutes later to yet another firm at an even
lower price, the trader explained.
    It is precisely this phenomenon that forced the rapid
downward price spiral earlier today, traders said, adding that
it is likely to continue until the markets either regain their
confidence or market practices change.
    One possible solution, dealers said, would be to initiate
trading exclusively through brokers' screens, so that only
those who wanted to buy bonds would have to "lift a bid" or buy
at that price.
    Meanwhile, bank regulators are apparently concerned about
the implications of the collapse in FRN prices.
    Traders in London said that the Bank of England has called
around to market makers asking whether they intended to
continue trading and what they calculated the losses to be.
    The Bank often makes periodic checks in the market, but
dealers said the latest enquiries were more specific.
    A spokesman for the Bank of England was not able to comment
immediately on the Bank's action.
    One trader at a major U.S. Bank here said that in addition,
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's international capital
markets unit has phoned banks in London today seeking
information about trading in FRN's. He also said that this was
not an unusual procedure.

The New York Stock Exchange said it
and its New York Futures Exchange affiliate will move the
expiration of their respective index options and index futures
contracts to the opening of trading in the underlying stock on
each expiration Friday from the close of trading.
    The exchange said it has submitted the changes to the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission for approval.
    The exchange said, "The NYSE has long advocated settlement
in the morning rather than at the close of trading as a
practical way to deal with order imbalances and price
volatility which historically occur on so-called "triple
witching days."
    The triple witching hour falls four times a year when
individual stock options, stock index futures and options on
stock indexes all expire on the third Friday of the month,
which has led to volatile last-hour market swings.
    On the last triple witching Friday, December 19, the NYSE
traded almost 85 mln shares at the close of the market. The
next triple witching hour will take place Friday, March 20.
    The exchange said, "Morning settlement would expose order
imbalances to the full sunlight of public disclosure, ensure
the broadest dissemination of market information, and
facilitate the participation of all interested investors."

The Reagan Administration's soon-to-be
published proposals to make experimental therapies more rapidly
and widely available to terminally ill patients pose product
liability problems for drug companies, experts in the
pharmaceutical field said.
    Details of the proposals will be published in the Federal
Register shortly and will become effective after a 90-day
comment period.
    Under the proposed policy, announced Tuesday by
Commissioner of Food and Drugs Frank E. Young at a press
conference, patients with life threatening diseases who are not
enrolled in clinical trials would be allowed access to an
experimental therapy. The policy also allows drug companies to
sell the promising drugs to patients.
    Previously drugs like AZT could be rushed into wider use
free-of-charge if the agent was shown to be effective. Under
the new policy, the FDA could only refuse to permit a physician
to administer an experimental drug if it was shown to be
unsafe.
    Financial analysts said the plan would likely benefit
biotechnology companies with few or no products approved for
marketing in the U.S., but would have little economic impact on
large drug companies with many other sources of revenue.
    "Charging a fee for still experimental drugs could help
biotech companies' near-term financial situation and help make
them less dependent on outside sources," said Teena Lerner, a
biotech analyst at L.F. Rothchild.
    Other observers were concerned that drug companies would be
put into a legal bind if promising drugs later proved to have
devastating side effects.
    "Before a lot of drug companies release these drugs they
are going to have to think long and hard about liability--the
product liability problems are enormous," said a
Washington-based lawyer who specializes in the drug field.
    Patients in clinical trials normally sign lengthy informed
consent papers before taking an investigational drug. The
lawyer said no more than two cases had gone to trial for suits
against a drug company's investigational drug.
    "The new proposals are a whole new kettle of fish," said
the lawyer. "Drug companies are right now probably meeting with
their insurance companies."
    Burroughs-Wellcome Co, the U.S. arm of the British firm
Wellcome PLC that makes AZT, Merck and Co Inc <MRK>,
Hoffman-LaRoche Inc and SmithKline Beckman Corp <SKB> said it
was too soon to comment on the policy.
    "I'm very uncomforable with this," said Wellcome
spokeswoman Kathy Bartlett. "We haven't had a chance to
formulate a response yet. It's too early."
    But some financial analysts say the proposals would benefit
drug companies.
    "I find the proposal to be a very significant alteration of
the FDA's past policies that should positively affect (drug
companies') stocks," said drug analyst Davis Saks, with Morgan,
Olmstead, Kennedy and Gardner.
    Saks also warned that many health care providers would balk
at the proposal, and would call it "amoral" to charge patients
with life-threatening diseases for drugs that otherwise would
be given out for free in clinical trials.
    Jeffrey Warren, spokesman for the Pharmaceutical
Manufacturers Association, which represents the major drug
firms in the U.S., said "A mechanism already exists at the FDA
permitting certain seriously ill patients access to
experimental drugs and perhaps that system can be approved."
    Warren acknowledged that the PMA may not be able to come up
with a consensus among its membership when the rules are
formally published.
    He also admitted that product liability problems could be a
concern to major drug companies.
    Jeffrey Levi, executive director of the National Gay and
Lesbian Task Force, which is actively in AIDS policy and
funding issues, cited the drug Suramin from Bayer AG <BAYRY>,
which had shown early promise as an AIDS treatment, but on
wider clinical testing was shown to have deadly side effects.

West German banking authorities are
considering requiring German banks to bring securities holdings
into lending ratio calculations used to regulate credit risk,
banking sources said.
    The present interpretation of the credit law limits banks'
maximum lending to 18 times eligible capital -- reserves plus
equity capital -- but sets no restraints on securities
holdings.
    Under new provisions, weightings would be attached to
securities similar to those used for lending. Weightings would
range from a zero rating for no-risk assets to 100 pct of total
asset value for what authorities consider the highest risk.
    Low-risk securities carrying a zero rating would include
public authority bonds for the federal government, states and
municipalities, the sources said.
    A 20 pct rating would be assigned to issues of domestic
banks. Secured bonds of mortgage, shipping and public authority
banks would be an exception to this, via such securities as
mortgage and municipal bonds.
    Securities issued by foreign banks would attract a
weighting of 50 pct, while authorities are considering
requiring banks to include 100 pct of the value of debt assets
of foreign issuers, including sovereign borrowers.
    The sources said the revision is still being discussed, and
required approval by the federal Banking Supervisory Office in
West Berlin, the Bundesbank, and West Germany's four banking
associations.
    The move is a response to the increasing securitisation of
debt markets, they added.

Dome Petroleum Ltd's revised debt
restructuring plan keeps the company alive and improves its
appeal as a takeover target, but full debt repayment depends on
a sharp oil price rise, oil and banking analysts said.
    Dome's complex proposal to let creditors link some or all
of their debt to oil-indexed debentures or convert it to equity
is "very cut and dried and to the point," Peters and Co Ltd
Calgary-based energy analyst Wilf Gobert said.
    Dome "is saying, This is the way it is. There isn't enough
money to pay you back,'" he added.
    The plan "strikes me as a very pragmatic thing to do,"
First Marathon Securities Ltd oil analyst Jim Doak commented.
    He said the plan seeks to formally tie payments to
creditors with the price of oil, which governs Dome's cash flow
and ability to service its debt.
    Dome expects its total debt to reach 6.4 billion Canadian
dlrs by June 30, 1987, when an interim debt rescheduling plan
expires and Dome hopes to implement the long term plan.
    Gobert said the plan would rank secured and unsecured
creditors in a complex series of repayment categories or "an
agreed pecking order of what your (creditors) claim to assets
is."
    Potential suitors would find Dome easier to swallow under
the debt restructuring plan because it proposes to resolve
competing claims on assets pledged to secured creditors and on
remaining unpledged assets, Gobert and others said.
    "Certainly the restructuring plan, once it's agreed to and
put in place, is going to make it easier for someone to come in
and look at doing a deal on it (acquiring the company)," Gobert
remarked.
    "It's going to be a lot easier than it is right now because
you'll have settled the pecking order question," he added.
    Gobert believes the debt plan may be partly motivated by a
desire to sell Dome Petroleum as a whole.
    "If the creditors wanted to liquidate their bank loans they
could do it in an orderly fashion through the sale of the
company, as opposed to dismemberment," he said.
    Dome's proposal includes rescheduling secured debt payments
over a 15 to 20 year schedule, linking payments to cash flows
generated by assets pledged against loans and establishing
interest rates that allow for changing oil prices.
    Creditors' only real alternative to Dome's plan is "an
asset grab which would liquidate the company at distress
prices, and the banks would spend the next 20 years in court
deciding who had what asset," First Marathon's Doak said.
    For Dome's creditors, the plan does not offer a quick
method to recover loans, but extends payment time in the hope
that oil prices will rise, increasing the amount of the
company's debt payments, Merrill Lynch Canada Inc bank analyst
Terry Shaunessy said.
    The plan "is not a solution. It says give me more time and
let's keep our fingers crossed that oil goes way up."
    Doak and Shaunessy estimated oil prices would have to rise
to about 28 to 30 U.S. dlrs a barrel to fully service all of
the company's debt.
    Analysts said the plan would ensure the company continues
to operate, but provides little other benefit to common
shareholders.
    "From a common shareholder standpoint, all this does is
sort of keep him on the life support system, because there
isn't any equity unless you get a big increase in oil prices,"
Gobert remarked.
    Analysts said Dome's common shares, trading today at 1.12
dlrs, off four cents, on the Toronto Stock Exchange,
essentially represent a long term warrant pegged to oil prices.
    "You have to be looking at an extremely high price of oil
in the context of historical trends before there's any residual
value for the common shareholders," analyst Doak said.
    While Dome's plan said lenders will be able to convert debt
to common shares, the amount of dilution depends on share
conversion prices still to be negotiated and how much lenders
would choose to convert, the company said.

Congressional budget leaders are
asking President Reagan to join in a bipartisan effort - or
even a summit - to write a new budget, but White House chief of
staff Howard Baker said no decision has been made yet, a Senate
source said.
    The request for White House cooperation was made yesterday
by Senate Budget Committee chairman Lawton Chiles at a meeting
with Baker, the source said.
    The appeal came as the Senate Budget Committee made plans
to start drafting next Tuesday a fiscal 1988 budget plan that
Democrats controlling Congress hope to get through both
chambers by April 15.
    House Democrats have been meeting privately and will
continue discussions on Tuesday to develop a plan for the full
committee which holds its first drafting meeting Thursday.
    Reagan's own budget was submitted in January but Congress
generally has rejected it as unrealistic, with the
Congressional Budget Office saying the deficit is understated
and should be a more realistic 134 billion dlrs.   
    Among major controversial decisions that Congress has to
make are levels of deficit deductions to meet the Gramm-Rudman
budget law target of cutting the estimated 171
billion dlr deficit for 1988 to 108 billion dlrs.
    A key decisions is the amount of new revenues - Reagan
proposed some 22 billion dlrs in asset sales and excise taxes -
as part of a deficit cutting plan.
    Reagan, who opposes new taxes, refuses to say he is
advocating higher taxes through his revenue scheme.
    The Gramm-Rudman law sets fixed deficit targets for
Congress with the aim of wiping out huge deficits by 1991, but
over the past two years deficits have exceeded the targets.
    The Senate source said that Chiles asked for cooperation to
avoid clashes when the Senate and House Budget committees start
writing separate budget plans for congressional approval,
starting next week.
    The source said Chiles told Baker "If you start working
sooner, rather than later you have a chance to do something
before everyone gets locked in."
    Baker has had conversations about the budget problem with
Senator Pete Domenici of New Mexico, the senior Republican on
the Senate Budget Committee, and with House Speaker Jim Wright.
    Baker reportedly said that he plans to have further talks
with other Republicans and House Budget Committee Chairman
William Gray "before the the White House decides what it is
going to do, if anything," the source said.
    House sources said that Gray --who has been pushing the
idea of a budget summit with Reagan--is anxious to work with
the White House to get a compromise budget plan.
    Besides reaching decisions on actual spending and revenue
levels in a new budget, congressmen are considering adjusting
or redefining the targets of the Gramm-Rudman law to make them
more realistic.
    Reagan presented about 36 billion dlrs in spending delays,
cuts and revenues he said will reach 108 billion dlrs.
    Gray has said that if Congress approves 36 billion dlrs in
reductions, the deficit would be 134 billion dlrs realistically
because of what he says are more accurate economic assumptions.

Midland Bank Plc <MDBL.L> said its
Greenwell Montagu Securities unit would pull out of equity
market making and concentrate instead on providing a broker
dealer and agency service for its clients.
    The operation has become the first major casualty in the
London markets since deregulation last October abolished fixed
commissions and allowed the merging of broking and jobbing
operations into market making activities.
    A spokesman said Greenwell Montagu Gilt Edged, which is a
primary gilt edged market maker, and Greenwell Montagu
stockbrokers, were not affected by the decision.
    The market making operation had encountered much greater
competition than had been expected in the post-Big Bang period,
the spokesman added.
    Although Midland considered that the operation would be
viable in the long term, it would require the concentration of
greater resources than could be justified for an operation that
was not a core Midland activity. He confirmed Greenwell Montagu
Securities had been losing money in past months.
    The pull out from market making would be conducted in an
orderly fashion in the near future. There might also be some
job losses, he said without giving any details.
    Market sources said it was no great surprise that a market
maker had pulled out, as the intensity of competition had
suggested for some time that sooner or later someone would
decide to withdraw.
    They said some retreat by Greenwell had been likely because
of its losses, and added there also been speculation that it
could pull out of market making in gilts also.
    The move was unlikely to have any major impact on market
confidence, as the occasional speculation in the past few weeks
had had little impact.
    Analysts said commission rates on institutional equity
trades have dropped sharply in the five months since
deregulation, with some firms covering some of their reduced
profits by trading on their own account.
    In a recent report, Greenwell Montagu Research said, "Those
who have made profits are either immensely clever or immensely
lucky. Some are already approaching the pain barrier, others
are prepared to tough it out. But until some players withdraw
from the market, it will be difficult to improve profitability."
    Dealers said the pace of withdrawals was likely to speed up
in the next year, and would intensify if the three-month bull
run on the London stock exchange petered out.

Grain traders and analysts look for a
10 to 12 mln acre sign-up in the USDA's conservation reserve
program, scheduled to be announced after 1400 CST today.
    The USDA probably will accept about 80 to 90 pct of the
acres submitted, they said.
    Total enrollment in the first three years of the program is
only 8.9 mln acres, so the sharp increase expected this year
has underpinned new crop corn futures all week.
    However, some analysts said a 10 to 12 mln acre sign-up may
end up being negative to new crop corn prices, citing trade
talk earlier this year that 14 to 15 mln acres may be submitted
by farmers. Also, acres set-aside under the conservation
program are by definition poor yielding, so the impact on total
corn production will be minimal, they added.

Mobil Corp made a 15 pct reduction in
its long term debt in 1986 from the previous year according to
data in its 1986 annual report.
    Mobil chairman, Allen E. Murray said in his report to
shareholders, "that lower debt and our strong cash and
marketable securities position improves Mobil's flexibility."
    Long term debt as of December 31, 1986 was put at 7.9
billion dlrs, down 15 pct from 9.3 billion dlrs on the same day
in 1985.
    Mobil has moved to reduce debt at high interest rates,
which may reduce interest payments.
    Murray said that with the results from 1986, "we're paying
back 3.8 billion dlrs in the past two years, or the equivalent
of 66 pct of the debt incurred in 1984 when we bought Superior
Oil."
    Mobil said that it has about 183 mln dlrs of long term debt
which is due in 1987 although this will rise appreciably to 1.2
billion dlrs of long term debt due in 1988.
    At the end of 1986, Mobil said it also had an existing
effective shelf registration with the Securities and Exchange
Commmission to permit the sale of 205 mln dlrs of debt.
   Mobil's debt reduction program has also been abetted by
several steps taken by the company to restructure its
operations.
    Mobil's Murray said in his remarks to shareholders that the
company was continuing to dispose of assets which did not fit
the company's long range plans and had realized some 1.1
billion dlrs from the sale of its Container Corp subsidiary.
    Murray said that as a result of lower debt and more
efficient operations "the company is now is a position to seize
opportunities that may become available and use this strength
in whatever way best builds shareholder value."

U.S. February reports reflecting slim
gains in industrial output and moderating inflation pressures
reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve will continue
to follow a stable course of monetary policy, economists said.
    "If you're the Fed, there's no reason to do anything," said
Steve Slifer of Lehman Government Securities Inc.
    "There are hints that GNP is picking up. On the inflation
front, all is well," he said. "Money supply is well under
control. It's an absolutely ideal situation."
    February U.S. industrial production rose 0.5 pct, slightly
less than the 0.7 pct gain the financial markets had expected.
This compared with a slim 0.1 pct rise in January's production
number, previously reported as a 0.4 pct increase.
    The February U.S. producer price index gained only 0.1 pct,
less than a 0.3-0.4 pct expected rise. This followed a 0.6 pct
rise in the PPI in January.
    "The Fed is going to look at this positively," said Allan
Leslie of Discount Corporation. "Certainly inflation is not as
bad as what Volcker (Fed Chairman) has said lately. Industrial
production growth is along the lines of what the Fed wants."
    The energy products component of PPI rose 4.0 pct in
February, after a 9.8 pct increase in January.
    "This shows that the impact of energy prices on inflation
is behind us in terms of the move from 15 dlrs to 18 dlrs per
barrel," said Maria Ramirez of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. "The
trend is still 3.5 pct in the first half of the year."
    In 1986, declining energy prices contributed to a 2.5 pct
decline in the PPI.
    Economists said that a rise in energy prices was expected,
but a sharp drop in auto prices was not. Passenger car prices
fell 3.4 pct and light truck prices dropped 1.3 pct.
    Yesterday, Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker said that
a possibility of renewed inflation remains a concern in both
the financial markets and the Federal Reserve.
    "The Fed may be lowering its own inflation expectations
today," said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities International.
    While low inflation permits the Fed to maintain an easier
monetary policy, Brusca said if import prices do not rise this
could necessitate a weaker dollar.
    "The outlook for the dollar is still up in the air," he
said. "We need inflation for U.S. producers to compete with
foreign producers."
    Brusca said prices of electronic equipment dropped 0.8 pct
in February's PPI. With many electronic goods produced
overseas, this may show that foreign producers are not raising
prices which bodes ill for U.S. competitiveness, he said.
    If further dollar declines are needed, this could diminish
overseas investment in U.S. debt, Brusca added, which might
necessitate higher interest rates and lower bond prices.
    By contrast, Slifer said imported goods prices rose 11.8
pct from first quarter 1985 to first quarter 1986 reflecting to
a large degree a 22 pct drop in the trade-weighted real value
of the dollar from February 1985 to February 1987.
    Slifer said import prices may rise further as
manufacturers' contracts put in place before the dollar dropped
to current levels expire, and new contracts are made that
reflect a weaker dollar.
    David Wyss of Data Resources Inc noted that imported
manufactured goods prices rose 8.5 pct at an annual rate in the
second half of 1986, which has contributed to rising U.S.
industrial output.
    "It's the other side of the lower dollar," Wyss said.
"Producers are beginning to find themselves more competitive
and they are increasing output."
    Wyss said that the latest data point to an average
industrial production gain of 0.3-0.4 pct in the first quarter.
"It's an encouraging sign that the manufacturing sector is
beginning to revive."
    But Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley and Co Inc was not 
convinced that the February reports portend economic gains. He
said much of the strength came from factors that do not point
to a sustained rise in industrial output.
    Roach pointed out that stikers returning to work in farm
equipment industries helped account for a one pct rise in
February business equipment production.
    Utilities output rose 0.7 pct in February after gaining 1.2
pct in January, but Roach said it shows mostly that more energy
was produced, not that manufacturing activity gained.
    Finally, he pointed out that auto production accounted for
half of the industrial production gain as production of auto
assemblies rose to 8.3 million units at an annual rate from 7.5
million units.
    "In the first quarter, it looks like automakers are
producing at an 8.5 mln unit annual rate, but selling at
roughly a seven mln unit rate," Roach said. "The disparity
between output and sales is showing up in inventories."
    Economists pointed to sharp rise in January U.S. business
inventories as a sign that production may be outstripping
demand in the first quarter of 1987.
    January business inventories rose 0.9 pct, the largest gain
since July 1979 when inventories rose 1.7 pct, the Commerce
Department said. Business sales dropped 4.5 pct in January, the
largest monthly sales drop on record.
    Nonetheless, economists do not expect the Fed to react to
month-to-month changes. "The Fed has been standing pat for the
last seven months," Ramirez said. "They will continue to stand
pat for at least the next couple of months."

A secondary market for resale of
farm real estate loans similar to markets on home mortgages is
gaining support in Congress and among rural lenders and could
be set up this year, Congressional and financial sources said.
    Several bills which would establish a farm secondary market
have been introduced in both the House and Senate. Furthermore,
Representatives of the Farm Credit System, commercial bankers
and life insurance companies are meeting in an attempt to agree
on a method of establishing the market.
    Frank Naylor, chairman of the Farm Credit Administration,
FCA, which regulates the farm credit system, yesterday said a
farm loan secondary market would be positive for agriculture
"as long as the farm credit system is a key player."
    Naylor told a House Agriculture subcommittee hearing the
secondary market could be established either with Congressional
legislation or administratively.
    Any farm loan secondary market would be modeled after the
successful resale markets in home mortgages, the Government
National Mortgage Association, GNMA, and the Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), industry sources said.
    Commercial banks and life insurance companies are the main
supporters of a farm loan secondary market since they believe
it would allow private lenders to compete more effectively in
rural lending with the quasi-government farm credit system,
traditionally the largest lender to farmers.
    A farm secondary market would allow lenders to sell
high-quality loans on farmland to "poolers," who in turn would
package the loans and issue farm mortgage-backed securities for
resale to investors -- called Aggie-mae by some proponents.
    The FCA and financially-troubled farm credit system have in
the past been ambivalent about the idea, mainly because any
farm secondary market established in the private sector which
excluded the farm credit system would put the system at a
competitive disadvantage and could be another financial blow to
the system, which has lost 4.6 billion dlrs in two years,
Naylor and farm credit system officials have said.
    However, the system and FCA have become more positive to
the idea recently because the system could benefit if it were
appointed the agent for a secondary market.
    "If the farm credit system were the guarantor of the pools
of farm mortgage loans, it would benefit from the fees charged
for providing this service," the Life Insurers' study said.
    Congressional sources believe a secondary market available
to both private lenders and the farm credit system, with the
system as agent, could be included in a major federal
government rescue package for the system to be drafted by
Congress later this year.
    A study commissioned by one of the main supporters of the
secondary market idea, the American Council of Life Insurers,
concludes that the farm credit system's market share in rural
lending would fall if a secondary market were established.
    The study was released earlier today.
    The study said a secondary market could be established with
virtually no federal money if the government provided a
guarantee of 90 pct of the farm loans but a private
co-insurance plan guaranteed the first 10 pct of any losses.
    It estimated between 500 mln and two billion dlrs of the
eight billion in new farm real estate loans issued each year
would qualify for the secondary market in the first few years,
expanding significantly later as investors accept the idea.
    The study also said interest rates charged to farmers who
meet the underwriting standards of a secondary market would
fall 50 to 100 basis points due to the new resale market.
    The possible interest rate declines are a major reason why
leading U.S. farm organizations such as the American Farm
Bureau Federation have recently endorsed the idea.
    Proponents say a secondary market also would increase
liquidity in farm lending, and spread the risk of such loans.

Mobil Corp chairman Allen E. Murray
said in the annual report issued today that the company's total
1987 capital expenditures would be lower than the three
billion dlrs spent in 1986.
    "Overall capital and exploration expenditures will fall
slightly below the level for 1986 although we'll be ready to
increase spending whenever the outlook becomes more promising,"
Murray said.
    Mobil data in the annual report shows capital expenditures
have been cut every year since 1984's 3.6 billion dlrs to 3.5
billion dlrs in 1985.
    Murray told shareholders that despite the cuts "the company
has promising acreage to explore as well as major oil and gas
reserves to develop in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Africa and
Indonesia.
    Over the past two weeks Mobil has announced restructuring
of its domestic exploration and development organization and
this week a restructuring of its oil services units, which
support the new affiliate.
    "Mobil's chairman has explained this change by saying we
need a leaner organization to get more efficient usage from our
assets," said John Lord, a Mobil Corp spokesman.
    Murray said in announcing the first reorganization, which
will combine its current three exploration and producing
affiliates into one organization, Mobil Exploration and
Production U.S. Inc, that it is more effective than the present
organization and will improve the company's upstream
competitive position.
    Yesterday the company said that it will restructure its
Mobil Exploration and Producing Services Inc, MEPSI, to enhance
the development and transfer of technology supporting critical
areas of exploration, drilling, resevoir management and
computer systems.
    Earnings from Mobil's upstream operations in 1986 were 827
mln dlrs, down 54 pct from the previous year's 1.8 billion dlrs
in earnings.
    Mobil's strategy in the exploration and production sector
will be to give most attention to exploration possibilities
with the greatest long term potential, the company said.
    In its annual report, Mobil said that this will include
greater emphasis on "frontier plays that, although riskier, fit
our strengths of technology and size...This probably also means
a shift toward emphasis in the foreign area since selective
overseas exploration offers greater potential."

The U.S. Agriculture Department's
Export Enhancement Program, EEP, contributed to the recent
agreement to include farm subsidies in the new round of global
trade talks, according to the General Accounting Office.
    GAO Senior Associate Director Allan Mendelowitz told a
Senate Agriculture subcommittee that the EEP has increased the
cost of the European Community's Common Agricultural Policy.
    However, there is little reason to believe that once EEP
expires, gains in U.S. farm exports attributable to the program
will be sustained in targeted markets, he said.
    Mendelowitz said broadening the EEP by making it
across-the-board would eliminate charges of discrimination by
traditional buyers and increase pressure on the EC, but
antagonize non-subsidizing exporters.

    The higher price applies to cars produced by Chrysler at

Shipments of Chrysler cars from Kenosha began March nine.
    Chrysler in the past year transferred production of the

increase will cover the cost of moving the production line.

Fairchild Industries Inc said
it will close the Fairchild Republic plant at Farmingdale this
year, and sell it next year, after agreeing with the U.S. Air
Force to terminate the T-46A trainer aircraft program.
    John Sanford, the Fairchild Republic unit's president and
vice president of the corporation, said Reublic will fulfill
its remaining current obligations, but will cease work on the
T-46A immediately.
    Fairchild said the unit has already delivered two protoype
and one production T-46A.
    Sanford said lack of additional Air Force funding for the
trainer due to budget constraints prompted the termination
agreement.
    Sanford added that without the T-46A or business to replace
the work, Fairchild was forced to close the plant.
    Fairchild said it expects to retain about 200 engineers and
technicians at a small operation to be set up in 1987 on Long
Island to continue providing technical support for the Air
Force's A-10 aircraft.
    Fairchild added that its Fairchild Composites/Bonding
Center, formerly a part of the Fairchild Republic operation,
will become an independent operation.
    Paul Wright, Fairchild president and chief operating
officer, said, "With the settlement of the T-46A issue we have
put behind us the last of two problem aircraft programs that
caused the company heavy losses over the past two years."
    Wright added that the company can now move forward with its
restructuring to emphasize on growth areas in aerospace,
communications, electronics and its commercial and industrial
businesses.
    Earlier, Fairchild reported losses from continuing
operations in 1986's 4th qtr of 3.2 mln dlrs, or 44 cts a
share.
    This compares with a operating profit of two mln dlrs, or a
loss of eight cts a share, after subtracting the provisions for
preferred shares, in 1985's fourth quarter.
    Fairchild reported 1986 operating net of 7.6 mln dlrs, or a
loss of 34 cts a share, after provisions for preferred shares,
versus a loss of 283,000 dlrs, or 93 cts a share, in 1985.

the Conservation Reserve Program, USDA announced.
    In the latest signup, farmers on 101,020 farms submitted
bids on a total of 11,254,837 acres.
    The accepted bids for annual rental payments ranged up to
90 dlrs per acre with an average of 51.17 dlrs per acre.
    Land entered into the Conservation Reserve Program will be
ineligible for farming for ten years and must be planted with
permanent vegetative cover.
    Producers enrolled 1,894,764 acres of corn base acreage in
the conservation program to take advantage of a corn "bonus"
rental payment that was offered by USDA.
    The corn bonus, to be paid in generic comodity
certificates, amounts to two dlrs per bushel, based on the ASCS
program payment yield for corn, for each acre of corn based
accepted into the reserve.
    The state showing the biggest enrollment in the
conservation program during this signup was Texas with
approximately 1.225 mln acres, followed by Iowa with 1.030 mln
acres, Minnesota with 890,000 acres, Montana 875,000 acres, and
Kansas with 842,000 acres.

    Despite the lower car sales, the giant automaker had a
bright spot as its Chevrolet division, which is launching a
national sales campaign this month for its new Corsica and
Beretta compact cars, was up almost 21 pct when only
domestic-built cars were counted. GM's Buick division was also
up, by 11.4 pct, while Cadillac was down 7.8 pct, Pontiac was
off 10.8 pct and Oldsmobile plunged 41 pct.
    GM also showed an improvement in its market share to 53.6
pct from 48.1 pct in late February, which analysts said was
partly due to the increasing sales for the new Chevrolets.
    Meanwhile, Ford said its car sales rose 5.9 pct to 50,407
compared with 47,592 a year ago while truck sales gained by
12.6 pct to 35,814 from 31,811.
    Number three Chrysler's car sales gained to 0.4 pct to
25,286 from 25,191 while its truck sales gained 15 pct to
15,565 from 13,585. The truck sales were a record for the
period, the company said.

rose 4.9 pct to 849 from 809.
