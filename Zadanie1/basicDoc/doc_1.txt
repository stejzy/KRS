Expiration dates on upland cotton
certificates issued under the 1986 upland cotton program are
being extended, the Agriculture Department announced.
    The certificates are being extended because of a shortage
of Commodity Credit Corporation inventory available for
exchange with certificates, USDA undersecretary Danial Amstutz
said.
    Presently, upland cotton commodity certificates expire nine
months from the last day of the month of issuance.
    Under the new procedure, all current outstanding and all
new upland cotton certificates issued under the 1986 upland
cotton program will have an expiration date of either February
29, 1988, or nine months from the last day of the month in
which the certificate is issued, whichever is later.

default on the June 1 interest payment and will have to seek
protection from creditors under the Federal Bankruptcy Act.
    The exchange offer faces numerous obstacles, including the

The House Ways and Means Committee
is moving toward passage of a trade bill that sponsors said was
intended to help open foreign markets to U.S. agricultural
goods and to modify some U.S. agricultural trade laws.
    The trade subcommittee voted to require President Reagan to
take into account the potential harm to U.S. agricultural
exports of any trade retaliation he might impose for foreign
unfair trade practices against other domestic industries.
    The bill would allow U.S. agricultural producers to seek
government monitoring of imports if there is a reasonable
chance the industry would be harmed by an import surge.
    The full Ways and Means Committee is to consider the bill
next week and congressional sources said they expect it will be
approved.
     In investigations involving a processed agricultural
product, trade associations of processors or producers would
have to petition for relief from foreign dumping or unfair
duties.
     The bill sets out U.S. trade negotiating objectives for
the Uruguay round of talks under the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade. It would seek fair trade in agriculture,
seek to discipline restrictive or trade distorting import and
export practices, to eliminate tariffs, subsidies, quotas and
non-tariff barriers.
     President Reagan's authority to negotiate a new GATT
agreement would be extended through January 1993 and authority
to negotiate a free trade zone with Canada would be extended
through January 3, 1991.
    The bill extends Reagan's authority to negotiate an
international coffee agreement through October 31, 1989.
    It allows a refund of import duties paid on raw sugar
imported from November 1, 1977 to March 31, 1985 for production
of sugar or products containing sugar and destined for
re-export. The export of the sugar or products must occur
before Octoer 1, 1991.
    Presently, to qualify for the refund the sugar must be
processed within three years after import and exported within
five years.
    Agriculture would also benefit from more rapid decisions in
complaints of unfair foreign trade practices or injury from
imports.

Central banks have easily beaten back
the foreign exchange market's first test of the industrialized
nations' recent pact to stabilize currencies, analysts said.
    In active trading this week, the market pushed the dollar,
sterling, the Canadian dollar and Australian dollar higher. But
operators got their fingers burned as one by one the central
banks signalled their displeasure.
    "So far G-6 has been a roaring success,"said James O'Neill,
financial markets economist at Marine Midland Bank NA.
    "The central banks are sending strong signals that they
won't tolerate any kind of momentum building behind
currencies," added a senior corporate trader at one U.K. bank.
    On February 22, the finance ministers and central bank
governors of the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France and the U.K.
-- the Group of Five -- plus Canada, signed an accord under
which they agreed to cooperate closely to foster stability of
exchange rates around prevailing levels.
    The agreement was viewed by many in the market as an
attempt to put a floor under the dollar after its sizeable
two-year decline against major world currencies.
    And initially, traders indicated their respect for the
accord by refraining from pushing the dollar lower.
    But by Wednesday, the dollar climbed to more than 1.87
marks, about five pfennigs above its levels the Friday before
the G-6 accord.
    The move was aided by indications that the U.S. economy
picked up steam in February at the same time as the West German
economy was regressing.
    But dealers said the Federal Reserve Bank of New York gave
traders a sharp reminder that the G-6 pact had encompassed the
idea of limiting inordinate dollar gains as well as declines.
    Dealers differed as to whether the U.S. central bank
actually intervened to sell dollars above 1.87 marks, or simply
telephoned dealers to ask for quotes and enquire about trading
conditions.
    But the dollar quickly backed off. It hovered today around
1.85 marks. "The market was surprised that the Fed showed its
face so soon," said Marine Midland NA's O'Neill.
    Also on Wednesday, London dealers said the Bank of England
intervened in the open market to sell sterling as the U.K.
currency rose to 1.60 dlrs compared with 1.5355 dlrs before the
G-6 pact.
    Sterling, along with the other high-yield currencies like
the Australian dollar and Canadian dollar, was in favor after
traders surmised that the the chance of intervention pursuant
to the Paris currency accord left limited room for profit plays
on dollar/mark and dollar/yen.
    The pound also was boosted by suggestions of an improving
U.K. economy, anticipation of a popular British budget on March
17 and public opinion polls showing good chances for the
incumbent Conservative party in any general election.
    "There was a real run on sterling," said Anne Mills of
Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
    Sterling traded today around 1.5750 dlrs, down from 1.5870
dlrs last night. It slid to 2.917 marks from 2.950 yesterday
and from a peak of about 2.98 recently. "There's been some
heavy profit-taking on sterling/mark ahead of next Tuesday's
U.K. budget," said James McGroarty of Discount Corp.
    As speculators detected the presence of the U.S. and
British central banks, they acclerated their shift into
Canadian and Australian dollars. But here too they were
stymied. The Bank of Canada acted to slow its currency's rise.
    The Canadian dollar traded at 1.3218/23 per U.S. dollar
today, down from 1.3185/90 yesterday.
    And the Australian Reserve Bank, using the Fed as agent,
sold Australian dollars in the U.S. yesterday, dealers said.
    The Australian dollar fell to a low of 67.45/55 U.S. cents
today from a high of 69.02 Thursday.
    Analysts said the central banks' moves to stifle sudden
upward movement, leave the market uncertain about its next
step. Today, the focus shifted to the yen which has held to a
very tight range against the dollar for several months.
    The dollar fell to 152.35/40 yen from 153.35/40 last night.
Analysts said the yen also gained as traders unwound long
sterling/short mark positions established lately.
    "Because of the change in perceptions about the health of
the German economy, the funds from those unwinding operations
are ending up in yen," a dealer at one U.K. bank said.
    Recent West German data have shown falling industry orders,
lower industrial output and slowing employment gains.
    Moreover, the yen is benefitting as Japanese entities who
have invested heavily overseas, for example in Australian
financial instruments, repatriate their profits ahead of the
end of the Japanese fiscal year on March 31.
    Noting that the dollar/yen rate is in a sense the most
controversial one because of the large U.S. trade deficit with
Japan, analysts said the stage could be set for another test of
the dollar's downward scope against the Japanese currency.
    In its latest review of the foreign exchange market through
the end of January, the Federal Reserve revealed that it
intervened to protect the dollar against the yen on January 28.
On that day, the dollar fell as low as 150.40 yen.
    "Sure, the Fed bought dollars near the 150 yen level in
January. But the market has to bear in mind that time marches
on and the situation changes," said McGroarty of Discount.

    Weyerhaeuser reported 1986 earnings of 276.7 mln dlrs, or
1.91 dlrs per share, on 5.65 billion dlrs in revenues.
    Anticipated improved cash flows will allow the company to

other engineered products directed toward specific, rather than
commodity, end-use markets.
    But it said growth may be higher in added-value products,
in financial services and in other diversified businesses.
    In addition, the company said rising product prices and
demand for pulp and paper are reflected in all the major world
markets, except in the case of some light-weighted paper grades
where overcapacity remains a problem.
    Weyerhaeuser further stated that it has lowered its

fourth quarter and full-year ended January 31.
    A company spokesman said specific figures were unavailable.
    Varity posted a net profit of 3.9 mln U.S. dlrs for the
previous fiscal year ended January 31, 1986 and a 3.3 mln dlr
net profit for the previous fourth quarter. Its net loss for
the nine months ended October 31 totaled 4.7 mln dlrs after a

member, a member organization or affiliated person may trade as
principal or agent in any listed stock on any organized

U.S. Agriculture Department (USDA)
figures for highly-erodible land enrolled into the Conservation
Reserve Program were regarded by most grain analysts as neutral
to bearish, although some said a full state-by-state breakdown
would be needed to assess the full price impact.
    "Out of 10.5 mln acres only 1.9 mln acres were accepted in
corn -- That's neutral at best and perhaps bearish to what the
trade was looking for," Dale Gustafson of Drexel Burnham
Lambert said.
    The USDA said it had accepted 10,572,402 more acres into
the conservation program out of bids on a total of 11,254,837
acres.
    Gustafson said he would not be changing his estimate of
planted acreage for corn as a result of the latest figures, but
some other analysts said they would adjust their estimates
slightly. The USDA is due to release planting intentions
figures March 31.
    Indications of a heavy sign-up in the conservation program
recently lowered most trade estimates of corn planted acreage
to 63.0 to 67.0 mln acres from 67.0 to 69.0 mln.
    Richard Loewy, analyst with Prudential Bache Securities,
said there was not enough information to completely assess the
conservation figures. "The 1.9 mln acres on corn is certainly
disappointing," he added.
    The USDA later released the state-by-state breakdown of the
enrollment figures.
    Loewy said the initial figures appeared to be negative for
both new crop corn and soybeans, and might possibly mean an
upward adjustment in planting intention figures.
    Asked about the impact on the flow of generic certificates
onto the market this spring, he said: "The trade was definitely
looking higher, so certificates are going to be less than
expected."
    The USDA offered a special corn "bonus" rental payment to
the farmers to be paid in generic certificates. The bonus
amounts to two dlrs per bushel, based on the farm program
payment yield for corn, for each acre of corn accepted into the
reserve.
    Katharina Zimmer, analyst for Merrill Lynch Futures, said
the conservation sign-up was slightly higher than she had
expected, although she noted that some trade expectations were
considerably higher than the actual figures.
    "I think it is friendly for the market, at least in the
long run," she said.
    Susan Hackmann of AgriAnalysis said there was some
confusion over whether trade ideas of an enrollment figure
between 15 and 18 mln acres referred to the total sign-up or
the latest addition.
    "It seems the trade was looking for more acres to be bid
into the program," she said.
    Hackmann said she would not make much change to her ideas
about corn planting figures as a result of the conservation
sign-up. She added that while some trade guesses were as low as
61 mln acres, she was looking for corn plantings to be in the
high 60's.
    Zimmer of Merrill Lynch said she would be making a slight
reduction of about one mln acres in her planting estimate to
around 64 mln acres.
    New crop corn prices at the Chicago Board of Trade firmed
earlier this week on ideas of a large sign-up in the program,
despite the fact that acres enrolled are generally poor
yielding and not likely to make a substantial difference to
final production figures.

U.S. economic data due out next week is
unlikely to hold any surprises that will shake U.S. interest
rate futures out of their relatively narrow trading range of
the last 3-1/2 months, financial analysts said.
    "People don't seem to have any firm conviction about the
current strength of the economy or about the Federal Reserve
doing anything," said Drexel Burnham Lambert analyst Norman
Mains.
    The narrow range trading is also taking its toll on trading
volume, he noted. "We've had a decline in activity as recent
economic statistics have not greatly changed people's
viewpoints on interest rates," Mains said.
    The data, which has provided not clear-cut view of the
economy, coupled with dampened activity in the foreign exchange
markets after the Paris initiative has made for "less than
ebullient market action," Mains said.
    He added, however, that Treasury bond futures could be in
for a retracement after the recent rise as they are near the
top of the trading range.
    "My view is that the economy remains relatively strong and
market participants will see that current prices are
unjustified," Mains said.
    Refco Inc senior vice president Michael Connery also noted
that the market is showing very little momentum and lacks
retail interest. "All of the movement occurs at the opening,"
afterwhich volume dwindles and momentum fades, Connery said.
    Although data during the week was mildly positive for bond
prices, the small rise in February producer prices and downward
revisions in January retail sales and industrial production
were "not real exciting," said Prudential Bache analyst Fred
Leiner.
    "There is no one factor that will push us through the highs
at this moment," Leiner said.
    Next week's revision to fourth quarter U.S. Gross national
Product is also likely to be of little interest to the market,
said Kleinwort Benson chief financial economist Sam Kahan.
Still, forecasts for first quarter GNP could play a role in the
direction of bond prices over the next month.
    Kahan said his early estimate for first quarter growth is
around three pct, due largely to a buildup in inventories
reflected in the January inventory data Friday, which showed
the largest increase since 1979.
    "The key question will be not whether there is a large
increase in first quarter GNP, but whether any increase is
sustainable or a one shot deal," Kahan said.
    He said that a sizable increase in first quarter GNP
stemming from an increase in inventories will be a drag on
second quarter growth.
    If that is the case, GNP in the second quarter could ease
back to a one to two pct growth rate, Kahan said.

Britain's ruling Conservatives have a
nine point lead over the main opposition Labour Party, their
biggest in two years, according to an opinion poll published in
the Sunday Times.
    The MORI poll's findings come as the latest in a series of
setbacks for Labour and are bound to encourage talk that Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher may call a general election in June.
    The poll gives the Conservatives a rating of 41 pct against
32 pct for Labour and 25 pct for the centrist Liberal-Social
Democratic Alliance -- enough to give Thatcher an overall
majority of 46 seats in the 650-seat House of Commons.
    The poll, which follows a survey by Marplan last week
giving the Conservatives a six-point lead over Labour, shows
how dramatically the fortunes of Britain's two largest parties
have changed over the past six months.
    As recently as September, Labour was still ahead in opinion
polls and was looking forward to forming Britain's next
government. Since then, it has been beset by inner wrangling
and its popularity among Britain's voters has tumbled.
    Morale among Labour politicians slumped further last month
when the party lost a key by-election in Greenwich, south
London -- a seat which Labour had held for 50 years.

Tense trade relations with the U.S.
And Japan and concern about the foreign impact of a proposed
European Community (EC) tax on edible oils and fats are
expected to dominate talks by EC foreign ministers here
tomorrow.
    EC diplomats said Britain demanded the early debate on the
EC Executive Commission's proposal to impose a hefty tax on
domestic and imported oils and fats in an attempt to head off a
proposal it sees as extremely damaging to EC foreign relations.
    The proposal was the most controversial part of a reform
package, due to be discussed by EC farm ministers later this
month, of the EC's Common Agricultural Policy -- widely seen as
the root cause of the EC's persistent financial problems and of
tensions with major trading partners.
    The proposal is described by its promoters as a
stabilisation program which would penalise a new sector going
into massive overproduction and complement proposals to cut
cereals and dairy production, rather than a straight forward
tax.
    They say it would not only curb the growth of oils and fats
production and prevent imports from filling any vaccum left by
a fall in EC output, but would also save the EC some two
billion European Currency Units, over two billion dlrs, in farm
costs.
    It has provoked strong protests from domestic producers as
well as foreign exporters, led by the United States.
    The diplomats said the protests had been received from most
corners of the developing and developed world, ranging from
Senegal, Malaysia and Indonesia, to Brazil, Argentina, Canada,
Iceland and Norway.
    The proposal had little chance of approval by EC
governments, with West Germany as strongly opposed to it as
Britain, and Denmark, the Netherlands and Portugal also
unconvinced of its political or economic wisdom.
    Even Mediterranean countries such as Italy, France and
Greece, which backed similar proposals in the past, did not
seem as enthusiastic now because olive oil had been added to
the list of products affected.
    But the diplomats said a protectionist lobby in the U.S.
And elsewhere was using the proposal as an excuse to promote
anti-EC action, and the foreign ministers' debate should
demonstrate the strength of feeling against the proposal within
the EC and deprive its oponents of this argument.
    The ministers were also due to discuss proposals in the
U.S. Congress for a range of protecionist legislation such as a
bill that would curb EC textile exports.
    The diplomats said the ministers were expected to strongly
back a Commission warning to Washington that such a bill, if
enacted, would provoke swift EC retaliation.

Automobiles Citroen expects rising
sales of its new AX compact car to help boost profits
significantly this year, continuing a financial recovery after
six straight years of losses, president Jacques Calvet said.
    Speaking to reporters during weekend trials for the new AX
sports model, he said: "All the budgetary forecasts that we have
been able to make ... Show a relatively significant improvement
in 1987, compared with 1986," he added.
    Citroen, part of the private Peugeot SA <PEUP.PA> group,
increased its share of the French new car market to 13.7 pct in
first two months 1987 from 12.1 pct a year earlier. It is
aiming for an average 12.8 pct share throughout the year after
11.7 pct in 1986.
    The firm believes it is on target to raise its share of the
European market, excluding France, to 3.2 pct this year from
2.9 pct in 1986.
    "Our first problem is to produce enough vehicles to meet the
demand," Calvet said. "This is a relatively new problem for us."
    Citroen lost close to two billion francs in 1984 but cut
the deficit to 400 mln in 1985, helped by moves to modernise
its range and improve productivity.
    Calvet indicated last December he expected Citroen's 1986
profit to be between 250 and 500 million francs.
    This weekend he said that those profit estimates "remain
about the same -- perhaps even a little more optimistic."
    Some of this optimism is due to the early success of the
AX, launched on the French market last October. It will be
available throughout most of western Europe within four months.
    The car has registered just over 20,000 sales.
    It is being built at Citroen's large plant at Aulnay-sous-
Bois in northern Paris, as well as at Rennes in Brittany and
Vigo in Spain, with production just reaching target level of
1,000 cars a day.
    The car, which Citroen markets as an intermediate model
between its long-running 2CV and the Visa, is designed to
compete with the Renault 5, Volkswagen Polo and Opel Corsa.
    The AX had built up its market share in France to around
four pct last month. Calvet said: "Our hope is that once the AX
is fully developed, we will have between 6.5 and seven per cent
of the national market."

Leading industrial nations will meet
again next month to review their accord on currency stability,
but U.S. Officials said financial markets are convinced for now
the countries will live up to commitments to speed up economic
growth.
    The narrow currency movements of recent weeks strongly
suggests the six leading industrial countries have tamed the
normally unruly financial markets and next month's talks seem
likely to build on that stability.
    A Reagan administration official said the Paris agreement
last month was the main reason markets were calm.
    But he said in an interview that financial markets also
understood, "That all six countries concluded that the measures
to be taken over a period of time in the future should foster
stability of exchange rates around current levels. That is in
fact what has happened since Paris."
    Monetary analysts said stability has been helped in part by
the decision of industrial nations to bury the hatchet and
cease to quarrel over short-term policy objectives.
    Instead they have focused on medium-term policy goals, but
left room to adjust their agreements with periodic meetings.
    The official refused to comment, however, on whether the
agreement included a secret pact to consider further
coordinated interest rate cuts -- a measure industrial nations
have taken jointly several times in the past year.
    On February 22, the United States, Japan, West Germany,
France, Britain and Canada agreed that major currencies were
within ranges broadly reflecting underlying economic
conditions, given commitments by Washington to cut its budget
deficit and by Toyko and Bonn to boost economic growth.
    The shake-up would strengthen the U.S. Position in
future international talks.
    "I think these changes will strengthen the President's hand
politically and the stronger he is politically the better off
we are with the Congress and the better off we are in
international fora," said the official, an Administration
economic policymaker. "So it would be beneficial to the
continued conduct of our initiatives."
    But the official also said the Administration would resist
calls for a tax increase to cut the budget deficit -- a target
Europeans say is crucial to help curb economic instability.
    Last week, dealers said the Federal Reserve intervened to
stop the dollar rising against the mark, which had breached
1.86 to the dollar. British authorities are also understood to
have intervened to curb sterling's strength.
    International monetary sources say finance ministers and
central bankers, who will review market performance and their
own economic prospects, will reassemble again in Washington
just before the April 9 policymaking meeting of the
International Monetary Fund.
    The sources said Italy, which refused to join the Paris
pact, was invited back by Treasury Secretary James Baker.
    Since Paris, there are signs West German growth is slowing,
while U.S. Officials said they were giving Japan until April to
show that an economic stimulus package was in the offing.
    Signs of concern about German prospects emerged recently
when Bundesbank (central bank) president Karl Otto Poehl told
bankers he would consider cutting West German interest rates if
the Fed was ready to follow suit.
    A Reagan Administration official said this would show there
had been some change in approach on the part of the central
bank in Germany.
    But he declined to comment on the prospects for action by
the Fed and the Bundesbank.
    "If there is such a provision it is private and if I talked
about it, it would no longer be private," said the official, who
asked not to be identified.
    Public comments by Fed officials suggest the central bank
is keeping credit conditions broadly unchanged, but if the
major economies continue to show sluggish growth and the U.S.
Trade deficit remains stubbornly high, further coordinated
action could be on the April agenda.

Harper and Row Publishers Inc said its
board of directors decided to take no action on two takeover
bids that the company has received. Instead, it appointed a
committee of independent directors to study strategic
alternatives for the 170-year-old firm.
    The alternatives include continuation of the company's
existing business plans, possible business combinations, sales
of stock, restructuring and the sale of all or part of the
company.
    Kidder Peabody and Co Inc has been retained to advise on
the alternatives, Harper and Row added.
    Private investor Theodore Cross last week offered 34 dlrs a
share for Harper and Row, prompting a rival bid of 50 dlrs a
share from another publishing firm, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich
Inc <HBJ>.
    After considering the two offers at a meeting on Friday,
the Harper and Row board decided not to act on them.
    The directors unanimously expressed their strong desire to
preserve the company's independence and take advantage of its
"considerable future prospects," according to director Winthrop
Knowlton, former chief executive and now chairman of the newly
established independent committee.
    "However, given the significant current interest in the
company, we also feel that we should carefully review all the
options available. The committee will consider all the
pertinent facts and alternatives.... We intend to make a
careful and informed decision but will proceed expeditiously to
a conclusion," Knowlton said.
    Pending its deliberations, Harper and Row's board has
postponed indefinitely a special meeting of stockholders that
had been scheduled for April 2 to discuss a proposal to
recapitalize the company's stock to create two classes of
shares with different voting rights.

The extraordinary foreign exchange
loss of 480 mln marks reported last week by Volkswagen AG
<VOWG.F> (VW) is so large that outside currency traders were
probably involved in the case, currency sources said.
    They were commenting after weekend newspaper reports that
prosecutors were transferring the focus of their enquiries to
Frankfurt, West Germany's main foreign exchange centre.
    Volkswagen announced last Tuesday that it had called in
prosecutors to investigate a possible fraud involving currency
hedging.
    The newspaper Welt am Sonntag said the investigation by
state prosecutors was now considering whether the alleged VW
currency manipulators had outside banking accomplices.
    The transactions were only possible, "because the culprits
possessed genuine bank forms, with the help of which they were
able to deceive controllers for years," the newspaper said.
    But currency sources said there were so many loopholes in
every bank's currency dealing system that controls could easily
be avoided.
    Rolf Selowsky, financial member of the management board,
has resigned in the wake of the affair, a VW spokesman said.
    Selowksy's resignation followed a VW announcement on Friday
that foreign exchange chief Burkhard Junger had been dismissed
and Guenther Borchert, head of the financial transfer
department, had been suspended along with Siegfried Mueller,
head of the central cash and currency clearing.
    Four other members of the foreign exchange staff were also
suspended, but no charges have been laid.
    VW Supervisory board chairman Karl Gustaf Ratjen said
entire data tapes had been erased and programs altered in
forged transactions.
    Der Spiegel magazine said VW financial controllers
discovered the uncovered positions on February 18 when VW
expected a currency forward contract with the Hungarian
National Bank to mature, but Hungarian bank officials said they
knew nothing of the transaction and the supposed contracts were
forgeries.
    The Budapest-based bank refused to buy the dollars and has
not commented on the affair.
    The Hungarian National Bank is, along with the Soviet Bank
of Foreign Trade, one of two major East Bloc currency traders
and most major banks based in Germany deal with it regularly.
    It would not be possible, the sources said, for any bank to
renege on a genuine forward contract since this would
immediately become known and effectively prevent the bank from
operating further in the spot or forward currency markets.
    Longer-maturity forward contracts, even contracts of up to
10 years, were now becoming more common, they said but the
longer and larger the contract, the more likely it was that it
would be transacted with a domestic institution.
    Being one of Germany's most diversified multi-nationals, VW
has exposure in a large number of currencies and dealt in these
with most banks in Frankfurt and also abroad, sometimes through
currency brokers, although it has the reputation of doing
relatively little hedging, currency sources said.
    "They (VW) are always in the market, more or less trading as
a bank," one senior dealer said.
    Some newspaper reports said the losses were incurred
because of VW's failure to take out currency hedging contracts
beginning at the end of 1984, when the dollar was rising.
    But the currency sources said market speculation was that
dollar income of around one billion dlrs was involved and that
the bulk of the transactions occurred last year since which
time around 50 pfennigs per dollar was lost when the dollar
fall continued.
    Longer-maturity currency contracts for more than 100 or 200
mln dlrs each were rare. Taking several in this size out with a
single bank would be easily spotted by financial controllers.
    One senior dealer for a German bank said, "There's no way
they can have hoped to get away with it. It's too big."
    The sources added that the involvement of the Federal
Criminal Office (BKA) in Wiesbaden could indicate that the
investigation would lead outside Germany.
    BKA has the mandate to handle criminal cases that may
involve foreign police forces or supranational services such as
Interpol. However the branch also handles cases that transcend
federal state borders within Germany.

The Bank of Japan is satisfied with the
yen around its current range, a senior central bank official
told reporters.
    He said the pledge by major industrial nations in Paris
last month to cooperate to hold exchange rates around current
ranges applied in both directions, a dollar fall or a dollar
rise.
    Unilateral intervention itself cannot ensure currency
stability, but it can be useful when coordinated with other
policies and with other central banks, he said.
    The Bank of Japan is rather confident currency stability
will continue for some time, the senior bank official said, but
declined to be more specific.
    Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told parliament on Friday
the current dollar/yen exchange rate is not necessarily
satisfactory for the Japanese economy.
    Asked what factors might destabilize the markets, the
official cited a lessening of market fear about intervention, a
completely unexpected change in the economy of Japan, the U.S.
Or West Germany, or resumption of comments by government
officials seeking to talk the dollar up or down.
    The senior bank official said he expects Japan's gross
national product (GNP) to grow three pct or slightly more in
the fiscal year beginning in April. That would be little
changed from the performance expected this year.
    Domestic demand may grow nearly four pct in 1987/88, but
the external sector will have a negative impact on GNP of
nearly one percentage point, he said.
    He said there was virtually no room for further monetary
policy action to boost the economy. The economy's performance
in the future very much depends on fiscal policy, he added.
    The central bank's monetary policy has already done its
part in stimulating the economy, the senior bank official said.
The Bank of Japan has cut its discount rate five times over the
last year and a half.
    Although the central bank does not see any imminent risk of
inflation, there could be some problems in the future, he said.
"We are sitting on a barrel of powder, but fortunately it may
still be wet," he added.
    Liquidity among private households and especially the
corporate sector has increased substantially, he said.
    The liquidity is the reason for the recent boom of stock
exchange prices, the bank official said. This inflow of funds
into the stock exchange, occurring also in other countries, may
continue, he said.
    The senior official said the Bank of Japan is hoping
Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker will be re-appointed when
his current term expires later this year.
    "He's a great man," the official said, adding that more and
more people expect his reappointment.
    Turning to exchange rates, the official said the
substantial drop in the dollar is beginning to have an effect
on reducing the imbalance in world trade, even though the
impact has taken longer than expected to show through. Even the
U.S. Trade position has begun to feel the impact, although so
far it has not been very strong, he said.

Opposition to government plans to impose
a five pct sales tax is spreading nationwide ahead of the start
of campaigning for local elections next week, political
analysts said.
    The Asahi Shimbun said 31 of the 47 prefectural assemblies
had so far opposed, demanded amendments to, or expressed
wariness about the tax. Assemblymen from the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party (LDP) have also joined the opposition against
the tax in 11 prefectural assemblies, the daily reported.
    About 2,600 elections will be held on April 12 and 26 for a
wide range of local posts, including 13 governors.
    The sales tax is one of the main planks of Prime Minister
Yasuhiro Nakasone's plan to overhaul the tax system.
    A close aide to Nakasone has said the sales tax issue will
have a minimal impact on the local elections because centrist
parties by and large support LDP candidates in many of the
races for governors. In the assembly elections, even LDP
candidates oppose the tax, he said.
    On March 8, the LDP lost an Upper House by-election in the
conservative stronghold of Iwate Prefecture in northern Japan
for the first time in 25 years. The opposition socialist winner
campaigned on the single issue of the sales tax.
    The surprise LDP defeat in Iwate, coupled with Nakasone's
sagging popularity, has forced the party to compromise with the
opposition and agree to postpone public hearings on the fiscal
1987/88 budget to March 19/20 from March 13/14.
    The opposition parties have been staging recurring
parliamentary boycotts to show their disapproval of the sales
tax contained in the budget. They returned to the Lower House
Budget Committee last Friday but walked out again after a few
hours, demanding detailed data on the tax. But parliamentary
sources said they are expected to agree in a day or two to
dispose of some of 29 bills the LDP will submit.
    The bills include nine which will become extinct on March
31 unless some action is taken, the sources said. These cover
such uncontroversial topics as wages for diplomats and
revisions of the law covering court employees.
    Discussion is also expected of a provisional budget to
allow the government to continue operating while debate on the
main budget continues beyond the April 1 start of fiscal
1987/88, the sources said. The provisional budget could cover
some 50 days and include authorisation for spending on some
public works. Otherwise, parliament will go into virtual recess
until local elections start on April 12, they said.

The extended decline in Japan's overall
business performance was likely to bottom out in the current
January-March quarter, the Finance Ministry said.
    Improved corporate earnings and better prospects for the
stability of the yen had made companies more optimistic, it
said after carrying out a quarterly survey.
    The survey, conducted in February, was based on
questionnaires returned by 8,328 large and small firms in all
sectors except the finance and insurance industries.
    The survey said overall corporate earnings were expected to
turn positive with an estimated 0.4 pct year on year increase
in the second half of fiscal 1986 ending on March 31 after a
5.4 pct decrease in the first half.
    Corporate earnings will grow further in the first half of
fiscal 1987, rising an estimated 10.7 pct, it added.
    Manufacturers' earnings, hit hard by the yen's steady rise
against the dollar, will rise 7.7 pct in first-half fiscal 1987
after falling 10.7 pct in the second half of fiscal 1986, it
said.
    Overall earnings of non-manufacturing companies will rise
11.8 pct year on year in the first half of fiscal 1987 after
growing 9.8 pct in the second half of fiscal 1986, the survey
said.
    It said this figure was bolstered by profits of firms such
as electric power and gas companies which have benefitted from
the yen's appreciation.

Japan should step up the pace of its
financial liberalisation if it wants to become a world
financial centre equal to New York or London, a leading U.S
banker said.
    "For Tokyo to become the third link in an international
capital markets triangle, it will need to create an environment
more hospitable to international finance than currently exists,"
Robert Binney, senior vice-president of Chase Manhattan Bank
N.A., Told a group of Japanese members of parliament and
financial leaders.
    Binney said Japan must liberalise its financial markets not
just to attract more jobs, capital and taxable income, but also
to recycle effectively its vast trade surpluses to help counter
growing protectionism in the United States.
    He called on Japan to remove all controls on deposit
interest rates soon and to remove obstacles to the growth of
its offshore market. He also said it should fully deregulate
its short-term money markets, develop comprehensive futures
markets, further open the Tokyo Stock Exchange to foreign
membership and remove fixed rate brokerage commissions.
    Binney also urged Japan to abolish Article 25 of its
Securities and Exchange Law which, like the U.S. Glass Steagall
Act, separates commercial from investment banking.
    At the same meeting Goldman Sachs (Japan) Corp president
Eugene Atkinson urged Japan to fully de-regulate short-term
interest rates, introduce commercial paper and open long-term
government bond markets to an auction system.
    He said Japan should allow securities firms to participate
in foreign exchange business and develop over-the-counter stock
options and futures. Short-selling of Japanese government cash
bonds was a vital hedging mechanism, he added.
    The group of some 60 Japanese legislators and financial
leaders which Atkinson and Binney addressed was recently formed
to study ways in which Japan should promote liberalisation of
its financial markets.
    "We should not leave such matters solely to government
bureaucrats," Masao Hori, Chairman of the lower house finance
committee, told the group.

intention was to develop an original machine."
    Industry analysts said NEC controls about 70 pct of the

The Bundesbank came into the domestic
money market to add temporary liquidity through federal
government funds as call money rates rose above 4.0 pct,
dealers said.
    They estimated that the bulk of liquidity was added at
about 3.95 pct. Call money fell to 3.90/4.0 pct after the move.
It had been 3.80/90 on Friday.
    The move came as call money extended a rise begun Friday
after the Bundesbank took up some six billion marks owed to it
by other European central banks after currency interventions in
the framework of European Monetary System in January.
    Rates could ease further in trading today but dealers
expect them to rise later in the week as banks begin paying out
funds for tax payments on behalf of clients.
    Some 30 billion marks is likely to leave the market this
month, with the bulk being paid out next week.
    In anticipation of this liquidity drain, banks have stocked
up reserves at the Bundesbank.
    On Thursday, minimum reserve holdings declined to 57.0
billion marks from 60.0 billion on Wednesday but were well
above the 53.2 billion held on Tuesday. Daily average reserve
holdings rose slightly to 54.7 billion marks from 54.5 billion.
    The daily average reserve holdings were above the level of
around 51 billion marks dealers said is needed for the required
daily average for the month.
    With the heavy tax drain in March, banks are likely to
remain cautious about taking more liquidity out of reserves
than is absolutely necessary.
    However, a new securities repurchase pact likely to be
added next week to replace a facility expiring then could
somewhat offset the drain.
    The Bundesbank is expected to allocate more than the 3.4
billion marks which is due to be rolled over, dealers said.

Japanese banks may have to realize
significant losses on their seven billion dlrs in perpetual
floating rate notes after the recent collapse of the market,
bankers said.
    How much of a loss is realized in the current fiscal year
ending March 31 depends on the accounting treatment recommended
by the Finance Ministry. Ministry sources said the Ministry has
yet to decide what guidance to give Japanese banks in valuing
the perpetual floating rate notes they hold.
    The notes are held by Japanese city, trust, long-term and
regional banks, including their overseas branches.
    Roughly half of the Japanese banks assess foreign asset
portfolios on the basis of current market prices while the
others assess them at either the acquisition cost or the
current market price, whichever is lower, bankers said.
    With the market for such perpetuals non-existent, Finance
Ministry officials questioned the propriety of using nominal
quotations supplied by the notes' lead managers to determine
bank book losses.
    The Ministry is currently awaiting a legal judgement by the
National Tax Administration Agency on the propriety of using
such quotations, one official said.
    Banks using current market prices alone to value their
holdings can avoid realizing losses now because they can argue
that the market is non-existent and hope for a recovery next
year, bankers said.
    But those banks who use acquisition cost to value foreign
portfolios cannot look to the market, bankers said. The
acquisition cost is obviously higher than the market price,
whatever it may be, these banks must realize losses in the
current fiscal year.

Gold is expected to continue its rise

The credibility of government efforts to
stabilise fluctuating commodity prices will again be put to the
test over the next two weeks as countries try to agree on how a
buffer stock should operate in the cocoa market, government
delegates and trade experts said.
    Only two weeks ago, world coffee prices slumped when
International Coffee Organization members failed to agree on
how coffee export quotas should be calculated. This week, many
of the same experts gather in the same building here to try to
agree on how the cocoa pact reached last summer should work.
    The still unresolved legal wrangle surrounding the
International Tin Council (ITC), which had buffer stock losses
running into hundreds of millions of sterling, is also casting
a shadow over commodity negotiations.
    The ITC's failure has restricted negotiators' ability to
compromise as governments do not want to be involved in pacts
with built-in flaws or unlimited liability, but want clear
lines drawn between aid and trade.
    A more hopeful sign of cooperation was agreement on basic
elements of a new International Natural Rubber Agreement in
Geneva at the weekend.
    Some importing countries insist the International Cocoa
Organization (ICCO) buffer stock rules must not be muddied with
quota type subclauses which might dictate the type of cocoa to
be bought. One consumer country delegate said this would
"distort, not support" the market.
    Trade and industry sources blame uncertainty about the ICCO
for destabilising the market as the recent collapse in coffee
prices has made traders acutely aware that commodity pacts can
founder. On Friday this uncertainty helped push London cocoa
futures down to eight month lows. The strength of sterling has
also contributed to the recent slip in prices.
    The ICCO daily and average prices on Friday fell below the
"must buy" level of 1,600 SDRs a tonne designated in the pact,
which came into force at the last ICCO session in January but
without rules for the operation of the buffer stock.
    Consumers and producers could not agree on how it should
operate and what discretion it should be given. The agreement
limits it to trading physical cocoa and expressly says it
cannot operate on futures markets.
    A cash balance of some 250 mln dlrs and a stock of almost
100,000 tonnes of cocoa, enough to mount large buying or
selling operations, were carried forward from the previous
agreement.
    Members finance the stock through a 45 dlrs a tonne levy on
all cocoa they trade. It has an upper limit of 250,000 tonnes.
    The key arguments being faced by the ICCO working group on
buffer stock rules which is meeting today and tomorrow will be
over non-member cocoa and differentials the buffer stock should
pay when trading different types of cocoa. Another working
group is scheduled to meet Wednesday to discuss administrative
matters, and the full council meets on Thursday.
    Producers have so far maintained that buffer stock funds
should not help mop up surplus cocoa produced in non-member
countries such as Malaysia.
    Consumers say when this cocoa is the cheapest the buffer
stock should buy it rather than compete with chocolate
manufacturers for premium-priced high quality cocoas.
    The argument over buying non-member cocoa is closely linked
to the one over differentials for different qualities.
    European industry and trade advisers have suggested as a
compromise that the buffer stock have a maximum share that can
represent non-member cocoa and that it use the London futures
market's existing differentials for different qualities.
    Currently, good West African cocoa is tendered at par onto
the London market.
    Discounts, which are currently under review, range up to 50
stg a tonne for Brazilian and Malaysian cocoa.
    Consumer delegates said the same arguments in reverse would
operate when prices are high - the buffer stock should sell the
highest priced cocoa in most demand, forcing all prices lower.
    The January talks were slowed by a split inside the
European Community, a key ICCO consumer group, with France
siding with producers. EC representatives met in closed session
in Brussels on Friday in an attempt to reach a common ground
and, a diplomatic source said, narrowed the range of positions
among the 12 nations.
    The source said the EC will be looking for signs of
flexibility on the part of producers in the next few days and
will be able to respond if they are there.
    One ICCO delegate describing the producer/consumer split
said consumer proposals mean buying more cocoa for less and
backs the concept of the pact which is "meant to support the
market where trade buying is not."
    In contrast, he said, producers seem to want to sell their
cocoa to the buffer stock rather than consumers.
    Other, more technical, issues still outstanding include
whether the buffer stock should buy at a single announced
"posted price" as in the previous pact or by announcing it is
buying then accepting offers.
    In either case, delegates said, it is accepted that
producers must be given a clear opportunity to make offers of
cocoa for forward shipment directly to the buffer stock in a
way that is competitive with spot offers made by dealers.

The Bank of Japan is satisfied with the
yen around its current range, a senior central bank official
told reporters.
    He said the pledge by major industrial nations in Paris
last month to cooperate to hold exchange rates around current
ranges applied in both directions, a dollar fall or a dollar
rise.
    Unilateral intervention itself cannot ensure currency
stability, but it can be useful when coordinated with other
policies and with other central banks, he said.
    The Bank of Japan is rather confident currency stability
will continue for some time, the senior bank official said, but
declined to be more specific.
    Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told parliament on Friday
the current dollar/yen exchange rate is not necessarily
satisfactory for the Japanese economy.
    Asked what factors might destabilize the markets, the
official cited a lessening of market fear about intervention, a
completely unexpected change in the economy of Japan, the U.S.
Or West Germany, or resumption of comments by government
officials seeking to talk the dollar up or down.
    The senior bank official said he expects Japan's gross
national product (GNP) to grow three pct or slightly more in
the fiscal year beginning in April. That would be little
changed from the performance expected this year.
    Domestic demand may grow nearly four pct in 1987/88, but
the external sector will have a negative impact on GNP of
nearly one percentage point, he said.
    He said there was virtually no room for further monetary
policy action to boost the economy. The economy's performance
in the future very much depends on fiscal policy, he added.
    The central bank's monetary policy has already done its
part in stimulating the economy, the senior bank official said.
The Bank of Japan has cut its discount rate five times over the
last year and a half.
    Although the central bank does not see any imminent risk of
inflation, there could be some problems in the future, he said.
"We are sitting on a barrel of powder, but fortunately it may
still be wet," he added.
    Liquidity among private households and especially the
corporate sector has increased substantially, he said.
    The liquidity is the reason for the recent boom of stock
exchange prices, the bank official said. This inflow of funds
into the stock exchange, occurring also in other countries, may
continue, he said.

Leading industrial nations will meet
again next month to review their accord on currency stability,
but U.S. Officials said financial markets are convinced for now
the countries will live up to commitments to speed up economic
growth.
    The narrow currency movements of recent weeks strongly
suggests the six leading industrial countries have tamed the
normally unruly financial markets and next month's talks seem
likely to build on that stability.
    A Reagan administration official said the Paris agreement
last month was the main reason markets were calm.
    But he said in an interview that financial markets also
understood, "That all six countries concluded that the measures
to be taken over a period of time in the future should foster
stability of exchange rates around current levels. That is in
fact what has happened since Paris."
    Monetary analysts said stability has been helped in part by
the decision of industrial nations to bury the hatchet and
cease to quarrel over short-term policy objectives.
    Instead they have focused on medium-term policy goals, but
left room to adjust their agreements with periodic meetings.
    The official refused to comment, however, on whether the
agreement included a secret pact to consider further
coordinated interest rate cuts -- a measure industrial nations
have taken jointly several times in the past year.
    On February 22, the United States, Japan, West Germany,
France, Britain and Canada agreed that major currencies were
within ranges broadly reflecting underlying economic
conditions, given commitments by Washington to cut its budget
deficit and by Toyko and Bonn to boost economic growth.
    The shake-up would strengthen the U.S. Position in future
international talks.
    "I think these changes will strengthen the President's hand
politically and the stronger he is politically the better off
we are with the Congress and the better off we are in
international fora," said the official, an Administration
economic policymaker. "So it would be beneficial to the
continued conduct of our initiatives."
    But the official also said the Administration would resist
calls for a tax increase to cut the budget deficit -- a target
Europeans say is crucial to help curb economic instability.
    Currency analysts believe the Paris agreement set secret 
short-term target ranges for their currencies with a specific
agreement to defend those bands with intervention.
    According to market sources, the ranges agreed were 1.60 to
1.90 marks to the dollar, and 140 to 155 yen to the dollar.
    There is no official confirmation that specific bands  were
set, although the agreement used the term "ranges", for the first
time in an international economic agreement.
    The Paris accord stated the six would cooperate closely to
foster currency stability around current levels.
    Last week, dealers said the Federal Reserve intervened to
stop the dollar rising against the mark, which had breached
1.86 to the dollar. British authorities are also understood to
have intervened to curb sterling's strength.
    International monetary sources say finance ministers and
central bankers, who will review market performance and their
own economic prospects, will reassemble again in Washington
just before the April 9 policymaking meeting of the
International Monetary Fund.
    The sources said Italy, which refused to join the Paris
pact, was invited back by Treasury Secretary James Baker.
    Since Paris, there are signs West German growth is slowing,
while U.S. Officials said they were giving Japan until April to
show that an economic stimulus package was in the offing.
    Signs of concern about German prospects emerged recently
when Bundesbank (central bank) president Karl Otto Poehl told
bankers he would consider cutting West German interest rates if
the Fed was ready to follow suit.
    A Reagan Administration official said this would show there
had been some change in approach on the part of the central
bank in Germany.
    But he declined to comment on the prospects for action by
the Fed and the Bundesbank.
    "If there is such a provision it is private and if I talked
about it, it would no longer be private," said the official, who
asked not to be identified.
    Public comments by Fed officials suggest the central bank
is keeping credit conditions broadly unchanged, but if the
major economies continue to show sluggish growth and the U.S.
Trade deficit remains stubbornly high, further coordinated
action could be on the April agenda.

A rash of firings, fears of mass layoffs
and management overtures for wage concessions have set the
stage for all-out war between Eastern Airlines and its unions,
analysts and labor leaders say.
    The bitter labor-management dispute has hurt efforts to
revive the ailing carrier and could ultimately lead Texas Air,
Eastern's new owner, to tranfer scores of Eastern jets to its
non-union sister airlines, analysts said.
    "It's a trump card that Texas Air could resort to if things
get bad enough -- repainting Eastern planes and shifting them
over Continental Airlines," said Louis Marckesano, an analyst
for Janney Montgomery Scott Inc of Philadelphia.
    Eastern lost 130.8 mln dlrs in 1986, and analysts see
little chance of the carrier returning to profitability this
year.
    Since the Miami-based carrier was taken over by Texas Air
last year, the morale of Eastern's 38,000 employees has
plummeted, workers and labor leaders say.
    Some Eastern officials acknowledge privately that morale
problems have contributed to high absenteeism and a decline in
customer service, triggering a barrage of passenger complaints.
    Union leaders are accusing Eastern's managers -- many of
them newly installed by Texas Air chairman Frank Lorenzo -- of
conducting a campaign of harassment and intimidation aimed at
ridding the airline of high-paid, senior employees.
    "It's an underhanded way of forcing experienced people out
in an attempt to cut the company's labor costs," said Nancy
Tauss, vice president of the Transport Workers Union Local 553.
    Some flight attendants complain that they are being stalked
by what they call "spyriders" -- teams of auditors they say
have been hired by Lorenzo to fly on Eastern jets and secretly
examine flight crew performance.
    Since the beginning of the year, at least a dozen flight
attendants have been fired as a result of such audits, some for
having as little as two dlrs missing from liquor sales and
movie headset rentals, Tauss said.
    Eastern officials acknowledge that management is tightening
its accounting procedures and cracking down on absenteeism,
which the airline says cost 70 mln dlrs last year -- the 
highest in the industry.
    But Eastern spokeman Jim Ashlock denied that the Miami-base
airline was using unfair labor tactics. "We're just trying to
correct long-standing problems and that causes some
dissatisfaction," he said.
    U.S. Rep. Newt Gingrich, a Georgia Republican, has met with
groups of dissident Eastern employees in Atlanta and is
reported to have told them he may call for hearings on the
airline's labor tactics.
    Labor and management have a long history of bitter
relations at Eastern Airlines.
    But the conflict has escalated sharply since January 21,
when Eastern president Philip Bakes called for a reduction of
490 mln dlrs, or 29 pct, in annual labor costs, mostly through
union concessions.
    Eastern's three principal unions have rejected demands for
wage cuts and have refused to open their contracts for
renegotiation.
    Union officials say that in retaliation for their
resistance, the airline has launched a "firing frenzy" aimed at
intimidating employees and squeezing concessions from labor.
    During 1986 -- the year in which Texas Air managers assumed
control of Eastern -- 123 flight attendants were fired.  That
was nearly five times greater than 1985, the union said. In the
first two months of this year 35 flight attendants losing their
jobs, according to union records.
    Other unions report similar losses.
    Texas Air last month said it would switch six of Eastern's
wide-body jets to Continental, its cut-rate sister airline.
    Eastern has begun hiring other Texas Air carriers to repair
its planes in several cities and plans to shut down some
maintenance bases, according to a recent internal memo.
    "Texas Air is not going to write checks to Eastern to
underwrite an outmoded labor cost structure," Bakes told a
meeting of Miami businessmen this month. He denied, however,
that Lorenzo planned to strip Eastern of its assets.

This month's endorsement by
International Business Machines Corp <IBM> of two desktop
publishing software products should add some much-needed
standards to one of the fastest growing segments of the
computer industry, analysts say.
    Desktop publishing is a relatively new market but industry
analysts estimate that sales will reach one billion dlrs this
year and jump to six billion dlrs by 1990, fueled by the rush
of corporations to bring their printing and publishing needs
in-house rather than to more expensive outside printers.
    Printing is a big expense for most companies. Analysts
estimate U.S. corporations will spend about six to 20 pct of
their total operating budgets on publishing expenses this year.
    At a desktop publishing conference in Chicago earlier this
month, IBM said it will adopt Adobe Systems Inc's Postscript
typesetting language in future electronic printing products.
IBM also said it will support Microsoft Corp's Windows
operating environment as the graphics interface standard in
future publishing announcements rather than its own Topview
environment.
    "IBM's announcement will give tremendous stimulation to the
development of the desktop publishing market," said David
Goodstein, president of the consulting firm Interconsult Inc.
    "It gives users permission to go ahead and buy products that
are already available without being afraid that they will not
be compatible with whatever IBM does," he said.
    The advent of personal computers, laser printers and
graphics software has allowed users to design and print
brochures, newsletters and a host of other communications at
their desks for a fraction of the cost of an outside printing
firm. Analysts credit Apple Computer with creating desktop
publishing when it introduced its Macintosh personal computer
four years ago, with its easy-to-use formats and excellent
graphics capabilities.
     Since then Digital Equipment Corp, Xerox Corp, Apollo
Computer Inc and a number of other vendors have identified
desktop publishing as a major growth area. IBM entered the
market only last July when it formed its Publishing Systems
Business Unit. IBM's embrace of the already-widely used
Postscript, a language that interprets computer commands and
translates them into instructions for the printer, was an
acknowledgment of what is already a de facto standard.
    Both users and makers of electronic publishing systems said
the support of the world's largest computer maker was critical
to the language's ultimate acceptance by users.
    John Warnock, president of Palo Alto, Calif.-based Adobe,
said, "Ten pct of corporations have (moved) into desktop
publishing but 90 pct are still sitting back and waiting for an
IBM announcement."
    IBM entered a licensing pact with Adobe for Postscript, but
its support of Windows was not quite so broad. IBM recognizes
Windows as a standard but would not comment on the extent of
its commitment to the software.
    Windows, a program integrator, allows personal computer
users to run a number of different applications simultaneously.

Debt securities issued by major U.S.
banks are under pressure in the secondary market as investors
shy away from the paper because of Brazil's suspension of
interest payments last month, analysts and traders said.
    On February 20, Brazil said it would suspend interest
payments on 68 billion dlrs owed to foreign commercial banks.
No date was established for the renewal of payments.
    "Buyers have backed away from bank paper. These securities
have become very difficult to sell despite a rise in their
yields," said one corporate bond trader.
    "Debt issues of major money center banks will probably
continue to trade off until such time as the Brazil situation
is resolved," said Loretta Neuhaus, a vice president with
Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
    "I have not told any of our investors to stay away from the
banks in general," she added. "But I have not received too many
inquiries by prospective buyers lately either."
    Traders said debt securities of U.S. banks that are
perceived by investors to be heavily exposed to Latin American
debtor nations declined moderately in price last week. They
said the difference between bids and offers widened.
    "There is not much trading of bank issues these days," an
underwriter said, referring to the wider bid/offer spreads.
    However, he and others pointed out that the secondary
market has not seen heavy selling by institutions, funds and
other investors.

But it has been far from panicky," said another trader.

A year after squeezing to power with a
narrow bare coalition majority, Gaullist Prime minister Jacques
Chirac has swept away a cobweb of controls and regulations
choking the French economy.
    But France is still waiting for a promised industrial
recovery the government says will follow from its free market
policies. Company profits and the stock market are rising. But
so is unemployment. Growth is stagnant at about two pct a year
and the outlook for inflation, held to a 20-year low of 2.1 pct
in 1986, is uncertain.
    Forced last month to cut the government's 1987 growth
target and raise its inflation estimate, Finance Minister
Edouard Balladur ruled out action to stimulate the economy. But
some government supporters say they fear time for an economic
miracle may be running out.
    The political clock is ticking towards Presidential
elections due by April next year.
    France's economic performance, led by a mixed cast of
right-wing ministers and a socialist President, has won mixed
reviews from non-partisan analysts.
    For Michel Develle, Director of Economic Studies at
newly-privatised Banque Paribas, the government's outstanding
achievement has been to launch "a veritable intellectual
revolution" breaking the staid habits formed by centuries of
state control.
    "The figures may look mediocre -- neither good nor bad --
but set in their context of structural reforms, they are
excellent," Develle said.
    But some analysts say they fear that Balladur, chief
architect of the government's free market policies, may be
pursuing a mirage.
    "The belief that economic liberalism will produce an
explosion of economic forces is ideological" said Indosuez chief
economist Jean Cheval. "Personally I think it's an illusion.
Dirigisme (direction) is a basic fact of the French system,
from school onwards. Ultra-liberalism is impossible."
    Illusion or not, the government has pushed its vision hard.
Over the past year foreign exchange and consumer price controls
have been largely abolished, labour regulations have been
pruned to ease the sacking of redundant workers and a hugely
popular programme has been launched to sell state-owned banks
and industries to private investors.
    Since December, nearly five mln French investors have
bought shares in Cie Financiere de Paribas <PARI.PA> and glass
maker Cie de Saint-Gobain SA <SGEP.PA>, the first two state
companies brought to the stock market under the 300 billion
franc five-year privatisation plan.
    Encouraged by an amnesty for past illegal exports of
capital, and the lifting of most currency controls, money has
flooded into the Paris stockmarket from abroad, helping to lift
the market 57 pct last year and another 12.5 pct since
December.
    At the end of last year the government abolished price
controls that had existed for 42 years on services such as car
repairs and hairdressing, freeing from state intervention small
businesses which account for some 60 pct of the French economy.
    The immediate result was a 0.9 pct rise in consumer prices
in January, partly responsible for a forced revision in the
official 1987 inflation forecast, to 2.5 pct from two pct or
less.
    "But even 2.5 pct would be a fantastic result, when you
consider that prices are now free for the first time since
1945," commented Develle of Paribas.
    Other achievements include a major reduction in the state's
foreign debts, and a cut in the state budget deficit to 141.1
billion francs last year, 2.5 billion francs below target and
down from 153.3 billion in 1985.
    But despite a healthy balance of payments surplus and a
gradual improvement in industrial productivity, the French
franc was forced by speculators in January into a humiliating
three pct devaluation against the West German mark, its second
since Chirac took power.
    A recent report by the Organisation for Economic
Cooperation and Development pilloried French industry for
failing to produce the goods that its potential customers
wanted.
    Outside the mainly state-controlled high technology
sectors, French industrial goods were "increasingly ill-adapted
to demand" and over-priced, the report said.
    French economists, including Cheval at Indosuez, agreed
with the report. "One of the assumptions of the government is
that if you give them freedom, the employers will invest and
modernise....But nine out of ten will say yes, they like
freedom, and then wait to be told which way to go," he said.
    And despite rising industrial investment and the
introduction of special incentives to boost youth employment,
the end-1986 number of jobless was reported at a record 2.7
million, some 300,000 more than a year earlier.
    The problem for the government is that there may be little
more it can do to prod the economy into faster growth.
    French producers failed more than most to take advantage of
last year's oil price falls and growth hopes now rest on the
shaky prospects of expansion in other industrial countries like
West Germany and Japan, they say.

Gold is expected to continue its rise
this year due to renewed inflationary pressures, especially in
the U.S., Hamburg-based Vereins- und Westbank AG said.
    It said in a statement the stabilisation of crude oil
prices and the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries'
efforts to achieve further firming of the price has led to
growing inflationary pressures in the U.S.
    Money supplies in the U.S., Japan and West Germany exceed
central bank limits and real growth of their gross national
products, it added.
    Use of physical gold should rise this year due to increased
industrial demand and higher expected coin production, the bank
said.
    Speculative demand, which influences the gold price on
futures markets, has also risen, the bank said.
    These factors and South Africa's unstable political
situation, which may lead to a temporary reduction in gold
supplies from that country, underscore the firmer sentiment, it
said.

nine point lead over the main opposition Labour Party, their
biggest in two years, according to an opinion poll published
yesterday in the Sunday Times.
    The MORI poll's findings were the latest in a series of
setbacks for Labour and are bound to encourage talk that Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher may call a general election in June.
    The poll gives the Conservatives a rating of 41 pct against
32 pct for Labour and 25 pct for the centrist Liberal-Social
Democratic Alliance -- enough to give Thatcher an overall
majority of 46 seats in the 650-seat House of Commons. The poll
follows a survey by Marplan last week giving the Conservatives
a six-point lead over Labour.

<Avia Group International Inc> 
stockholders filed a class a action suit in Multnomah County
Circuit court seeking to halt the sale of Avia to Reebok
International Ltd <RBOK>.
    Avia stockholders also seek to receive compensation from
the defendants, who include most of Avia directors, according
to court papers.
    The suit grew out a meeting of several dozen dissatisfied
minority stockholders of Avia following the announcement of
Reebok's proposed acquisition of Avia and the sudden drop in
the price of Avia stock.
    The complaint was filed on behalf of Clem Eischen, a
Portland-area resident, who owns 500 shares of Avia, and Robert
Withers, also of the Portland-area, who owns 954 shares, and
other individuals who held stock at the time of Reebok's
announcement. A jury trial has been requested.
    "The actions of the small group that contral Avia have hurt
the little guy," said Eischen.
    The stockholders, according to a statement, have organized
a steering committee.
    The complaint reviews the price action of Avia stock from
March 1986 and noted the plaintifs who purchased stock between
19 dlrs and 25 dlrs per share. The price fell from 24 dlrs to
16.50 dlrs a share following the Reebok announcement.
    The complaint asked the defendants be enjoined from
proceeding with the Reebok acquisition of Avia. It also
requests damages to be determined at the time of trial.
    Avia said it had not seen the court papers and said it had
no comment on the suit.

With the April 15 tax return deadline
less than a month away, confused taxpayers will be converging
on H and R Block Inc's offices to interpret the new tax codes.
    Financial results for the nation's largest tax preparer are
expected to be good in fiscal 1987 but next year could be a
"bonanza," analysts say.
    "For the short term the key word is confusion, Block Vice
President Tom Bloch said in an interview. "When Congress
drastically changes laws, confusion results and tax preparers
benefit," Bloch said.
    "Next year, when taxpayers take the new forms and place
them side by side to compare them, more people will throw their
hands up and say 'I'm going to get help,'" he said.
"Tax forms will look very different next year," he added.
    Kidder Peabody analyst Herbert Buchbinder expects Block's
fiscal 1987 year (to end April 30) to show good gains over
fiscal 1986 earnings of 60.1 mln dlrs or 2.41 dlrs a share on
revenues of 606.7 mln dlrs. He estimates Block's fiscal 1987
earnings at 2.75 to 2.80 dlrs.
    "Next year, Block could have a bonanza," Buchbinder said.
Based on estimates of a larger work force, Block could show a
gain of more than five pct in tax forms prepared, he said. In
the 1986 tax season, Block prepared 9,215,300 U.S. tax returns,
up 1.5 pct over the previous year.
    The Internal Revenue Service estimates about 100 mln
individual income tax returns will be filed for the 1987 tax
season, up from last year's 94 mln forms. Professional tax
preparers accounted for just over 43 million forms, according
to the IRS.
    For the longer term, while confusion will continue to bring
clients into Block's 8,866 tax preparation offices worldwide,
there are some changes in the act that will have a negative
effect, Bloch conceded.
    Certain changes in filing requirements will shorten the tax
return, and in some cases, simplify the form, he noted. In
addition, some low income wage earners will be taken off the
tax rolls, he said.
    Block is currently analyzing its price structure to try to
offset some of the negatives. Last tax season, the average cost
for each return in the U.S. amounted to 48.05 dlrs and 45.73
dlrs worldwide, Bloch said. This tax season, rates will be up
about three or four pct, in line with the inflation rate, he
said.
    Block expects "some expansion" this tax season of its
electronic filing system which directly feeds into the IRS and
can speed up the refund process. Block can choose where and by
how much it wants to expand into the seven cities made
available for the direct filing by the IRS, Bloch noted.
    The IRS estimates about 90,000 returns will be directly
filed this tax season, up from the 26,000 returns injected in
the 1986 tax season.
    First Kansas City analyst Jonathan Braatz said that Block
will benefit greatly from lower tax rates in fiscal 1988.
    Braatz expects Block's advertising budget to be about the
same as last year which will be helped a bit by lower costs for
television ads. "They may get a little more bang for their
buck," he said.
    He estimates Block has about 150 mln dlrs cash on its
balance sheet sheet, and says if interest rates rise it could
be of great benefit to them.

U.S. lawmakers are gearing up for a
showdown between protectionists and free traders as a major
trade bill winds its way through committees to a vote by the
full House of Representatives in late April.
    In a move to toughen U.S. enforcement of trade laws, a key
House subcommittee last week approved a toned down version of
legislation to require President Reagan to retaliate against
foreign countries that follow unfair trade practices.
    This bill will be the cornerstone of congressional efforts
to restore competitiveness of American industries and turn
around last year's record 169 billion dlrs trade deficit.
    Several lawmakers have argued the new trade bill made too
many concessions to Reagan and said they intend to back
amendments to "get tough" with countries that violate trade
agreements or keep out U.S. products.
     On the other hand, congressmen known for their allegiance
to free trade, said the bill ties Reagan's hands too much in
trade disputes and they will seek to restore his negotiating
powers.
    Republican Bill Frenzel of Michigan said the subcommittee's
bill was not one "that a free trader like me could endorse in
all respects," but he emphasized there was a consensus among
trade lawmakers to work toward a bill Reagan and Republicans
would ultimately endorse.
    Frenzel said the goal of trade legislation was, "to make our
trade policy stronger without violating our international trade
agreements. You'll find a lot of people who think we have not
done the former enough. You'll find poeple who think we haven't
avoided violating agreements."
    In a key concession made at the urging of the powerful
chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, the trade
subcommittee backed off a requirement that would have forced
Reagan to automatically impose quotas or tariffs on imports
from countries that engage in unfair trade practices.
    It also agreed he may waive any retaliation if it would
hurt the U.S. economy.
    Ways and Means chairman Dan Rostenkowski, an Illinois
Democrat, insisted the more moderate approach was necessary if
the House wanted to pass a bill Reagan would sign into law.
    Reagan last year had blocked Senate consideration of a
tough House trade bill he branded as protectionist and this
year only reluctantly agreed to support a trade bill when he
saw Democratic leaders were determined to pass a bill.
    As an indication of his success, White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater told reporters Friday the administration still
did not like some provisions. But he added, "Generally we feel
very good about the bipartisan consideration of the trade
legislation. I think we are progressing very well."
    The first battle will take place next week when the full
House Ways and Means Committee considers an amendment by Rep.
Richard Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat, to force countries such
as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan to cut their trade surpluses
with the United States.
    The subcommittee limited the Gephardt plan to provide only
that the existence of a large trade surplus with the United
States will trigger an investigation of unfair trade practices,
but would not automatically set off retaliation.
    Rep. Phil Crane, an Illinois Republican and staunch free
trader, said he will try to further weaken the Gephardt plan.
    Organized labor has pressed lawmakers for more relief from
imports where jobs have been lost to foreign competition.
AFL-CIO president Lane Kirkland this year angered the
administration in a statement that any trade bill Reagan would
sign would not be worth passage in Congress.
    But Rostenkowski set the tone of the trade debate in a
statement, "I'm not trying to write legislation to please Lane
Kirkland. I'm trying to write legislation that will be signed
by the president."
    In writing the bill, the subcommittee rejected calls for
trade relief for specific industries such as textiles.
    Rep. Ed Jenkins, a Democrat from Georgia, agreed to hold
off his fight. He intends to push separately a bill to protect
the domestic textile and shoe industry, an aide said. Reagan
vetoed a similar measure last year.
    House Speaker Jim Wright, a Texas Democrat, is one of the
most influential proponents of aid for specific industries
beset by low priced foreign competition.
    Wright Thursday renewed his call for import relief for the
domestic oil industry and announced his support for a Senate
plan to trigger a temporary oil import tariff when imports
reach half of domestic consumption.
    For the most part, the trade bill's provisions toughen U.S.
enforcement of trade laws. The bill forces the administration
to act rapidly on complaints of unfair trade practices such as
dumping products in the United States at prices below the cost
of production.
    It also forces the administration to act rapidly when an
industry complains that a surge in imports threatens its
existence. Congressmen said the change would have required the
U.S. International Trade Commission to impose limits on car
imports in 1981.

Endotronics Inc said it expects to
incur "substantial losses" for the second quarter ending March
31 and fiscal year ending Sept 30, 1987.
    As one factor behind the anticipated loss, Endotronics
cited a dispute by one of its Japanese distributors, <Yamaha
Inc>, over payment of a 3,686,000 dlr promissory note.
    In a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, Endotronics said the note was for overdue accounts
receivable from sales of instruments to Yamaha and another
Japanese distributor during the company's 1986 fiscal year.
    Endotronics said at its present reduced level of operations
it will exhaust all currently available cash and credit
facilities in early May 1987. It said this assumes full use of
the remaining 1,250,000 dlrs available under a line of credit
from Celanese Corp, which requires approval of Celanese Corp
<CZ>.
    The company said its ability to obtain funding was
adversely affected by a suit filed March 4 by two of its
shareholders seeking to represent a class of holders against
three officers of Endotronics.
    Endotronics said the complaint against it alleges
violations of the federal securities laws in connection with
statements made in the company's annual and quarterly reports.
    The company also said the Securities Division of the
Minnesota Department of Commerce is conducting an inquiry into
the company's Japanese sales for fiscal 1986 and trading by
insiders and brokers in the company's common shares.
    It said similar inquiries are being conducted by the
Securities and Exchange Commission. The investigations will
hurt the company's ability to obtain funding, it said.
    As a result of the dispute over payment of the promissory
note, the law suit challenging its financial data and the
various investigations concerning insider trading, the company
said it no longer expects that anticipated declines in
instrument sales in Japan in fiscal 1987 will be offset by
increased instrument sales in other foreign countries and the
United States.

Representatives of cocoa consuming
countries at an International Cocoa Organization, ICCO, council
meeting here have edged closer to a unified stance on buffer
stock rules, delegates said.
    While consumers do not yet have a common position, an
observer said after a consumer meeting, "They are much more
fluid ... and the tone is positive."
    European Community consumers were split on the question of
how the cocoa buffer stock should be operated when the ICCO met
in January to put the new International Cocoa Agreement into
effect, delegates said.
    At the January meeting, France sided with producers on how
the buffer stock should operate, delegates said. That meeting
ended without agreement on new buffer stock rules.
    The EC Commission met in Brussels on Friday to see whether
the 12 EC cocoa consuming nations could narrow their
differences at this month's meeting.
    The Commissioners came away from the Friday meeting with an
informal agreement to respond to signs of flexibility among
producers on the key buffer stock issues, delegates said.
    The key issues to be addressed at this council session
which divide ICCO members are whether non-member cocoa should
be eligible for buffer stock purchases and what price
differentials the buffer stock should pay for different types
of cocoa, delegates said.
    A consumer delegate said producers and consumers should be
able to compromise on the non-member cocoa question.
    A working group comprising delegates from all producing and
consuming member countries met briefly this morning, then broke
up into a producer meeting and an EC meeting, followed by a
consumer meeting.
    Producers, who are in favour of the buffer stock buying a
variety of grades of cocoa and oppose non-member cocoa being
accepted, reviewed their position ahead of the working group
meeting this afternoon.
    "We are waiting to see what consumers say," a producer
delegate said. "We hope they will be flexible or it will be
difficult to negotiate."
    The ICCO comprises 33 member countries. Non-
members include the U.S., a consumer, and Malaysia, an
increasingly important producer.

The failure of the West German government
to abolish a tax on bourse turnover when other taxes came under
discussion during recent coalition negotiations was a "bitter
disappointment," the president of the West German Federation of
Banks, Hanns Christian Schroeder-Hohenwarth, said.
    Schroeder-Hohenwarth told a news conference that, contrary
to numerous assurances from the government, the abolition of
the turnover tax had not been touched upon.
    "This must not be allowed to be the last word. Otherwise a
major chance for West Germany as a financial centre will have
been missed," he said.
    After the January 25 election the government decided upon a
reform of the West German tax system, involving gross tax cuts
of 44 billion marks, which would be implemented in 1990.
    In line with a pledge made by Bonn at the February monetary
conference in Paris, the government said earlier this month
part of the planned tax cuts would be effective next year.
    Government sources have said the fact the latest coalition
discussions did not touch upon the bourse turnover tax does not
necessarily rule out the possibility that it could be abolished
later in the current four-year legislative period.
    The bourse turnover tax, levied on securities trades where
an end-investor is involved, generated government revenue of
some 750 mln marks in 1986, according to the Finance Ministry.
    Schroeder-Hohenwarth said there were no fiscal reasons for
maintaining the tax because companies would benefit from its
abolition. Their earnings would increase and the government
would receive more in profits tax.
    Wolfgang Roeller, chief executive of Dresdner Bank AG, said
the bourse tax decision did not fit into the general background
of liberalisation of the German capital market, and represented
a weakening of West Germany as a financial centre.

External risks for the economy have
increased, but growth of two to 2.5 pct this year is still
possible, according to President of the West German Federation
of Banks, Hanns Christian Schroeder-Hohenwarth.
    Schroeder-Hohenwarth told a news conference the further
fall of the dollar since the start of this year and the
revaluation of the mark against European currencies meant West
German exporters were facing a "rough wind."
    However, domestic demand was continuing to rise and private
consumption in particular would support the economy, he said.
He saw good prospects for consumer industries.
    Schroeder-Hohenwarth said economic policy now had to
concentrate on strengthening this domestic growth. In this
context, he welcomed a decision by the government to increase
the scope of tax cuts due in 1988.
    He added, a planned reform of the fiscal system scheduled
for 1990, which was worked out by coalition partners this
month, was an "important step in the right direction."
    The government plans to cut corporation tax to 50 pct from
56 pct. However, Schroeder-Hohenwarth said the decision to cut
the maximum rate of income tax to only 53 pct from 56 pct was
"rather half-hearted."

A 0/92 program would have very
little impact on U.S. acreage, prompting farmers to idle only
an additional 3.5 mln acres of cropland every year, according
to a report from the Agriculture Department.
    The savings resulting from the additional 3.5 mln acres
idled would be a little over 400 mln dlrs in loan savings, 35
mln dlrs in transportation and storage savings, and 10-20 mln
dlrs per year in deficiency payment savings, the report said.
    The USDA report asssessed the impacts of the proposed 0/92
acreage program for wheat, corn, cotton, sorghum and barley.
Last year, almost 245 mln acres of those crops were harvested.
    "The likelihood that the 0-92 provisiion will cause very
large acreages to be removed from crop production is quite
small," the report said.
    "The returns on typical farms still favor participation in
the usual acreage reduction programs and seeding the permitted
acreage," the USDA report said.
    The 0/92 program, which would allow farmers to forego
planting and still receive 92 pct of their deficiency payment,
would be most used by producers in high production/high risk
areas where cost of production is high, said Keith Collins,
director of USDA's economics analysis staff.
    "In the heart of the corn belt, you would not get that much
participation," Collins said.
    USDA estimated that an additional one mln acres of wheat
would be ildled under 0/92, 1.5 mln acres of corn, 500,000
acres of sorghum and barley and 500,000 acres of cotton.
    Production from these idled acres would be equivalent to 40
mln bushels of wheat, 180 mln bushels of corn, 20 mln bushels
of sorghum, 10 mln bushels of barley, and 500,000 bales of
cotton, the report said.
    "In determining whether to participate, a producer would
need to weigh the expected cash costs of production against the
loan rate ... The risk that market prices may rise above the
expected levels and reduce the deficiency payment also must be
considered," according to the analysis.
    "What you're giving up under 0/92 is the difference between
the loan rate and the cost of production," Collins said.
    For producers with low production costs, that difference is
greater and can be applied to paying variable costs, he said.
Under these cicumstances, farmers would not want to go along
with 0/92. But for high cost producers, 0/92 would be more
attractive.
    Also, as loan rates get lower, Collins said there would be
more incentives to participate in a 0/92 program.
    "I would admit that its impacts would be very marginal at
first, but it is a step towards the goal of separating
production decisions from government payments," Collins said.
    In a speech earlier today before the National Grains and
Feed Association, USDA Secretary Richard Lyng said it is too
late to implement 0/92 for 1987 crops since program signup will
be over by the end of this month.

1988 earnings of 3.35 dlrs a share, up from an earlier forecast

    Caterpillar's stock was down 1/2 points at 46-1/4.
    "Although earnings will be poor for the next two quarters,
we believe that profits could begin to improve in the second
half - perhaps significantly - and should surge sharply through
1988 and 1989," he said.
    Sutliff said improved results should come from four factors
- higher prices, improved market share, reduced costs, and
improved demand.
    The higher prices will stick because its Japanese

daily expected," he said in a speech to the Industrial Society.

    Leigh-Pemberton was resuming a theme he developed in a

a company's management into action which will raise the
company's share price. The predator then withdraws, taking
substantial profits.

    For the year ended May 31, 1986, the company reported a net
loss of 1.12 dlr per share or 5.3 mln dlrs on revenues of 77.6
mln dlrs.
    Crivits said the company will report an improved but still
unprofitable third quarter ended February 28, compared to a
loss of 22 cts a share in the year-ago thrid quarter. He said
current third quarter results would be similar to 1987's
second quarter's loss of 12 cts per share.
    Crivits said the company will not produce a gain in the
fourth quarter or the full year, and said there will be a write
off in the fourth quarter for the debenture exchange offer. He
would not specify the amount of the write off.
    Robert Lamp, Consul's chief financial officer, said the
company needs to have at least 90 pct of the bonds exchanged in
the transaction to report a profit in the first quarter of
fiscal 1988. Lamp said that if the exchange is successful, the
company will report profits much higher than the three cents a
share reported in the first quarter of fiscal 1987.

<Hoechst AG's> Hoechst Celanese Corp
subsidiary said it plans to raise about 500 mln dlrs in U.S.

    Company officials, at a press conference, said the money
would be raised through the sale of debentures, adding these
securities are expected to be registered with the Securities

The federal Food and Drug
Administration's Dermatologic Drugs Advisory Committee voted
unanimously that Upjohn Co's Rogaine baldness drug was safe and
effective.
    The panel recommended that the FDA approve Rogaine for
marketing in the United States, so long as accompanying
packaging and promotional materials disclose that the product
has only limited effect on male pattern baldness.
    The five outside experts attending today's FDA committee
meeting seemed less concerned about Rogaine's safety after an
outside consultant told them the drug "appears to be quite safe
in the normal male population."
    The consultant, Ohio State University Professor of Medicine
Carl Leier, said Rogaine's side effects were minimal, based on
a study of 10,000 individuals who have been getting the drug in
Canada, where it was approved for marketing last year.
    "The Canadian record is quite a good one in terms of side
effects," Leier said.
    The experts urged the FDA to require a warning in the
drug's packaging that patients be monitored for heart effects
while taking the drug, such as irregular heart beats, changes
in heart rate, palpitations and fluid retention in the body.
    Rogaine, whose chemical name is minoxidil, has already been
approved by the FDA when taken orally as a high blood pressure
drug.
    But Upjohn is now seeking agency approval of it as a male
baldness treatment when put directly on the skin in liquid
form.
    Upjohn has previously claimed that, when applied to the
scalp, too little of Rogaine was absorbed into the bloodstream
to affect the heart.
    But panel members concluded that the amount absorbed
merited physician monitoring of patients taking the drug.
    Under questioning by panel members, Upjohn official Richard
De Villez acknowledged the drug in clinical trials produced
moderate hair growth on the crown of the head in only about 40
pct after 12 months.
    He also acknowledged discontinuing treatment would make the
new hair fall out.
    "The Upjohn problem is that they have a tremendous placebo
effect," panel member Paul Bergstresser of the University of
Texas told the meeting.
    He said patients administered a placebo during clinical
trials typically had about half as much new hair growth as did
individuals treated with Rogaine.
    As a result, it may take patients eight-12 months before
they can tell whether thay are benefiting from the drug, he
said.
    In Canada, a year's treatment costs about 550-640 dlrs
(U.S.).
    An Upjohn official said no price would be set for the drug
in the U.S. market until it was approved for sale.
    During trials, the drug was found to have a bizarre side
effect on some individuals: It caused a state of sexual
dysfunction known as "exagerrated erection."
    Stewart Ehrreich, a former FDA official who conducted a
safety review of Rogaine before leaving the agency, said
researchers had found a number of cases of patients who had
exagerrated erections as a result of the drug.
    He said this was a common effect for drugs of the same
class as Rogaine, called vaso-dilators.
    FDA officials said they could make no prediction on when
Rogaine might be approved for marketing.
    Following the vote, panel member Dr. Robert Stern, a Boston
dermatologist, said Upjohn statistics had exaggerated the
effect of the drug.
    He said "about one in five will have a substantial clinical
effect," which he defined as a significant growth of new hair
that made the patient actually look better.
    He urged insurance companies not to cover the cost of
Rogaine treatment in order to preserve scarce medical fund
resources.
    "I would hope that insurance companies will take a strong
line that this is not a product we will reimburse for," Stern
told reporters.
    "I think this is a drug that has some application for some
people, and I think some people will find it worth the expense,"
he said.
    But he said individuals should be required to pay for the
treatment out of their personal funds.
    Stern estimated more than 100,000 American men are already
using minoxidil on their scalps, outside the law, by grinding
up the blood pressure pill and dissolving in a solvent.

France's state-owned Aerospatiale is
working on designs for a hypersonic plane to fly 150 passengers
at five times the speed of sound, and plans to unveil computer
studies at the Paris air show in June, a company spokesman
said.
    The plane, which is similar in concept to the Orient
Express project announced by President Reagan last year, would
have four ram-jet motors, lacking the moving parts of
conventional turbo-jet engines, and each having 30 tonnes of
thrust.
    It would cruise at an altitude of up to 30,000 metres,
around three times higher than conventional aircraft and nearly
twice as high as the Anglo-French Concorde supersonic jet.
    With a range of 12,000 km it would be capable of flying
from Paris to New York in one hour, compared with three hours
taken by Concorde, and Paris to Tokyo in two hours.
    The aircraft could reach speeds in excess of 5,000 km an
hour.
    The Aerospatiale spokesman said its research scientists had
been working on the project for about two years, drawing on the
experience it gained from Concorde as well as experience in
heat-resistant materials needed on high-speed aircraft which it
has developed from building French nuclear missiles.

The market in floating rate notes showed
no clear signs of recovery today from the confusion which sent
prices tumbling and paralysed trading at the end of last week,
dealers and bank officials said.
    FRN dealers said at least 10 houses did not open for
business with many market operators pausing to assess their
next steps in the wake of Friday's huge drops and panic
trading.
    Despite some late signs that prices were recovering last
week, today's erratic trade provided a similarly mixed final
picture with longer-dated FRNs still clearly under pressure.
    While FRN specialists noted that paper on which coupons are
shortly due to be refixed had managed to hold up today, as had
notes paying a relatively higher margin, longer term FRNs were
still subject to intense selling pressure.
    "Anything longer than 10 years is still being sold off
seriously, as is just about any paper in the banking sector,"
one FRN market source at a leading U.S. House said.
    He noted that one long-dated Citicorp issue -- paper which
has suffered recently on fears over Latin American debt
exposure -- slipped by two points to around 94.00. FRNs, whose
coupons are refixed regularly, usually trade around par.
    U.S. And Canadian bank paper was still generally under
pressure, as was Republic of Ireland paper, due to renewed
worries about the Irish economic situation.
    The malaise was felt through the banking sector with a two
point fall registered by one BNP note, to give a three point
drop over two trading days.
    Retail clients, usually seen returning to the market as
price falls push yield margins up to these attractive levels,
have been unnerved by the last three days' panic, dealers said.
    "Yes, there's been some bargain hunting, but no one dares to
be first to come seriously back in," said one dealer.
    "A handful of market giants have frightened the retail away
with this aggressive manipulation. As true liquidity drains, we
are going to have to see some better market cooperation and
rationalisation," commented one FRN trader now dealing with
straight bond issues since the floater market crisis.

    But the group, acting through Clevebaco L.P., a Cleveland

increase its stake. Lerner owns Clevebaco Corp, which is the

    If the Fed approves, Lerner, whose Equitable Bancorp is

stock, subject to market conditions and other factors.

U.S. drilling activity fell last week,
with the number of active rotary rigs dropping by five to 761,
against 1,137 working rigs one year ago, Hughes Tool Co said.
    The drilling rig count, which historically falls during the
first quarter of each year, has dropped steadily since early
January when a total of 962 rotary rigs were working. Hughes
economist Ike Kerridge said the U.S. rig count was expected to
fall to a about 700 working rigs by mid-April.
    "I think we're pretty much on track with the expectation
that the seasonal low will come in late March or early April,"
he said. "We're getting close to the bottom."
   Among individual states, Texas and Oklahoma reported gains
in drilling activity last week, with increases of 21 and 13,
respectively. Kerridge attributed the jump in activity to the
likelihood that many of the rigs were omitted from the previous
week's count because they were in transit or being prepared for
work. In the week ended March 9, the rig count for Texas and
Oklahoma fell by 23 and 13, respectively.
    Other states reported slight decreases in drilling activity
last week, Hughes said. Wyoming and Louisiana were down by six,
Kansas and Colorado lost four and Michigan and West Virginia
were down by three rigs.
    Most of the week's decrease came among rigs used for
onshore drilling, which dropped to a total of 669 from last
week's 671. A total of 74 rigs were active offshore and 1 were
working in inland waters during the week, Hughes Tool said.
    In Canada, the rig count was up 1 to 181, against 367 one
year ago.

U.S. lawmakers are gearing up for a
showdown between protectionists and free traders as a major
trade bill winds its way through committees to a vote by the
full House of Representatives in late April.
    In a move to toughen U.S. enforcement of trade laws, a key
House subcommittee last week approved a toned-down version of
legislation to require President Reagan to retaliate against
foreign countries that follow unfair trade practices.
    The bill will be the cornerstone of congressional efforts
to restore competitiveness of American industries and turn
around last year's record 169 billion dlrs trade deficit.
    Generally, the bill's provisions toughen U.S. enforcement
of trade laws.
    The trade bill forces the administration to act rapidly on
complaints of unfair trade practices, such as dumping products
in the United States at prices below cost of production. It
also forces the administration to act rapidly when an industry
complains that a surge in imports threatens its existence.
    In writing the bill, the subcommittee rejected calls for
trade relief for specific industries such as textiles.
    Several lawmakers have argued the new trade bill made too
many concessions to Reagan and said they intend to back
amendments to "get tough" with countries that violate trade
agreements or keep out U.S. products.
    But congressmen known for their allegiance to free trade
said the bill ties Reagan's hands too much in trade disputes
and they will seek to restore his negotiating powers.
    Bill Frenzel, R-MI., said the subcommittee's bill was not
one "that a free trader like me could endorse in all respects,"
but he emphasized there was a consensus among lawmakers to work
toward a bill Reagan and Republicans would ultimately endorse.
    The goal of trade legislation was "to make our trade policy
stronger without violating our international trade agreements,"
he said.
    In a key concession made at the urging of Ways and Means
Committee chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-IL., the trade
subcommittee backed off a requirement that would have forced
Reagan to impose automatically quotas or tariffs on imports
from countries that engage in unfair trade practices.
    It also agreed the president may waive any retaliation if
it would hurt the U.S. economy.
    Rostenkowski insisted the more moderate approach was
necessary if the House wanted to pass a bill Reagan would sign
into law.
    Reagan last year blocked Senate consideration of a tough
House trade bill he branded as protectionist and this year he
only reluctantly agreed to support a trade bill when he saw
Democratic leaders were determined to pass such legislation.
    White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters late
last week that the administration still did not like some of
the bill's provisions, but he added, "Generally we feel very
good about the bipartisan consideration of the trade
legislation. I think we are progressing very well."
    The first battle will take place next week when the full
House Ways and Means Committee considers an amendment by Rep.
Richard Gephardt, D-MO., to force countries like Japan, South
Korea and Taiwan to cut their trade surpluses with the U.S.
    The subcommittee limited the Gephardt plan to provide only
that the existence of a large trade surplus with the United
States will trigger an investigation of unfair trade practices,
but would not automatically set off retaliation.
    Organized labor has pressed lawmakers for more relief from
imports where jobs have been lost to foreign competition.
    AFL-CIO president Lane Kirkland this year angered the
administration when he said any trade bill Reagan would sign
would not be worth passage in Congress.
    But Rostenkowski set the tone of the trade debate by
saying, "I'm not trying to write legislation to please Lane
Kirkland. I'm trying to write legislation that will be signed
by the president."
    Rep. Ed Jenkins (D-GA.) intends to push separately a bill
to protect the domestic textile and shoe industry, an aide
said. Reagan vetoed a similar measure last year.
    House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas, one of the most
influential proponents of aid for specific industries beset by
low-priced foreign competition, last week renewed his call for
import relief for the domestic oil industry and announced his
support for a Senate plan to trigger a temporary oil import
tariff when imports reach half of domestic consumption.

New Nebraska Republican Senator
David Karnes said he supports proposals to "decouple" farm
subsidies from production decisions.
    Karnes, formerly a vice president of Scoular Grain Co. in
Omaha, was appointed last week to complete the term of the late
Sen. Edward Zorinsky (D-Nebr.).
    On target prices, Karnes said he believes the gradual
reductions in supports included in the 1985 farm bill should be
continued, but administration proposals for 10 pct cuts in
target prices each year are "excessive."
    Karnes said he opposes mandatory production controls for
major crops. His predecessor, Sen. Zorinsky, had supported
mandatory controls for wheat and was the author of a farm bill
provision requiring a referendum on the subject last year.
    Sen. Karnes accompanied Sen. Rudy Boschwitz (R-Minn.) to

American Telephone and Telegraph Co
may have a hard time convincing U.S. regulatory authorities
that lifting controls on its long-distance business will
benefit consumers, industry and congressional analysts say.
    "There's clearly going to have to be an effort (by ATT) to
say that deregulation will not have an adverse effect on the
consumer," said Gerry Salemme, a policy analyst for the House
telecommunications, consumer protection and finance
subcommittee.
    Salemme said that if the Federal Communications Commission
eased restrictions on ATT, Congress probably would consider
taking legislative oversight action to protect consumers'
interests.
    ATT has about 80 pct of the interstate long-distance
market. It asked the FCC to cut back price and rate regulations
that have control its long-distance phone business.
    ATT spun off its local telephone services operations into
the seven regional Bell companies in 1984 as part of the  court
ordered breakup of the telephone giant.
    The regional companies have been prohibited from
manufacturing equipment and from offering information services
and out-of-region long-distance service.
    But some of them want to move into those areas,
particularly the provision of long-distance services, which
would compete directly with ATT.
    ATT's request came in response to an FCC notice issued in
January that proposed to streamline regulation of certain parts
of its long-distance business.
    The FCC will closely examine the potential effects of the
proposal on consumers, said FCC spokeswoman Mary Beth Hess.
    "That would be foremost in our mind," Hess said.
    Hess said she expected the FCC to respond in a few months.
    Congressional aides said they were concerned that if
regulation is reduced, ATT will use its dominant market
position to raise consumer rates.
    Consumer groups say ATT's concern for its business clients,
its most lucrative market, underscores a danger that, without
full regulation from the FCC, any increased costs will be
passed onto the consumer rather than big business.
    ATT, however, says deregulation would benefit consumers.
    The company would become more competitive because it would
not have to wait for FCC authorization before introducing new
services, spokeswoman Edith Herman said.
    However, Gene Kimmelman of the Consumer Federation of
America, which represents more than 200 consumer groups
nationally, said, "When ATT offers new services, they tend to be
geared toward the high volume business market rather than the
average consumer."
    ATT proposed that in addition to lifting profit regulation,
the FCC allow new rates to go into effect in 14 days instead of
the current 45 days.
    The company also called for a reduction in the amount of
documentation it must file with the FCC each time it introduces
or changes long-distance services.
    "With this filing, we're suggesting that regulators replace
a blanket approach to regulating ATT with a more finely-tuned,
targeted approach," said Lawrence Garfinkel, AT&T's vice
president of marketing services, in a statement.
    "We believe that by using a scalpel instead of a meat axe,
the public interest can be protected and all consumers will
benefit," he added.
    MCI Communications Corp, also asked the FCC to ease
restrictions on ATT, saying this would encourage competition.
    Some industry analysts said the MCI proposal was an effort
to halt FCC-mandated price cuts that have forced ATT and its
rivals to cut prices, eroding profits in the industry. MCI lost
448.4 mln dlrs on sales of 3.59 billion dlrs last year.
    The analysts said the proposal would benefit MCI because
ATT would no longer impose price cuts that MCI would have to
follow when costs fell in the industry.
    "I'm sort of mystified by those comments," retorted Herman, a
district manager for ATT.
    "ATT (if deregulated) has no intention of not passing on
cost reductions," she added.
    Kimmelman, legislative director of the Consumer Federation,
said he opposed deregulation because it left no alternatives
that would ensure against overcharging by ATT.
    He said the FCC had in the past instructed ATT to reduce
prices when the company was benefitting from lower costs from
increased use by consumers of long-distance services.
    Without full regulatory authority this may no longer
happen, he added.

The Securities and Exchange
Commission approved a request by two firms controlled by inside
trader Ivan Boesky that allows them to take steps to protect
hundreds of millions of dollars from potential claimants.
    The SEC granted requests made by Seemala Partners L.P. and
IFB Managing Partnership L.P., to withdraw as registered
brokers, effective March 12.
    With the action, the partnerships are no longer subject to
the SEC's net capital rules requiring them to remain solvent as
brokerage firms. Seemala argued the move would be necessary if
noteholders of Ivan Boesky and Co L.P. are to be repaid.
    In asking the SEC to speed its withdrawal as a registered
broker, Seemala said it wold repay to Boesky and Co, which is
also controlled by the former Wall Street arbitrageur, 660 mln
dlrs in subordinated debt, plus accrued interest.
    IFB Managing Partners, which was also given approval to
withdraw as a broker, has no significant assets, the SEC said.
    Once it is repaid, Boesky and Co will pay 200 mln dlrs in
senior participating notes and 440 mln dlrs in subordinated
participating notes of Hudson Funding Corp to certain
noteholders, Seemala told the SEC.
    Under the planned repayment scheme, Seemala told the SEC
the noteholders would forgo claims of prepayment penalties and
some additional interest amounting to more than 100 mln dlrs.
    The plan would be in the public interest, Seemala argued,
since the noteholders, many of which are savings and loan
institutions and insurance companies, would receive repayment
of the principal on their notes.
    Seemala also argued that the plan would help the limited
partners of Boesky and Co, who were not charged in the Boesky
insider trading scandal, by protecting its remaining equity
from the noteholders' claims.
    Unless the Boesky firms are allowed to complete the
repayment plan, Seemala said Boesky and Co noteholders would
seek total claims of 116.8 mln dlrs, plus 9.2 mln dlrs to 10.6
mln dlrs a month in addition, in addition to other claims.
    Such claims could wipe out Boesky and Co's assets before
other creditors can establish their claims, Seemala said.
    The only opposition to Seemala's Feb 12 request to withdraw
as a broker came from Berger and Montague P.C., counsel for the
plaintiffs in a class action suit against Seemala and other
defendants. The suit involves charges stemming from Boesky's
insider trading in the stock of several major companies.
    Berger and Montague told the SEC it opposes the Seemala
proposal because it would allow Boesky and Co noteholders to
settle their claims ahead of the plaintiffs in the class action
and because Seemala did not disclose the total amount of claims
against it and what percentage defrauded investors would get.
    Seemala has said that its repayment scheme would leave a
pool of about 278 mln dlrs free of claims from Boesky and Co
noteholders which could satisfy other claimants.
    The pool would be in addition to funds placed in escrow
under insider trading settlement agreements, including 11.4 mln
dlrs from Dennis Levine and 50 mln dlrs from Boesky.
    In approving the request, the SEC barred Seemala and Boesky
and Co from making any distributions to its limited partners
for one year and required limited partners who receive
distributions to agree to make themselves liabile up to a point
in any case filed the partnerships.
    The SEC also required Seemala and Boesky and Co to get
confirmation of their assets from a nationally recognized
accounting firm.
    The agency said Boesky and Co and existing and potential
claimants against it have similar interests in eliminating
major creditors and preserving assets for future claims.

The International Cocoa Organization,
ICCO, council adjourned after presenting divergent producer and

draft compromise proposal on the buffer stock issue tomorrow,
delegates said.
    ICCO Executive Director Kobena Erbynn will draw up what
some delegates called a "pre-compromise" and present it to the
buffer stock working group at 1130 hrs GMT Tuesday, they said.
    While consumer and producer member nations disagree how a
buffer stock should be implemented, both sides reiterated they
were willing to compromise to come to agreement, they said.
    "I am optimistic we will be able to come to an agreement --
maybe not tomorrow or the next day, but some time later in the
session," a consumer delegate said.
    Producers say they want the buffer stock to consist only of
ICCO member cocoa, comprise a representative basket of various
grade cocoas and pay different prices for different grades,
delegates said.
    Some consumers would rather the buffer stock manager be
able to buy non-member cocoa also, and pay a single price for
the buffer stock cocoa without respect to origin.
    Consumer members were not unified in their views on how the
buffer stock should operate, with several countries backing
different aspects of the producer stance, delegates said.
    The semi-annual council meeting is scheduled to run until
March 27. Consideration of the buffer stock rules is the most
controversial topic on the agenda, delegates said.

disclosing imbalances in market-on-close orders in 50 major
stocks thirty minutes prior to the close of trading Friday.
    The procedure will be followed this Friday when stock index
futures and options and individual stock options expire
simultaneously. Such triple expirations occur four times a year
and in the past have been associated with big swings in stock
market averages. In a new variation of the disclosure rules,
the NYSE said no market-on-close orders related to index
arbitrage can be entered after 1530 EST.
    The NYSE said all market-on-close orders for 50 big

The NYSE will then furnish to financial news services any
imbalance in market-on-close orders of 10,000 shares or more.
    After 1530 EST market-on-close orders in the 50 stocks can
be entered only on the opposite side of the imbalance. But the
bar on entering market-on-close orders related to index
arbitrage after 1530 EST is a new element of the disclosure
plan, which has the goal of making the market less volatile

The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, CME,
and the Chicago Board Options Exchange, CBOE, announced today
that they will trade futures and options, respectively, on an
index of international securities compiled by Morgan Stanley
Group Inc.
    Morgan Stanley said it has agreed to license the exchanges
to use the Morgan Stanley Capital International Europe,
Australia and Far East, or EAFE, stock index as the trading
basis.
    The EAFE index is comprised of 900 international stocks
from 16 nations in Europe, the Far East, and Australia.
    "The EAFE is the only instrument by which world markets are
measured," CME special counsel Leo Melamed said at a news
conference announcing the agreement.
    CME Chairman Jack Sandner noted that one-third of the
exchange's daily trading volume now derives from overseas.
    "The success of our index markets, particularly the S and P
index, is ample precedent to forging ahead" in international
markets, he said.
    Mark Sladkus, publisher of Morgan Stanley Capital
International Perspective, said Japanese bank stocks represent
the largest portion of the index.
    The officials said the exchanges have not yet submitted the
EAFE index to the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
Commodities Futures Trading Commission for approval.
    However, Melamed said approval is not expected to be
granted quickly, and the exchanges did not set a starting date
for the new contracts.
    The EAFE index is tabulated daily, but Sladkus said
real-time calculation will be introduced when trading begins.
    The conflicting opening and closing of international
securities markets will have to be accommodated in the
calculations, he noted.
    Morgan Stanley has been calculating the EAFE index weekly
since 1970 and daily since 1972.
    The CME and CBOE will negotiate with a third party to be
"an independent monitor ... the guardian" of the index, Melamed
said. "Morgan will remove itself from deciding which stocks
move in and out of the index."

U.S. money managers and investment
advisors said they expect stocks to continue to outperform
bonds, but some are hedging bets by keeping roughly half of
portfolios in bonds and cash for quick investment shifts.
    Merrill Lynch said its new asset mix report due today will
urge weightings of 50 pct stock, 35 pct bonds and 15 pct cash
versus 40 pct bonds, 35 pct stock and 25 pct cash previously.
    "We believe an overweighting in stocks is warranted because
of the positive momentum of corporate earnings," said Christine
Lisec-Tinto, Merrill senior investment strategist.
    Lisec-Tinto, who formulated Merrill's latest asset mix
recommendations with new chief investment strategist Charles
Clough, said there may be some consolidation of recent stock
price gains, but the market appears to have good potential.

potential than the bond market," Chrysler Corp <C> treasurer

Schlumberger Ltd said it terminated an
agreement in principle for Fujitsu Ltd to buy 80 pct of its
Fairchild Semiconductor operations.
    The company said the rising political controversy in the
U.S. concerning the venture made it unlikely that the sale of
the Fairchild stake could be completed within a reasonable
time.
    The sale has been opposed by the U.S. Commerce Department
and the U.S. Defense Department, in part on national security
grounds.
    The company said termination of the agreement opened other
possibilities, including a possible leveraged buyout of the
semiconductor maker by Fairchild management.
    In the interim, Fairchild would continue its ongoing
business within Schlumberger, the oilfield services concern
said.
    Last October, Schlumberger announced the sale of the
Fairchild stake and said it would take a 200 mln dlrs charge in
the fourth quarter from the sale. The company ended up
recording special charges of 2.1 billion dlrs in the fourth
quarter, leading to a loss of 2.02 billion dlrs for the year.
    Schlumberger never announced a price for the sale, but
industry analysts have estimated the value of the deal at about
200 mln dlrs.
    The proposed sale was under antitrust review by the U.S.
Justice Department. Additionally, Commerce Secretary Malcolm
Baldridge and other U.S. officials have voiced reservations
about the transaction since it was announced.
    Government officials have expressed concern that the sale
could reduce the competitiveness of U.S. chip makers by putting
key advanced technology into Japanese hands.
    New, high-technology semiconductors are used in
supercomputers, which are faster and more powerful than
existing computers.

The Senate budget committee sits
down tomorrow to start drafting a fiscal 1988 budget, with the
budget writers expected to look at several proposals for fuel
taxes and other tax options to cut the budget.
    In a briefing book for the drafting sessions, a number of
revenue raising tax options are proposed, including a five dlrs
a barrel fee on domestic and imported oil, a fee just on
imported oil, and a broad based tax on domestic energy
consumption based on five pct of value.
    Other proposals include various excise taxes and
combinations of import surcharges or tariffs, including a 10
pct import across the board import surcharge that would raise
22 billion dlrs next year alone, more in later years.
    The committee, however, will only include revenue numbers
in its proposed budget with the actual revenue decisions left
to the House and Senate tax-writing committees.
     The committee will draft a budget which its chairman, Sen
Lawton Chiles, a Florida Democrat, said he hopes would raise at
least 18 billion dlrs in revenues, or about half the minimum 36
billion dlr deficit reduction he has in mind.
    The House Budget Committee also plans to start drafting a
separate budget plan later this week, which would have to be
reconciled with the Senate version. The final budget would be
the fiscal 1988 spending and revenue blueprint.

Schlumberger Ltd most likely has an
alternate buyer lined up for its Fairchild Semiconductor unit,
Wall Street analysts said.
    "I think its clear that in cancelling its agreement with
Fujitsu, Schlumberger has signaled that it has another deal in
the works," said Paul Johnson, a semiconductor analyst with
L.F. Rothschild.
    "There are unquestionably other buyers out there," added
Kidder Peabody analyst Adam F. Cuhney. "A lot of companies have
looked at Fairchild and would be willing to buy it."
    Among the companies that would be interested in bidding for
Fairchild are Advanced Micro Devices <AMD>, Sunnyvale, Calif.,
and LSI Logic Corp <LLSI>, Milpitas, Calif., industry analysts
said.
    Top U.S. chipmakers like National Semiconductor Corp <NSM>,
Texas Instruments Inc <TXN> and Motorola Inc <MOT> might also
seek to buy Fairchild, but could possibly run into antitrust
problems, the analysts added.
    Moreover, Fairchild's management is thought to be
considering proposing a leveraged buyout of the Cupertino,
Calif., company, analysts said.
    In a brief statement announcing the termination of the
agreement with Fujitsu, Schlumberger said the decision opened
up other possibilities, including a possible buyout by
Fairchild management.
    The company said it ended the deal, in which Fujitsu would
have bought 80 pct of Fairchild for an estimated 200 mln dlrs,
because rising opposition to the deal by the Reagan
administration made it unlikely that the sale could be
completed within a reasonable period of time.
    Analysts questioned this explanation, however, arguing that
the companies did not need government approval to complete the
transaction. Both Schlumberger and Fujitsu are foreigned-owned
companies.
    "Schlumberger would not have terminated the deal because
the U.S. government didn't want it," said Johnson of L.F.
Rothschild.
    A spokesman for Schlumberger declined to elaborate on the
company's news release.
    He said only that the company was reviewing a number of
possible alternatives for the Fairchild unit.
    Officials at Fairchild and Fujitsu were not immediately
available for comment.
    Analysts noted the significance of the government's
apparent success in preventing Fujitsu from taking control of
Fairchild.
    Administration officials, including Commerce Secretary
Malcolm Baldrige and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger,
feared that the sale to Fujitsu would lead to Japanese control
of key semiconductor technology for supercomputers and military
weapons systems.
    "The government really stood up for the semiconductor
industry," said Johnson of L.F. Rothschild. "That, I think, is
the real significance of this."
    Consequently, analysts said, the Japanese government might
now feel more pressure to address U.S. complaints about
Japanese chipmakers' violation of the semiconductor trade
agreement signed last summer.

The United Auto Workers denied a

prime target in its upcoming contract talks with the auto

    A UAW spokesman called "premature" a press report that the

company in talks expected to begin in mid to late July.
    Earlier, the Detroit Free Press, quoting local union
officials, said Ford would probably be picked as the auto
company to set the pattern for a negotiated settlement with the
entire U.S. car industry.
    According to the report, the fact that Ford earned more
money last year than GM will cause the union to select Ford as
the company with which the union will negotiate the
pattern-setting settlement.
    The UAW traditionally picks one of the major car companies
in its national contract talks with the auto industry, which

Corporate raider Carl Icahn
acknowledged that he is one of the targets of an investigation
by the Securities and Exchange Commission into possible
violations of securities laws.
    Icahn, who heads and controls Trans World Airlines Inc
<TWA>, made the acknowledgement in a filing TWA was required to
make with the SEC disclosing its 14.8 pct stake in USAir Group.
    The SEC issued a formal order launching the private
investigation on Nov 12, 1986, Icahn said in the SEC filing.
    The order empowers SEC investigators to try to find out
whether any persons, including Icahn, violated securities laws
and related rules, Icahn said.
    Specifically, the probe is examining the acquisition and
subsequent sale of more than five pct of the stock of certain
unspecified companies, he said.
    Federal law requires individuals or groups of individuals
who have made shareholder agreements, to disclose stakes in
companies of at least five pct within 10 days.
    Icahn has acknowledged that he has been subpoenaed in
connection with SEC probes, but this is the first time he has
disclosed that he is among those being investigated.
    By making the disclosure in a filing with the SEC, which is
obviously already aware of its own probe, Icahn was also
alerting current and potential shareholders of TWA.
    It is not uncommon for companies which are aware that they
or their officers are the targets of government probes to
acknowledge the existence of the otherwise secret
investigations to fulfill their legal disclosure requirements
to their shareholders.
    Icahn said the SEC is looking into whether he and others
whom he did not name violated securities laws by acquiring and
selling more than five pct of a company's stock.
    SEC investigations into those kinds of possible securities
law violations have been spawned by the agency's widening probe
into the Wall Street insider trading scandal, according to
published reports.
    Making late filings of 13D forms, which disclose the amount
of stock over five pct an investor has in a company, or making
no filing at all could indicate a scheme to "warehouse" shares
of stock.
    In a warehousing scheme, a group of investors acting in
concert would each amass stock in the company without
disclosing that they have an agreement among them.
    By failing to disclose that they are acting together the
market is unware of the amount of stock of a company that is
controlled by a group acting in concert.
    Last year, the SEC charged members of the wealthy Belzberg
family of Canada with taking part in a warehousing scheme while
it was accumulating stock in Ashland Oil Inc.

SmithKline Beckman Corp said it is
pursuing a three-point stragey that will achieve a 10 pct
annual increase in operating earnings throughout the remainder
of the decade.
    In 1986, SmithKline earned 521.1 mln dlrs or 6.78 dlrs per
share on revenues of 3.6 billion dlrs.
    The company said in its annual report that its
nonpharmaceutical business will play a major role in meeting
its earnings growth target, and will in fact grow faster than
its pharmaceutical business.
    SmithKline, whose major product is the antiulcer medication
Tagamet, said in the report that it intends to improve earnings
from existing products, expand its product portfolio and
optimize its financial resources.
    To bolster its position in the antiulcer market, in which
Tagamet has met stiff competition, SmithKline said its strategy
to develop an over-the-counter version of Tagamet is bolstered
by two joint ventures, one with <Wellcome PLC>, and one pending
venture in Japan.
    SmithKline also said its Allergan Inc eye and skin care
products division can be a one billion dlr organization in the
next five years that can grow at more than seven to 10 pct
annually.
    "Nondilutive acquisitions are a real possibility," Gavin
Herbert, president of the eye and skin care product group said
in the report. In 1986, Allergan had worldwide sales of 433 mln
dlrs.
    It said its Smith Kline and French Laboratories
pharmaceuticals unit, with 1986 sales of 1.9 billion dlrs, will
file for Food and Drug Administration marketing approval for a
number of cardiovascular agents, including tissue plasminogen
activator, over the next two years.
    It also said SK and F's U.S. sales force will be 20 pct
larger in 1987, with more than 1,000 sales personnel.
    Smith Kline also said its small clinical laboratory testing
unit, with 1986 sales of 373 mln dlrs, performs 24 mln tests a
year, and sees increases in employee drug testing as well as in
testing for the AIDS antibody.
    Smith Kline said that depending on its share price and the
cost of money, it may buy back more shares. In the last three
years, it has bought back about 25 pct of its shares.
    SmithKline begins the year with a new management team,
including its new chief operating officer George Ebright.

this gain will be sufficient to offset the expected operating

In what may easily be the largest
initial public offering in U.S. history, Consolidated Rail Corp
estimated that the sale of its 59 mln government-owned shares
could earn the freight railroad as much as 1.7 billion dlrs.
    In an amended registration statement filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, Conrail said its public
offering could come as early as next week and estimated its
shares will sell for between 26 and 29 dlrs each, slightly
higher than Conrail's initial prospectus had anticipated.
    A sale in this price range would net between 1.53 billion
dlrs and 1.7 billion dlrs for Conrail's 58.8 mln shares, with
52 million sold in North American and the remainder for sale in
an international offering.
    The previous largest initial U.S. public offering occurred
last May when the Henley Group Inc., a diverse collection of 38
companies spun off by Allied-Signal Corp, raised 1.19 billion
dlrs.
    In its initial prospecus filed with the SEC, Conrail had
estimated its government-owned shares would fetch only 22 to 26
dlrs a share, or a maximum of 1.52 billion dlrs.
    "We cannot comment on any question," said a spokesman for
Goldman Sachs and Co., one of the co-managers of the selling
syndicate. "The SEC is being extremely cautious," he said.
   Conrail was created by the government in the mid-1970s from
the bankrupt Penn Central Railroad and six other bankrupt or
failing Northeast railroads. After several years of large
losses, the railroad company turned its first profit in 1981.
    Last year Conrail earned 431 mln dlrs on revenues of 3.14
billion dlrs, down slightly from its 1985 profit of 442 mln
dlrs on revenues of 3.21 billion dlrs.
    Conrail operated its last passenger service in 1982.

public sale of Conrail set two billion dlrs as a target to be

major deterrents to First Interstate Bancorp's <I> take over
bid, which it withdrew on February 9.
    Since then, banking analysts have speculated BankAmerica

    TransAmerica, a privately held company that has been in

its chairman, Oscar S. Wyatt Jr, unlawfully interfered with
agreements it previously reached with its creditors, causing
the company significant damage.
    TransAmerica also said its suit, filed in state district
court in Harris County, Texas, seeks injunctions against Wyatt
and Coastal to enjoin them from interfering with its
contractual agreements with its creditors.
    The company alleged that beginning in mid-1986, Coastal and
its chairman took various steps to acquire its gas and other
assets.
    Coastal has used TransAmerica's bankruptcy proceedings to
engineer a hostile takeover attempt, the company charged.
    In its suit TransAmerican alleged that Coastal and Wyatt
are "notorious corporate raiders who have been restrained in
the past from taking over other corporations in their attempt
to create a stranglehold position from which they could control
and raise gas prices..."
    "It is obvious that Coastal's efforts to improperly take
over TransAmerican is a thinly veiled attempt to control a
larger share of the Texas gas market to the detriment of end

    The Japanese press has reported that Kanemaru proposed

Japan's overall wholesale price index
(base 1980) fell 0.1 pct in February from a month earlier to
86.4 for the second consecutive month-on-month fall, the Bank
of Japan said.
    Wholesale prices fell 0.6 pct in January from December.
    The index fell 9.1 pct from a year earlier for the 21st
straight year-on-year drop, the central bank said.
    The reduced month-on-month drop mainly stemmed from the
recovery in world crude oil prices, it said.
    On a customs-cleared basis, crude oil prices rose to around
17 dlrs a barrel in February from about 15 dlrs in January.
    The average value of the yen against the dollar rose 0.8
pct to 153.50 in February from 154.67 in January and was up
16.8 pct from 184.55 a year earlier, the bank said.
    The export price index in February fell 0.7 pct from a
month earlier reflecting price cuts in export products like
cars and precision instruments due to severe foreign
competition. The index was down 7.1 pct from a year earlier.
    The import price index rose 1.1 pct from a month earlier to
57.4 for the sixth successive month-on-month gain mainly due to
the continued strength of world crude oil prices. But the index
was down 29 pct from a year earlier.
    The domestic price index fell 0.1 pct to 91.9 in February,
its 24th straight monthly drop, mainly reflecting falls in
prices of home appliances such as colour televisions due to
severe sales competition at home. Lower edible oil prices added
to the decline.
    The index was down 6.7 pct from a year earlier.
    The domestic index marked its largest year-on-year drop of
7.1 pct in January since the central bank started compiling
such statistics in 1960 under its current system.
    Wholesale prices are likely to turn upward in March as
higher world crude oil and raw material prices are expected,
the bank said.

    Subject to Ministry of International Trade and Industry
approval, the Exchange will add a sixth session starting at
1700 local time, and will close the account for trading at the
new session the following day before the opening call starts at
0930 local time, an Exchange official said.
    Trading on the Singapore rubber market, a major producer
price indicator for Japanese end-users, is usually active after
the end of the current final session here.
    The introduction of the new session will enable
participants to trade overnight after taking account of
Singapore rubber prices, because brokers and members who are
designated by the Kobe Exchange are allowed to add the volume
traded overnight to the new final session before the opening
session starts next day, the official said.
    But because the Kobe Exchange uses the auction system which
sets a fixed price at each session, the price of contracts
traded overnight should be a fixed price settled at the sixth
session, he added.
    Industry sources said they expected the Ministry to approve
the plan because it has encouraged the Japanese futures
industry to expand and internationalise.
    The Tokyo Commodity Exchange for Industry, TOCOM, which
also trades rubber futures in Japan, said it has no plans to

Coastal Corp said a federal bankruptcy
court will hear its request today for a restraining order to
stop a two billion dlr lawsuit against it by <TransAmerican
Natural Gas Corp>.
    TransAmerican, which entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy
proceedings in 1983 to reorganise its debts, filed the lawsuit
to block Coastal from taking control.
    Coastal spokesman Jim Bailey confirmed the company, which
is an unsecured creditor of TransAmerican, would present its
own reorganisation plan to the bankruptcy court.
    Under the plan, Coastal would buy the natural gas reserves
and pipeline system owned by TransAmerican in Texas for an
undisclosed amount.
    TransAmerican lawyer John Nabors said the company values
its total assets, including an unused oil refinery, at about
one billion dlrs.
    The company, the second-largest natural gas producer in
Texas, said it has gas reserves of 1.2 trillion cubic feet and
over 1,000 miles of pipeline and gas gathering lines.
    About 80 pct of TransAmerican's gas is available for spot
market sales in Texas during peak demand, it said.
    Nabors said the TransAmerican reorganisation would repay
its 770 mln dlr debt with profits from natural gas sales. The
lawsuit seeks one billion dlrs in actual damages and one
billion in punitive damages from Coastal.
    Coastal has been trying to break into the Texas gas market
since 1979, when it was forced to sell <Lo-Vaca Gas Gathering
Co> to settle over 1.6 billion dlrs in lawsuits by Texas
customers facing abrupt curtailment of supply.
    Coastal, a natural gas producer and pipeline company,
earned 71.6 mln dlrs on sales of 6.7 billion in 1986, about
half the its 1985 profits, due to slumping energy prices.

A government study has concluded the
U.S. Will be dependent on oil from the middle east into the
next century and must take steps to reduce its vulnerability,
the New York Times said.
    The newspaper said the inter-agency government study found
a serious oil-dependency problem due to steadily falling
domestic production and rising demand for imported oil.
    The study concluded that by 1995 the U.S. Will be relying
on foreign countries for 50 pct of its oil, more than the peak
of 48 pct reached in 1977 and far above the 33 pct rate during
the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo.
    The U.S. Now imports about 38 pct of its oil needs, up from
27 pct a year ago, the New York Times said.
    It said recommendations sent to the White House by Energy
Secretary John Harrington include financial incentives to raise
domestic oil production by one mln barrels a day from the
current 8.4 mln barrels.
    The newspaper said the administration has placed increased
emphasis on stockpiling oil reserves. It said the view now held
is that the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to be tapped in times
of shortages, should be increased by 100,000 barrels a day,
rather than 35,000 as called for in the 1988 budget.
   The newspaper said Harrington may propose restoring the
depletion allowance to major producers.
    "The administration also plans to renew its efforts to
...Repeal the windfall profits tax, remove bars to drilling on
the outer continental shelf and repeal the law that limits the
use of natural gas in industrial and utility boilers," it added.

Japan's gross national product (GNP) rose
a real 0.8 pct in the October/December quarter after an
upwardly revised 0.7 pct increase the previous three months,
the Economic Planning Agency (EPA) said.
    The rise in the July/September quarter had originally been
put at 0.6 pct. The annualized growth rate accelerated to 3.2
pct in October/December from 3.0 pct in July/September.
    In the 1986 calendar year, GNP rose 2.5 pct, after a 4.7
pct increase in 1985. Last year's performance was the worst
since 1974, when GNP fell 1.4 pct. Agency officials blamed the
strong yen for depressing exports and manufacturing industry.
    In nominal terms, GNP rose 0.5 pct in the October/December
quarter, reflecting stable prices, after a one pct increase in
the previous three months, the Agency said.
    Domestic real demand increased 0.6 pct in October/December,
after a one pct rise the previous quarter.
    Domestic demand contributed 0.5 percentage point to real
GNP growth in October/December, while foreign trade added 0.2.
The figures do not tally exactly due to rounding.
    In July/September, domestic demand contributed one
percentage point to GNP growth while foreign trade knocked off
0.3 point.
    Of the 0.2 point contribution of foreign trade to GNP last
quarter, falling exports knocked off 0.2 while falling imports
contributed 0.4 point.
    Total export volume fell 1.2 pct quarter on quarter in
October/December. Imports also fell, by 2.9 pct.
    Of the 0.5 point contribution of domestic demand to
October/December GNP growth, the private sector accounted for
0.4 point and the public sector, 0.2.
    The private sector contribution included 0.3 point for
housebuilding, 0.4 for corporate capital outlays and 0.1 for
stockbuilding. Consumer spending had a 0.4 negative impact.

The Agriculture Ministry is expected to
reduce official intervention prices for beef and pork in
1987/88 starting in April, but the cutback ratio has not been
set yet, industry sources said.
    Production prices, the basis for setting intervention
prices, have been falling because of declining compound feed
prices due to low coarse grain import prices, they said.
    Last November an advisory panel urged the government to
work on reducing officially set high farm product prices to
levels closer to international values, the sources added.
    In Japan the government maintains a price stabilisation
zone system for beef and pork to support domestic producers.
    The stabilisation zone is kept by the semi-government
Livestock Industry Promotion Corp (LIPC) through a buffer stock
operation in the wholesale market.
    The 1987/88 beef and pork price stabilisation zone will be
set by the end of March after an advisory panel to the
Agriculture Ministry recommends the price zone at a meeting on
March 25, ministry officials said. At present, the standard or
bottom price of castrated wagyu beef, known as marbled beef, is
1,400 yen per kilo, while its ceiling is 1,820, they said.
    The standard price of other beef, mainly produced from
dairy steers, is now 1,090 yen per kilo and the ceiling is
1,420, the officials said. The pork standard price is now 540
yen per kilo and the ceiling 760.
    They said the domestic beef intervention price influences
imported beef selling prices on the domestic market.
    Japan sets an annual beef import quota. A semi-government
body imports most of this and releases it to wholesalers or
processors in line with the standard price of other beef
categories in an attempt to avoid jeoparadising domestic beef
prices, they said.

Britain's Public Sector Borrowing
Requirement (PSBR) showed a provisional net repayment of 300
mln stg in February, compared with an unrevised 3.7
billion stg repayment in January, the Treasury said.
    This gives a cumulative PSBR in the first 11 months of the
current fiscal year of 100 mln stg, compared with a 2.7 billion
requirement in the like period last year.
    The government's forecast for the PSBR in fiscal 1986/87 is
7.1 billion stg, but markets expect a significant undershoot on
this number. The February data was within market forecasts.
    The Central Government Borrowing Requirement on its own
account in February was a net repayment of 100 mln stg after a
unrevised net repayment of 3.4 billion stg in January. In the
first 11 months, the central government borrowing on its own
account was 2.3 billion stg, after 2.1 billion in January.
    Local Authorities made a repayment estimated at 100 mln stg
in February. The cumulative local authorities' repayment for
the first 11 months was 700 mln. The Treasury said the fall
about 2.5 billion stg in the cumulative PSBR at this point this
year over last was largely due to lower public corporation and
local authority borrowing. This was also the case last month,
it said.
    The Public Corporations' Borrowing Requirement is estimated
at minus 400 mln stg, to give a cumulative repayment of 1.4
billion stg.
    The local authority and public sector surplus on the 11
months cumulative basis was 2.1 billion, compared with a flat
position at the same stage last year.
    The Treasury said that the proceeds from privatisation of
<British Airways Plc> reduced requirements by 400 mln stg.
    The Treasury said the General Government Borrowing
Requirement is estimated to be a net repayment of 100 mln stg
in February, giving a cumulative requirement of 1.1 billion.
    Consolidated fund revenue was 8.8 billion stg in February,
giving a cumulative total of 101.4 billion in the first 11
months, 4.5 pct up from the like stage last year.
    Inland Revenue Receipts for the first 11 months were 1.8
billion stg, or 3.5 pct higher than a year earlier. Receipts
from Customs and Excise were 3.5 billion stg in the first 11
months, 10.5 pct higher than in the previous year.
    The Treasury said that budget forestalling, when traders
bring in goods in advance of today's annual budget, brought in
300 mln stg more in customs and excise receipts than in
February 1986.
    Consolidated fund expenditure was 8.4 billion stg in
February, with a cumulative 102.5 billion for the first 11
months, four pct higher than in the previous year.
    Supply expenditure was provisionally estimated at 8.3

The Japanese economy will remain sluggish
in the months ahead after turning in its worst performance for
12 years in 1986, private economists said.
    Consumer spending, a main driving force of domestic demand,
was likely to remain lacklustre although brisk housing and
business investment would help sustain the economy this year,
the economists said.
    They said they were shocked by an Economic Planning Agency
report today that private spending fell 0.7 pct in the Oct/Dec
quarter for the first time in 12 years.
    The report said Japan's gross national product rose a real
0.8 pct in Oct/Dec after a revised 0.7 pct increase in the
previous quarter.
    It said GNP growth for 1986 was a real 2.5 pct, down from
4.7 pct in 1985. Agency officials said this was the worst
performance since 1974 when GNP contracted 1.4 pct in the wake
of the first oil crisis.
    They expressed concern about the 0.7 pct decline in
consumer spending in the final quarter of 1986 but said it was
only temporary as exceptionally warm winter weather had
depressed retail sales.
    But most private economists disagreed and said consumers
were likely to remain pessimistic in coming months as they saw
their real income level off.
    "Sure, consumers may have spent less on winter clothes or
heating apparatus because of the warm winter this year, but
they have done so because they have become even more uneasy
about their future pay rises," said Shoji Saito, general manager
of Mitsui Bank's economic research division.
    He said the outlook for pay increases was gloomy because of
 falling employment in many industries, particularly those hit
hard by the yen's rise.
    Masao Suzaki, senior economist at the Bank of Tokyo, said
weakened consumer confidence was the most worrying factor.
Without brisk consumer spending, Japan can hardly achieve
domestically generated economic growth as the government has
put a lid on fiscal measures, he said.
    Other economists said the 0.8 pct growth registered in
Oct/Dec may have been inflated by special factors, including
exceptionally heavy spending in the public sector. Johsen
Takahashi, chief economist at Mitsubishi Research Institute,
said the 14.4 pct increase in public sector spending in Oct/Dec
resulted from an issue of gold coins.
    "This is just a one-shot spending and we can't expect that
high level of public-sector consumption in the following
quarter," Takahashi said. Agency officials said public spending
would have risen 1.1 pct in Oct/Dec without the issue, which
marked 60 years of Emperor Hirohito's reign.
    Takahashi said the economy might contract in the current
quarter given the lack of additional significant government
spending and sluggish consumer spending.
    Saito said the most effective government action would be
income tax cuts and the postponement beyond next January of a
proposed controversial sales tax.

Data on the U.K.'s public sector
borrowing requirement has boosted hopes of a large fiscal
adjustment for the coming financial year, broking and banking
analysts said.
    Some analysts say that the Chancellor of the Exchequer
Nigel Lawson may announce this afternoon a total of up to six
billion stg in tax cuts and lower government borrowing targets.
    Total PSBR in the first 11 months of the fiscal year of 100
mln stg compares with a projected seven billion. Forecasts had
generally been for a net repayment in February, but the 300 mln
stg repayment was toward the better end of expectations.
    March is usually a high-spending month, boosting the 11
month figure at the end of the fiscal year. Nevertheless,
Lawson is expected to downwardly revise the 1986/87 PSBR later
today.
    Until now, only the more optimistic forecasts put Lawson's
room for manoeuvre as great as six billion stg for 1987/88,
with many favouring a four billion of five billion package.
    But Bill Martin, economist at brokers Phillips and Drew,
said a six billion stg adjustment now looks within range, split
between three billion off the PSBR and three billion off taxes.
    Malcolm Roberts, of Salomon Bros International, also said
six billion was within a credible range of forecasts.
    Roberts added that he was now expecting Lawson to have at
least five billion stg available following this morning's data,
against his own previous estimates of around four billion.
    He said today's 11 month PSBR figure was genuinely low,
rather than distorted by unusual factors, which fuels pressure
on Lawson to reduce next year's borrowing target. However, he
forecast a March 1987 PSBR of 3.5 billion stg.
    Peter Fellner, of brokers James Capel, cautioned that six
billion still looks on the high side of expectations.
    "Something like 4.5 (billion) or so is still more realistic,"
he said.

Copper shares, which have lagged
behind the market, should pick up steam this year on stronger
demand and improving prices for the metal, analysts said.
    "Copper prices should move up over the next four to six
quarters," said Daniel Roling of Merrill Lynch and Co <MER>. "I
see average copper prices at 70 cts a pound in 1988, up from
around 63 or 64 cts, based on tight supply and continued world
economic growth."
    Other analysts see metal prices ranging from 65 to 68 cts a
pound this year and 70 to 73 cts in 1988.
    Analysts said Phelps Dodge Corp <PD> will be a strong
performer because it is the largest U.S. copper producer.
    But Asarco Inc <AR>, with about 45 pct of total sales from
copper, and Newmont Mining Corp <NEM> are also potential
winners, they said. Newmont is spinning off 85 pct of its
copper operations to its shareholders.
    "In theory, Phelps is the best stock. It's the purest play
and benefits most from higher copper prices," one said.
    William Siedenburg of Smith Barney Harris Upham and Co,
said Phelps has lowered costs and streamlined mining
operations. "They've accomplished a great deal," he said.
    The company's move into carbon black, a product used in
tires, should provide steady earnings, although not rapid
growth, as a hedge against a copper downturn, Siedenburg said.
He estimates Phelps will earn 2.45 dlrs in 1987 and 4.45 dlrs
in 1988, including tax benefits, versus 1.79 dlrs in 1986.
    Other analysts, including Clarence Morrison of Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc and Merrill's Roling, also recommend Phelps.
    Morrison projects Phelps will earn 3.25 dlrs in 1987 and
four dlrs in 1988, while Roling sees earnings at 2.75 dlrs this
year and around 3.50 dlrs next year.
    "The stock can go to the mid 30s," Roling said, from its
current level of around 30. But others see it climbing to 40.
    "Their (Phelps Dodge) costs are so low, they don't need
copper prices higher than 70 cts to make a lot of money," said
Vahid Fathi of Prescott Ball and Turben Inc. "The shares will
outperform the market over the next 18 months," he said.
    But Nick Toufexis of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc says
Newmont Mining is a more attractive investment. "We'd rather
place our bets with Newmont. Any way you slice it, I see a
significant premium to the current stock price," he said.
    After the spinoff, which closes next month, Newmont will
have gold operations, including 95 pct of Newmont Gold Co
<NGC>, a 15 pct stake in its copper unit and energy operations,
Toufexis noted.
    Analysts see Newmont earning 2.85 dlrs to three dlrs in
1987 and about 3.75 dlrs in 1988, versus earnings of about 1.40
dlrs from operations in 1986.
    "I'd be buying up to 90," Toufexis said last week, when the
stock rose sharply to near that level. "But the shares are
probably worth about 108 dlrs (each)."
    Dean Witter's Morrison and Fathi of Prescott Ball like
Asarco, because of cost cutting and restructuring. Morrison
sees 1987 earnings at 1.25 dlrs and 1988 at 1.75 against losses
in 1986. Fathi projects Asarco will earn one dlr in 1987 and
from three dlrs to 3.25 dlrs in 1988.
    Roling of Merrill Lynch is recommending Cyprus Minerals Co
<CYPM> in addition to Phelps Dodge. Cyprus has interests in
coal and other minerals aside from copper.
    But Siedenburg of Smith Barney thinks Cyprus is overpriced
at current levels. "I would be willing to sell Cyprus and buy
Phelps Dodge if I were picking one copper stock," he said.

U.S. banks are under pressure to
meet vigorous competition, but Congress continues to duck hard
choices on banking law reform that could benefit consumers.
    Supporters say deregulating banking will increase
competition, offer consumers more choices and bring lower fees
for financial services and home mortgage interest rates.
    But the Senate Banking Committee last week put off until
later in the year decisions on pressing issues such as whether
banks could enter new businesses like underwriting corporate
debt and selling insurance and real estate.
    The committee also reined in banks' competitors, the
so-called nonbank banks, which elude the technical definition
of a bank because they do not both accept deposits and make
loans. The committee meeting room became a battleground for
giants of the financial industry -- banks, brokerages,
insurance firms, retail and industrial corporations -- with but
little consideration given to the consumer.
    The lobbies backed various amendments to protect their turf
and a bill that rescues a federal deposit insurance fund for
thrift institutions and puts a moratorium on any changes in
banking law was passed and sent on to the full Senate.
    The House of Representatives has yet to act.
    Behind the political deals was the larger question whether
Congress would end or modify the half-century-old separation of
commercial and investment banking or leave it alone.
    One argument in support of change is that fees for
financial services would come down if Congress expands banks'
powers.
    Lower fees to underwrite mortgage-backed securities, for
example, could lead to lower interest rates on home mortgages,
supporters say.
    "A lot of nonbanking firms have used loopholes to get into
banking, but banks have not be allowed into any new businesses,"
says Robert Litan of the Brookings Institution.
    "We have been seeing a gigantic turf war," says Litan, who
favors new powers for banks if deposits are safeguarded.
    The swirl of corporate mergers and the financial
information explosion have blurred the distinction between the
activities of banks and security brokerages.
    On a wider horizon, U.S. financial institutions face
stepped-up competition from financial centers like London and
Tokyo in international transactions.
    West German and Japanese banking is more concentrated in a
few, large banks, while most European countries allow banking
and securities to be mixed.
    All these forces put pressure on U.S. financial firms to
adapt to change, but the congressional debate over reform drags
on. The committee's bill put a freeze on any changes and its
chairman, Senator William Proxmire, promised to return the
issues in October. If approved by Congress, the bill would
postpone applications before the Federal Reserve for new powers
to three of the largest banks -- Citicorp, J.P. Morgan and
Bankers Trust.
    Other industries where regulatory barriers have fallen have
experienced lower fees, the emergence of new players and
accelerated innovation.
    But these advances in airlines, trucking, and
telecommunications have not been without drawbacks. Companies
that were slow to adapt disappeared under the new competitive
regime, while the public faced a bewildering number of new
choices. The Reagan administration favors bank reform.
    The traditional method companies use to raise funds --
borrowing from banks -- has given way to selling corporate debt
and other new securities that are off limits to banks.
    But critics say the soundness of the banking system created
by such laws as the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act would be
undermined.
    Banks are treated as special and shielded from the
marketplace's vagaries by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp (FSLIC) performs
the same function for thrifts.
    The one issue the committee did act on which benefits
consumers is new funding for the federal insurance fund for
deposits at savings and loan associations, which has fallen to
its lowest ratio of reserves to deposits in history.
    Despite efforts toward change in Congress, a ban on
interstate banking remains.
    The barriers are crumbling anyway because state
legislatures are agreeing to permit bank mergers across state
lines within a region.
    Congress is proceeding cautiously, having in mind the
banking industry's tribulations in the early 1930's.
    But some say it is moving too cautiously for banks to keep
pace with what is happening in business here and around the
world.

Livestock analysts expect renewed bull
spreading in live cattle futures following yesterday's USDA
7-state cattle on feed report.
    The USDA reported high placements in February, which may
weigh on back months of cattle futures. Meanwhile, continued
strong marketings during the month will support the April
contract.
    Contracts for June delivery forward could open 25 to 50
cents lower while April will likely open about steady, analysts
said.
    Cheap corn is still the main incentive for putting cattle
on feed, according to Smith Barney livestock analyst Tom
O'Hare. "They have no place to send the grain," he said.
    Strong daily fundamentals may add to nearby support while
the current discount of deferred months to the cash market may
offset much of the effect of the report, analysts said.
    "The cash market is strong and may overshadow the report,"
said Robin Fuller, analyst for Agri Analysis. She added that
even though placements came in above the average trade guess,
many traders had expected high placements.
    Placements are not that negative, especially since the
technical correction in June and August live cattle futures
since last week, GH Miller analyst Jerry Gidel said.
    He said the current marketing posture will provide added
support to the nearby month. Feedlot marketings have been
running at a heavier than expected pace.
    Chuck Levitt, analyst for Shearson Lehman said that with
the number of cattle on feed down five pct at the beginning of
the year, a three pct decline in marketings was expected. But
the report for January showed marketings at 101 pct of a year
ago and in February marketings were at 100 pct, Levitt noted.
    "So far we haven't seen any decline in marketings. They
(feedlot operators) are marketing more cattle than they had
intended for the first quarter, which is a bullish
development," Levitt said.
    Gidel also noted that marketings for the early part of
March are running ahead of a year ago. Feedlots are not falling
behind and are holding that 100 pct marketing pace.

There will be no significant changes
in U.S. agricultural policy this year, said Senate Minority
leader Robert Dole (R-Kan).
    Speaking at the annual convention of National Grain and
Feed Association, Dole said that while the current farm bill is
not perfect, "I still believe it is a step in the right
direction."
    Dole said he would like to reduce the costs of the program
but that expenditures will continue to be high until the U.S.
becomes more aggressive in its export policy through either the
broader use of the Export Enhancement Program or the
implementation of a market loan for wheat and feed grains.
    Commenting on whether the U.S. should offer the Soviet
Union subsidized grain, Dole said, "If your going to trade with
the Soviet Union you have to be competitive."
    He said one way to get around the problem of making direct
subsidies to the Soviets would be to implement a market loan,
which he said would make U.S. commodity prices competitive.
    Prospects for passage of mandatory production controls,
specifically the Harkin-Gephardt mandatory bill, are not good,
he said. "Mandatory has less support now than it did a year ago
and it will have even less support when people understand it,"
he said.
    If the House passes a pending 0/92 bill for 1987 winter
wheat, the Senate will try to address 0/92 for a one year
period, Dole added.

The U.S. current account deficit
widened to a record 36.84 billion dlrs on a balance of payments
basis in the October-December fourth quarter of 1986 from a
revised 35.29 billion dlrs in the third quarter, the Commerce
Department said.
    Previously, the department said the third-quarter deficit
was 36.28 billion dlrs.
    For the full year 1986, the current account, a broad
measure of trade performance, was in deficit a record 140.57
billion dlrs after a 117.68 billion dlr deficit in 1985.
    The department said an increase in the merchandise trade
deficit during the fourth quarter to 38.4 billion dlrs from
37.1 billion dlrs in the third quarter was the main reason for
the worsening deficit.
    Net service receipts declined to 5.5 billion dlrs in the
final quarter from six billion dlrs in the third quarter.
    The current account includes trade in merchandise and
services as well as U.S. financial transactions with the rest
of the world.
    The department said the merchandise trade deficit for all
of 1986 grew to 147.7 billion from 124.4 billion dlrs in 1985.
    Net service receipts were 22.3 billion dlrs in 1986,
compared with 21.7 billion dlrs in 1985, the department said.
    Net unilateral transfers during the fourth quarter last
year, covering foreign aid and government pensions, were down
to 3.9 billion dlrs from 4.2 billion dlrs in the third quarter
because of fewer U.S. government grants to Mideast countries.
    Liabilities to foreigners reported by U.S. banks rose 35.3
billion dlrs between October and December after increasing 30.1
billion dlrs in the third quarter.
    For the full year, these liabilities grew 77.4 billion dlrs
after rising by 40.4 billion dlrs in 1985.
    The department said inflows were boosted in the fourth
quarter by international activities of Japanese banks and
strong demand within the United States to finance acquisitions.
    Net foreign sales of U.S. Treasury securities by foreigners
were 2.7 billion dlrs in the quarter after purchases of 500 mln
dlrs in the third quarter.
    Net foreign purchases of securities other than U.S.
Treasury securities in the fourth quarter were 11.8 billion
dlrs, compared with 17.2 billion dlrs in the third quarter.
    For all 1986, foreign purchases of securities excluding
U.S. Treasury securities were a record 70.7 billion dlrs,
surpassing the previous record 50.9 billion dlr total in 1985.
   Claims on foreigners reported by U.S. banks in the fourth
quarter rose 29.9 billion dlrs after a 19.3 billion dlr
third-quarter increase.
    U.S. sales of foreign securities rose to 2.7 billion dlrs
from 300 mln dlrs in the third quarter because of a sharp
selloff of foreign stocks and bonds, the department said.
    Outflows for U.S. direct investment abroad fell to 5.7
billion dlrs from eight billion dlrs in the third quarter.
    Foreign direct investment in the United States increased
14.4 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter, compared with 5.6
billion dlrs in the previous quarter, because of stepped-up
acquisitions, the department said.
    Foreign official assets in the United States increased 800
mln dlrs between October and December after rising 15.4 billion
dlrs in the third quarter.
    For the full year 1986, foreign official assets grew 33.4
billion dlrs after a 1985 decrease of 1.9 billion dlrs as
foreign monetary authorities intervened heavily in exchange
markets late in the year as the dollar fell, commerce said.

Treasury Secretary James Baker urged
Congress to support the administration's financing requests for
the multilateral development banks in the next two fiscal
years.
    Baker told a House appropriations subcommittee the
administration's request for a total 2.1 billion dlrs in fiscal
1987 and 1988 would meet administration shortfalls and fulfill
Washington's annual payment responsibilities.
    In testimony that went over much of the same ground as his
remarks to a Senate committee some two weeks ago, Baker said
support for the MDBs was crucial to U.S. economic leadership.
    Baker told the committee, "Our national self respect and
our international leadership depend on our willingness to
fulfill this responsibility."
    The administration budget requests include a supplemental
request for fiscal 1987 of 293 mln dlrs and a 1.8 billion dlr
request for fiscal 1988.
    Baker noted these requests included funding requirements
negotiated by the administration with this committee.
    Baker's remarks outlined why the development banks were
formed and the stake the U.S. had in maintaining them.
    Baker pointed out the U.S. has successfully sought reforms
in several of the institutions and was pressing for reforms in
others aimed at making them more efficient, with policies
oriented toward free markets.
    He also gave the House subcommittee a progress report on
the debt strategy and emphasized the importance of continued
financing for the MDBs if the U.S. is to continue to lead in
resolving the debt crisis.
    In other remarks, Baker repeated the need to finance the
general foreign affairs budget and underscored how MDBs have
served U.S. national interests.

The National Association of
Securities Dealers Inc said its board of governors has proposed
adoption of uniform rules by major U.S. stock markets which
would emphasize equal shareholder voting rights but allow for
legitimate variations.
    The NASD said its proposal would eliminate differences in
stockholder voting standards as a competitive factor between
markets. It called on the Securities and Exchange Commission to
adopt such a rule applying to all markets if each equity market
is unwilling to voluntarily adopt a uniform rule under the
commission's guidence.
    "Clearly the NASD would willingly be the first to"
voluntarily adopt a uniform rule such as it is proposing, NASD
President Gordon S. Macklin said in a letter to SEC Chairman
John S.R. Shad.
    The NASD said its view is based on the association's study
of the issue and from information developed at the SEC's
recently concluded hearings on the subject.
    The current discussion of the one share-one vote issue was
triggered by the New York Stock Exchange's application to the
SEC for permission to abandon the standard with respect to
companies listed on the NYSE, the NASD noted.
    It called for limiting variations of equal voting rights to
situations involving complete disclosure such as - 
    (1) shares in a registerd public offering where all facts
connected with the company's capital structure are clearly
spelled out in the prospectus and - 
    (2) shares issued in connection with a merger, acquisition
or recapitalization where the exchange of shares is accompanied
by detailed proxy material.
    The NASD said the uniform rule should be written to
disallow the issuance of dual classes of shares where those
with superior voting rights are not resalable.

The western industrialised nations have
agreed reforms in rules by which they provide credit for
exports to developing countries, the Organisation for Economic
Cooperation and Development said.
    The reforms tighten the rules for the use of foreign aid to
subsidise export credits in so-called "mixed credits," the OECD
said.
    The agreement, to be implemented in two stages in July this
year and July 1988, means the minimum aid component in mixed
credits will be raised to 35 pct from 25 pct, and to 50 pct for
credits covering exports to the world's least developed
nations.
    Additionally, a new formula will be used for calculating
the aid element in mixed credits, to take account of different
interest rates in the exporting countries, the 24-nation OECD,
which hosted the reform negotiations, said.
    Minimum interest rates for officially subsidised trade
loans have also been revised with the aim of cutting the
subsidies, and ending them completely on loans to relatively
rich developing countries by July next year.
    The reforms follow several years of pressure by the U.S. To
stop competitors, notably France and Japan, using foreign aid
to subsidise exports, putting U.S. Firms at a disadvantage.
    OECD officials said the agreement was based on a
provisional accord reached in January subject to ratification
by member governments. Some governments, including Austria, had
linked their final approval to other trade credit issues which
would be discussed at a meeting here in mid-April, they added.
    By raising the minimum amount of aid required in mixed
credits the agreement aims to make such hidden subsidies too
costly for frequent use.
    "A major loophole in the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade has been closed today," a senior U.S. Official here
commented.

Treasury Secretary James Baker,
while defending the progress of his 1985 debt initiative,
conceded that lending by commercial banks to developing
countries has not gone as fast as the administration would have
liked.
    In testimony before a House Appropriations subcommittee,
Baker said, however, "I think it is wrong to say that
(commercial bank lending) has not occured in a meaningful way."
    He added though that it has not "materialized as fast as we
would have liked."
    The Treasury secretary also said that it would be
politically wrong for the United States or other countries to
guarantee loans made by commercial banks to the developing
country debtors because that would be "rightly perceived as a
bank bailout."
    Baker also said that it would be impractical for
governments to mandate bank lending to the third world since
this would have the eventual impact of turning commercial banks
away from making all loans to the region.

Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
Lawson, presenting his budget for fiscal 1987/88 to Parliament,
said U.K. Economic growth was forecast at three pct in calendar
1987.
    He said the Treasury expected a current account balance of
payments deficit in 1987 of 2.5 billion stg, after a 1.1
billion shortfall in 1986.
    Inflation is expected to be 4.0 pct at the end of this
year, Lawson said.
    "As I forecast in the Autumn Statement, inflation may
continue to edge up for a time, perhaps exceeding 4.5 pct by
the summer, before falling back to 4.0 pct by the end of the
year," he added.
    Turning to the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR),
Lawson said the likely outturn for fiscal 1986/87 was 4.0
billion stg, or 1.0 pct of GDP.
    The planned PSBR for 1987/88 was set at 4.0 billion stg.
    On monetary policy, Lawson confirmed the target range for
the narrow M0 measure would be two to six pct in fiscal
1987/88.
    No explicit target was set for the broad sterling M3
aggregate, he said. "But broad money will continue to be taken
into account in assessing monetary conditions, as of course
will the exchange rate," the Chancellor told Parliament.
    Lawson said the low outturn of the PSBR in 1986/87 "is
chiefly attributable to the remarkable buoyancy of non-oil tax
revenues in general, and the corporation tax paid by an
increasingly profitable business sector in particular."
    On oil prices, Lawson said he was sticking to his earlier
assumption that North Sea crude prices will average 15 dlrs per
barrel in calendar 1987.
    He said "it is clear that the increased flow of non-oil tax
revenues, coupled with the prospective further growth of the
economy in excess of the growth of public expenditure, puts the
public finances in a very strong position."
    Lawson said the Treasury would strive to keep the PSBR at
1.0 pct of GDP in future.
    "We have reached what I judge to be the (Medium Term
Financial Strategy's) appropriate destination - a PSBR of 1.0
pct of GDP. My aim will be to keep it there over the years
ahead," Lawson said.
    "Inevitably, this greatly diminishes the scope I have this
year for reducing the burden of taxation, which of course
remains a major objective of government policy."
    "But I am sure it is right to err on the side of prudence
and caution, and to build a still firmer base for the future."
    Lawson said the time had come to strike the Exchange
Control Act from the Statute book.
    On corporation tax, he said the rate will remain unchanged
at 35 pct in 1987/88. But companies' capital gains will be
charged at the "appropriate corporation tax rate."
    He said that under the new proposed system, companies
should be able to set Advanced Capital Tax (ACT) payments
against tax on capital gains.
    "Taken together, these changes should yield 60 mln stg in
1988/89," Lawson said.
    Lawson said he will propose that all companies and building
societies be treated the same way on payment of corporation
tax, "with all liable to pay corporation tax nine months after
the end of the accounting period on which the tax is due."
    "I also propose to legislate now to pave the way for a new
method of collecting corporation tax, to be known as Pay and
File."
    This would be part of a wider programme of streamlining tax
collection, and would not come into force until the early
1990s.
    Lawson said he planned two reliefs on Petroleum Revenue Tax
(PRT). As from today, companies may elect to have up to 10 pct
of the costs of developing certain new fields set against their
(PRT) liabilities in existing fields, until the income of those
new fields exceeds the costs incurred.
    Second, there will be a new relief against PRT for spending
on research into U.K. Oil extraction that is not related to any
particular field.
    On business employment, Lawson said employers will receive
tax relief for retraining workers.
    Lawson said that in future, traders registered for Value
Added Tax (VAT) would be able to choose to account for the tax
on the basis of cash paid and received.
    Small businesses may account for VAT annually instead of
quarterly. The VAT compulsory registration period was being
extended to 30 days, he added, and VAT registration thresholds
are to be raised to 21,300 stg.
    New measures are planned to combat VAT avoidance, he added.
    The capital gains tax retirement relief limit would now be
set at 125,000 stg.
    Lawson said he proposed to change the law so that companies
in multinational groups with dual residence will no longer be
able to secure tax relief twice on the same interest payment.
The change will take effect on April 1, 1987, but "genuine
trading companies" will not be affected.
    He also planned to end the present treatment of tax credit
relief for foreign withholding tax paid on interest on bank
loans, also from April 1.
    "In future, banks will be able to offset this tax credit
only against tax on the profit on the relevant loan," he said.
    The standard rate of taxation is being reduced by two
pence, to 27 pct from 29 pct.
    Lawson reiterated the government's aim of reducing basic
taxation to 25 pence in the pound, but added "given my decision
to use the greater part of the fiscal scope I now have to
reduce the PSBR, that goal cannot be achieved in this budget."
    Small companies' corporation tax is also being reduced to
27 pct, he said.
    On the Lloyd's insurance market, Lawson said he planned to
change the tax treatment of Lloyd's syndicates, bringing it
into line with that of provisions for outstanding liabilities
made by ordinary insurance companies and of comparable
provisions made by financial traders.
    The Inland Revenue would be told to consult urgently with
Lloyd's about the details of the legislation, he said.
    "The new rules will first apply to premiums payable for the
Lloyd's account which closes on December 31 this year," Lawson
said.

Lehman Brothers said he recommended a number of oil stocks
today now that it is apparent that OPEC has succeeded in

    "It is clear that OPEC, through jawboning and quota
restraint, will boost the price of oil," Margoshes said.
    Prices of oil stocks rose sharply today in response to
higher oil prices and optimism about OPEC quotas. Margoshes
said he recommends Imperial Oil <IMO.A>, up 1/2 to 49-1/8,
Standard Oil Co <SRD>, 7/8 to 62-3/4, Exxon <XON> one to

barrel level again, but the main thrust of investing in oil is
positive right now. Before the year is out we will see higher
oil prices."

Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
Lawson, presenting his budget for fiscal 1987/88 to parliament,
said U.K. Economic growth was forecast at three pct in calendar
1987.
    He said the Treasury expected a current account balance of
payments deficit in 1987 of 2.5 billion stg, after a 1.1
billion shortfall in 1986. Inflation is expected to be 4.0 pct
at the end of 1987, he said, adding it may exceed 4.5 pct by
the summer before falling back to 4.0 pct by the end of the
year.
    The planned PSBR for 1987/88 was 4.0 billion stg unchanged
when compared with the likely outturn for fiscal 1986/87,
Lawson said.
    Although no explicit target was set for the broad sterling
M3 money supply, Lawson said broad money will continue to be
taken into account in assessing monetary conditions as well as
the exchange rate.
    The low outturn of the PSBR in 1986/87 was mainly due to
the buoyancy of non-oil tax revenues in general, and the
corporation tax paid by an increasingly profitable business
sector in particular.
    On oil prices, Lawson said he was sticking to his earlier
assumption that North Sea crude prices will average 15 dlrs per
barrel in calendar 1987. The treasury would strive to keep the
PSBR at 1.0 pct of GDP in future, he said.

West German feedstuffs production is
expected to decline further after it dropped to 16.5 mln tonnes
in 1986 from 16.7 mln the previous year, the West German Feed
Stuff Industry Association (MFI) said.
    Association president Ulrich Wagner told a news conference
West Germany's rate of self sufficiency in the feedstuffs
sector is expected to fall below 70 pct this year from around
75 pct in 1986.
    He attributed the expected decline to introduction of milk
quotas in 1984, aimed at curbing EC milk production, and to
cheaper imports from abroad.
    "Our industry's output is not even close to stagnation,"
Wagner said. "In the long term we expect annual production to
decline steadily."
    The only sector which saw a slight increase last year, by
0.6 pct, was feed for poultry which rose to 3.25 mln tonnes
from 3.23 mln, he said.
    Wagner predicted that the sales volume in feed for dairy
cattle will decline even more this year because of the further
cut in milk output from April.

A proposal by two U.S. House
Democrats to target government farm benefits to small- and
medium-sized farms was warmly received by Democrats on a
House subcommittee today.
    "On balance, this is the best new idea I have seen," said
Rep. Dan Glickman (D-Kan.), Chairman of the House Agriculture
Subcommittee on Wheat, Feedgrains and Soybeans. "This is the
first hard constructive proposal coming out as an alternative
to the (Reagan) administration's farm proposal."
    The plan, offered by Reps. Tim Penny (D-Minn.) and Byron
Dorgan (D-ND), would raise target prices for wheat to 5.00 dlrs
per bushel and for corn to 3.50 dlrs. Producers could receive
deficiency payments on up to 80 pct of normal yield but not
more than on 30,000 bu of corn and 20,000 bu of wheat.
    The proposal also would require acreage reductions of 20
pct, eliminate generic certificates and prohibit persons not
actively engaged in farming from receiving program benefits.
    Dorgan said the bill would save 24 billion dlrs over five
years, protect family farms and eliminate government
accumulation of stocks because nonrecourse loans would be
halted.
    However, Rep. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) said the measure would
"involve the federal government in deciding and defining who a
family farmer is."
    Roberts said the bill, for example, would restrict program
payments to 500 acres of wheat production in western Kansas.
    Other Republicans on the panel questioned how the bill
would determine if a person was actively engaged in farming and
therefore eligible for payments.

Two new U.K. Tax relief measures for oil
producers, announced today, are aimed at encouraging
developments in the North Sea to go ahead and boost
opportunities for the offshore supplies industry, the Inland
Revenue said in a post-budget statement.
    Earlier, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson announced
in his annual budget to Parliament that from today, companies
will be allowed to offset up to 10 pct of qualifying
development expenditure on certain future oil fields against
Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT).
    To date, full relief was allowed for expenditure on an
individual field itself, when its income stream began, but was
not immediately available against other development
expenditure, the statement said.
    The new relief will apply to fields outside the southern
basin for which development
consent is first given on or after today, and will improve the
post-tax economics of new developments and encourage companies
to proceed with project which might have been delayed, it said.
    Lawson also announced that he would henceforth allow
certain expenditure on oil related research which does not at
present qualify for PRT relief to be offset against PRT
liability.
    This means oil-related expenditure in the U.K. Or on the
U.K. Continental shelf, which has not become allowable in a
particular field within three years of being incurred, to be
allowed against PRT liability in any oil field, the Inland
Revenue said.
    This brings the scope of PRT relief for research costs more
in line with corporation tax relief measures, and is planned to
encourage general research into ways of reducing field
development costs, it said.
    In due course, the industry should benefit by over 100 mln
stg a year, it calculated.
    The Inland Revenue statement also included other technical
measures that Lawson did not comment on in his budget speech.
    These included measures to allow companies to balance their
shares of PRT-exempt oil allowances through reallocation in two
past periods of allowance utilisation.
    Tidier rules on incorrectly allowed PRT expenditure reliefs
were announced, while there were also ammendments on rules on
corporation tax and Advance Corporation Tax relating to the
so-called "ring fence" of activities in the U.K. And its
continental shelf. The Finance Bill will have provisions for
the implementation of measures announced in November, it said.
    Gareth Lewis Davies, a North Sea expert with stockbrokers
Wood Mackenzie and Co Inc in Edinburgh, thought the two reliefs
on PRT would help the depressed offshore industry.
    He said the 10 pct cross field allowance relief would
favour chances that development of smaller North Sea fields
such Osprey, Don and Arbroath would be brought forward.
    Early development of the larger Miller and Bruce oil fields
might also be encouraged, he said.
    Lewis Davies said the measure might also aid the offshore
construction industry, which suffered a huge amount of lay-offs
under the price slump of more than 50 pct last year.
    He pointed out that the relief only applies to the
development of new fields outside the Southern Basin.
    This means more jobs could be created, as the fields in the
central and northern sectors of the North Sea are deeper than
in the south and thus have greater capital and labour
requirements as the waters are deeper than in the south.
    He said the PRT relief for certain research expenditure
would help fundamental research in the oil industry, although
the benefits of this research would not be seen for several
year.

Texas Eastern Corp's Texas Eastern
Gas Pipleline unit President Howard C. Homeyer said the company
is committed to cleaning up polychlorinated biphyenyls PCBs
from its pipeline system.
    In testimony before Sen. Frank Lautenberg's (D-N.J.),
oversight committee on Environment and Public Works, a press
statement said Homeyer said the company will work with the
Environmental Protection Agency to immediately clean up
contaminated sites.
    The New York Times today reported that the EPA knew as
early as the fall of 1985 about PCB contamination at sites
along the Texas Eastern pipeline, but took no action because
the company supplied insufficient information.
    According to the Times, Texas Eastern admitted burying PCBs
at 51 sites along its right of way.
    Homeyer told the committee, according to a statement, that
the cleanup will require cooperation among EPA headquarters,
six EPA regions and a dozen states to avoid delays.

American Telephone and Telegraph Co and
Philips Telecommunications BV (APT) would hold 36 pct through
direct and indirect holdings in France's <Cie Generale de
Constructions Telephoniques> if a joint bid with French
partners for the soon-to-be-privatised firm succeeds, a
director at one of the partner firms said.
    Marc Mathieu of <Societe Anonyme de Telecommunications>
SAT, told journalists the bid foresaw a direct stake of 20 pct
for APT, the joint firm set up by the U.S.'s ATT <T.N.> and the
NV Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken <PGLO.AS>.
    The other 80 pct would be owned by a holding company made
up of SAT, APT, Cie du Midi <MCDP.PA> and five mutual funds.
   Under French law, foreign investors are restricted to a 20
pct direct stake in privatised companies but can boost their
stake to 40 pct through indirect holdings.
    The make-up of the holding company, however, is subject to
close discussions within the government due to legal queries
over the nationality of the mutual funds, a Finance Ministry
official said.
    Although bought by French citizens they are managed by
foreign banks <Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of New York> and
<Banque de Neuflize, Schlumberger, Mallet SA>, controlled by
Algemene Bank Nederland NV <ABNN.AS>, an SAT spokesman said.
    CGCT, which controls 16 pct of the French public telephone
switching market, is to be sold by the government for 500 mln
francs by private tender.
    Five groups are bidding for the company and the government
has said it will choose CGCT's new owner by the end of April.
    APT vice-president Wim Huisman told a news conference a
capital increase was envisaged if SAT-APT wins CGCT, but
declined to give details or say how an increase would affect
foreign stakes in CGCT.
    In 1985, CGCT posted losses of 200 mln francs on sales of
three billion after 1984 losses of 997 mln francs.
    A joint SAT-APT statement added that buyers were committed
to investing 240 mln francs in CGCT research and production
plants. The APT-SAT offer includes a provision for CGCT to
produce APT 5ESS-PRX switching technology and adapt it to
French standards.
    The tender was launched after a 1985 draft agreement for
ATT to take over CGCT was abandoned following the introduction
of the French government privatisation laws which reopened
bidding among a wider range of applicants.
    Other candidacies to take over CGCT include West Germany's
Siemens AG <SIEG.F> allied with Schneider SA <SCHN.PA>
subsidiary Jeumont-Schneider, Sweden's Telefon AB LM Ericsson

British bank base lending rates are
likely to fall by as much as one full point to 9-1/2 pct this
week following the sharp three billion stg cut in the U.K.
Central government borrowing target to four billion stg set in
today's 1987 budget, bank analysts said.
    The analysts described Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
Lawson's budget as cautious, a quality which currency and money
markets had already started to reward.
    Sterling surged on foreign exchange markets and money
market interest rates moved sharply lower as news of the budget
measures came through, the analysts said.
    Lloyds merchant bank chief economist Roger Bootle said he
expected base rates to be cut by one full point tomorrow.
    "This is very much a safety-first budget in order to get
interest rates down," he said.
    Bootle said the money markets had almost entirely
discounted such a one point cut, with the key three month
interbank rate down to 9-11/16 pct from 9-13/16 last night, and
it would be rather conservative for banks to go for a
half-point cut now.
    Midland Bank treasury economist David Simmonds said he,
too, expected base rates would be a full point lower by Friday,
but this would likely happen via two half-point cuts.
    "This budget is designed to please both the markets and the
electorate. The implications for interest rates are very
favourable, we could have a half-point cut tomrorow and another
such cut before the end of the week," Simmonds said.
    Pointing to buoyant U.K. Retail data released yesterday, he
said Lawson had done well to resist pressures for a sharp cut
in income tax rates at the expense of a lower borrowing target.
"There is no real need to boost private consumption," he said.
    National Westminster Bank chief economist David Kern said
the lower borrowing target set in the budget had increased the
likelihood of an early one-point base rate cut.
    Kern said the budget would have to be analysed carefully,
in particular to see how exactly Lawson planned to achieve the
sharper than expected borrowing target cut, before a one-point
base rate cut could be implemented.
 But providing the budget small-print was convincing, "and I
suspect it will be, it is entirely possible that we see one
point off base rates by the end of this week," Kern said.
    Bootle of Lloyds said the expected base rate cut would pave
the way for an early one-point cut in mortgage lending rates.
This would help achieve Lawson's lower than expected consumer
price inflation target of four pct at end-1987, he said.
    U.K. Base rates were cut last week to 10-1/2 pct from 11
pct after sustained pressure from the foreign exchange, money
and government bonds (gilts) markets.
    But building societies said they would not cut lending
rates until base rates had fallen by one full point.

The western industrialised nations have
agreed reforms in rules by which they provide credit for
exports to developing countries, the Organisation for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) said.
    The reforms tighten the rules for the use of foreign aid to
subsidise export credits in so-called "mixed credits," the OECD
said.
    The agreement, to be implemented in two stages in July this
year and July 1988, means the minimum aid component in mixed
credits will be raised to 35 pct from 25 pct, and to 50 pct for
credits covering exports to the world's least developed
nations.
    Additionally, a new formula will be used for calculating
the aid element in mixed credits, to take account of different
interest rates in the exporting countries, the 24-nation OECD,
which hosted the reform negotiations, said.
    Minimum interest rates for officially subsidised trade
loans have also been revised with the aim of cutting the
subsidies, and ending them completely on loans to relatively
rich developing countries by July next year.
    The reforms follow several years of pressure by the U.S. To
stop competitors, notably France and Japan, using foreign aid
to subsidise exports, putting U.S. Firms at a disadvantage.
    OECD officials said the agreement was based on a
provisional accord reached in January subject to ratification
by member governments. Some governments, including Austria, had
linked their final approval to other trade credit issues which
would be discussed at a meeting here in mid-April, they added.
    By raising the minimum amount of aid required in mixed
credits the agreement aims to make such hidden subsidies too
costly for frequent use.
    "A major loophole in the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade has been closed today," a senior U.S. Official here
commented.

plasma is used by haemophilics to aid the clotting of blood.

Playboy Enterprises Inc said it has no
plans to restructure or to take the company private.
    Moreover, Chairman Hugh Hefner, who owns 71 pct of the more
than 9.4 mln shares outstanding, has no interest in selling his
stock, spokeswoman Robyn Radomski said. 
    Articles in two weekly business publications have said
Playboy is a takeover candidate because of what financial
analysts see as its undervalued asset base.
    Radomski said there were no corporate developments to
account for the recent unusual trading in Playboy's shares but
that there seemed to be a correlation with the two articles.
    Playboy shares are currently trading at 13-5/8 on turnover
of about 40,100 shares. For the past 52-weeks, the stock has
traded in a range of 5-7/8 to 13-1/4 on light volume.
    The reports, based on an asset evaluation by analyst Mark
Boyar, place Playboy's worth at about 280 mln dlrs, or 30 dlrs
a share. Boyar estimated Playboy's publishing to be worth about
130 mln dlrs, its product licensing, 50 mln dlrs, its real
estate, including a mansion in Beverly Hills at 30 mln dlrs and
its excess working capital after debt repayment of 70 mln dlrs,
according to Business Week.
    According to Boyar, the licensing division, Playboy mansion
and artwork alone make the firm worth about 20 dlrs a share,
the Forbes Magazine article said.
    According to Advertising Age, the Playboy logo is the most
recognized symbol after Coca Cola, another analyst noted.
    Radomski, noting that the articles were written without
contact with Playboy, said that "from time to time people do
speculate about the company."
    She said she had spoken with majority shareholder Hefner in
the "last day or so" for a reaction to the articles.
    American Securities analyst David Leibowitz believes
"anyone who bought in thinking takeover or lbo (leveraged
buyout) is likely to be disappointed because the chances are
nil." Management has repeatedly stated it will not take the
company private, he said.
    But "shareholders who held the stock prior to all the
publicity have gotten a heck of a ride for their money," he
said.
    Leibowitz said he also believes that the true asset value
of the company is likely to exceed the current price of the
stock. "But a leveraged buyout is not in the cards. I take
management at their word," he said.
    While Playboy's cable television operation is considered a
drain on the company by some analysts, Liebowitz sees
potential. "They do have a management plan for the cable
operation and the company as a whole," he said. "Were this plan
to, in fact, translate into reality, the opportunity for
earnings is significant," he said.

A White House-ordered report said 
that growing U.S. reliance on foreign oil into the year 2000
could have potentially damaging implications for national
security.
    The Energy Department study discusses several options to
curb reliance on foreign oil, but makes no recommendations.
    President Reagan and most Congressmen have previously ruled
out a tax on foreign oil as a way to curb imports and to help
the depressed domestic oil industry.
    Energy Secretary John Herrington said in a statement that
"although we have made gains in energy security in the last six
years, this report shows that there is justification for
national concern both over declining competitiveness of our
domestic oil and gas industry and over rising oil imports."
    The report said imports last year were 33 pct of U.S.
consumption and by the mid-1990s could rise to 50 pct.
    Among the report's options to ease U.S. reliance on foreign
oil are several already advocated by the Reagan Administration.
    President Reagan ordered the study last September, citing a
determination that the country never again become captive to a
foreign oil cartel, referring to the OPEC-led oil shortages and
sharp prices increases of the 1970s.
    The report said an import fee would raise prices and help
make it economical for U.S. oil firms to find and produce new
oil, as well as to cut imports, but on the whole the tax would
depress the nation's economy.

Coastal Corp said it expected earnings
for 1987 "to be significantly above" profits of 71.6 mln dlrs
last year.
    In a letter to shareholders appearing in the company's
newly-issued 1986 annual report, Coastal chairman Oscar Wyatt
did not elaborate on how much earnings were expected to
increase.
    The 1986 profits of Coastal, a natural gas production and
pipeline company, were halved from 1985 levels due to slumping
energy prices. The company's sales totaled 6.7 billion dlrs
last year.
    Coastal also said it sold its natural gas for an average
price of 2.17 dlrs per mcf in 1986, a drop of 18 pct from the
previous year. Oil and natural gas liquids sold for an average
14.20 dlrs a barrel in 1986, a reduction of 37 pct.
    The Houston-based company, which produced a daily average
of 120 mln cubic feet of gas and 11,149 barrels of oil, said it
had proved reserves at yearend 1986 of 28.6 mln barrels of oil
and 954 billion cubic feet of natural gas. Average reserve
replacement costs were 8.28 dlrs per barrel of oil equivalent
during the past three-year period, representing a little more

proposal for buffer stock rules this afternoon, delegates said.
    The plan, presented by ICCO Executive Director Kobena
Erbynn, represented a compromise between producer, European
Community, EC, and other consumer views on how the buffer stock
should operate, they said.
    The proposal involved three key principles. First, the
buffer stock manager would be open to offers for cocoa rather
than using fixed posted prices as previously, delegates said.
    Under an offer system, the buffer stock manager would be
free to choose cocoas of varying prices, they said.
    The second provision was that non-ICCO member cocoa could
comprise a maximum 10 pct of the buffer stock, while the third
laid out a pricing system under which the buffer stock manager
would pay differentials for different grades of cocoa, to be
set by a formula, the delegates said.
    After the plan was presented, working group delegates met
briefly in smaller groups of producers, EC consumers and all
consumers to look at the proposal. Producers gave no reaction
to the scheme and will respond to it when the working group
meets tomorrow at 1000 GMT, producer delegates said.
    Consumer members accepted the proposal as a good base to
work from, one consumer delegate said.
    Delegates said the proposal was only a starting point for
negotiations on buffer stock rules and subject to change.

Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
Lawson's budget contained virtually everything the government
bond (gilts) market had hoped for and is likely to help prices
race ahead in coming months, analysts and traders said.
    Indeed, in the first half hour after Lawson completed his
speech, gilt prices soared about 1-1/2 points, an extremely
sharp gain in such a short period of time. Overall, they rose
about two points on the day.
    "This budget was incredibly bullish for the gilts market,"
Morgan Grenfell and Co Ltd economist Stephen Bell said.
    Analysts said that in the light of the reaction to the
budget in the gilts and U.K. Money markets, U.K. Commercial
bank base rates are likely to be cut by as much as a full point
tomorrow.
    Analysts said the market's euphoria was simply a reflection
of supply and demand. The crucial piece of news in the budget
was that the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement would be held
to 4.0 billion stg.
    By comparison, a year ago, the PSBR was set at 7.0 billion
stg.
    The lower PSBR means the Bank of England will have to offer
far less new stock to the market to meet its funding needs and
the scarcity factor is sure to drive prices up further,
analysts said.
    "The PSBR at four billion is lower than anyone realistically
expected," Bell said. Most market expectations called for the
Chancellor to announce a PSBR of about 5.5 billion stg.
    S.G. Warburg Securities Co Ltd economist John Shepherd said
that overall, the Bank will have to sell about two billion less
in new securities next fiscal year -- a cut of about 15 pct in
total new issue volume.
    Chase Manhattan Securities Ltd international economist Andy
Wrobleski noted the Bank has already raised about 1.8 billion
stg of next year's funding needs this year via a series of tap
issues.
    The issues have been in a partly-paid form where the full
price does not have to be paid until the start of the new
fiscal year and therefore they are not counted in the current
year's fund raising.
    But the Bank of England will also be constrained from
issuing gilts in the conventional form by its promise to try
out a U.S.-style auction system in which firms bid for new
stock.
    The Bank will also have to offer at least one index-linked
issue where the rate paid to investors is tied to the Retail
Price Index, leaving about one to two billion stg, in total, to
be raised in the form of traditional stock.
    Analysts noted that the budget contains provision for a two
pence in the pound cut in the basic rate of income tax, in line
with most market expectations, although some operators had
expected a cut of up to four pence in the pound.
    The gilts market approved of the more modest tax cut,
Shepherd said, because "If it was more than two pct, they would
have become concerned about the economy heating up again."
    Also, a cut of two pence in the pound suggests that if the
ruling Conservative party is re-elected, another two pence cut
can be offered at budget time next year.
    Analysts said the gilts market may also be building steam
on the political implications of the budget which suggests an
early election.
    "All the goodies in this budget will be in place by the
middle of May," Morgan Grenfell's Bell said. "This makes a June
election very likely."
    Bell said some politically popular provisions omitted from
the budget, such as lifting the ceiling on the amount of
mortgage eligible for tax benefit and some provisions on
pensions, could not have been implemented until autumn anyway.
    At that rate, they would have been of little use for a
political party expecting to call an election in June.
    Also, analysts noted, the budget does not go overboard with
measures that are seen as generous to the wealthy.
    "This will be a difficult budget for the (opposition) Labour
party to attack," Shepherd said.

Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
Lawson's Budget speech was described as sound and well balanced
by analysts, if slightly lacking in excitement.
    A cut in bank base lending rates is now widely expected
tomorrow, with most forecasts predicting a half-point fall. A
follow-up half-point cut is anticipated next week.
    "Worthy but boring would probably sum it up," Peter Fellner,
U.K. Economist at stockbrokers James Capel and Co, said. "It was
a very, very prudent fiscal budget."
    Richard Jeffrey of brokers Hoare Govett said it was a
well-balanced budget within the confines of the government's
philosophy of keeping expenditure levels flat.
    Most analysts said the Budget was very sound on the fiscal
side, but offered nothing new on monetary policy.
    As was widely expected, Lawson split his "fiscal adjustment"
between trimming the 1987/88 PSBR target to 4.0 billion stg
from 7.1 billion and cutting basic rate income tax from 29 to
27 pct.
    The target for the narrow measure of money supply, M0, was
kept unchangd at two to six pct, while the target for the broad
Sterling M3 aggregate was dropped.
    Both Jeffrey and Fellner said the budget clears the way for
a half-point fall in U.K. Base rates tomorrow, but the
authorities are unlikely to sanction a larger cut immediately.
Many analysts and currency dealers have forecast a full
one-point cut tomorrow.
    "The Bank of England will be loathe to take any action which
it will have to reverse later," Jeffrey said, though he added a
further half-point cut was quite possible in the near future.
    The main worry from today's speech is the outlook for
inflation, given the signs of relaxed monetary policy contained
in it, Scrimgeour Vickers economist Richard Holt said.
    Holt noted the "rather loose" inflation forecast of 4.0 pct
at end-1987, and said the lower interest rates likely to result
from the tough fiscal stance could cause longer term concern.
    "A higher PSBR target could be preferable in the long term,"
he said, although lower mortgage interest rates on the back of
falling base rates would have an offsetting impact on
inflation.
    The Budget will inspire a lot of short-term confidence but
it was "not a good budget for inflation," he said
    Jeffrey said he would have liked Lawson to say more about
the dangers of excessive liquidity build-up but overall was not
too concerned about a revival of inflation.
    Fellner noted that the exchange rate was to remain the
"leading edge" of monetary policy, but said the authorities were
likely to be extremely cautious on this front.
    He said they were unlikely to hesitate in holding interest
rates steady or even raising them again if sterling showed any
signs of excessive weakness.
    Most analysts agreed Lawson had bolstered the credibility
of the Budget by adopting realistic forecasts.
    Raising the forecast for the current account deficit from
1.5 to 2.5 billion stg for 1987 would not unsettle the markets,
which are already discounting that amount, Jeffrey said.
that the 4.0 billion stg PSBR target was given credibility by
the favourable outturn for 1986/87, which is now also forecast
to be 4.0 billion stg.
    But analysts said the Budget speech did not give any
clear-cut indication about the timing of the general election,
which has to be held before June, 1988.
    Some believe it signals a poll this June, noting that the
benefits, such as income tax cuts and the decision not to raise
duties on alcohol and tobacco, become available immediately.
    But others said it kept several options open and it was not
possible to deduce too much from it.
    James Capel's Fellner noted that by being fiscally prudent,
Lawson had kept open the possibility of an autumn election in
that there would be no "chickens coming home to roost."
    Richard Jeffrey, who favours the likelihood of a June
election, said it was important the Chancellor had not gone for
a Budget aimed overtly at buying an election victory.
    Nevertheless, he said, it was likely to result in a boost
to the Conservative Party's pre-election popularity.

Taft Broadcasting Co stock rose almost
three points today as its vice chairman and an investment group
proposed to sweeten a takeover offer for the company.
    However, several arbitragers said they would shy away from
the stock at its current price levels since it is unclear how
high bidding for the company would go and whether the company
would agree to a takeover.
    "There are too many uncertainties," said one arbitrager.
    Taft stock rose 2-7/8 to 155-3/4.
    Dudley Taft, Taft vice chairman, and Narragansett Capital
Inc said they sent a letter to the Taft board, stating they
were committed to pursuing acquisition of the broadcast company
and were prepared to negotiate a transaction in excess of 150
dlrs per share.
    The company responded that the proposal would be submitted
to the board of directors, but that no decisions have yet been
made on a sale of the company.
    "Someone's betting this company will go for 170 (dlrs per
share)," said one arbitrager.
    Arbitragers said the stock is a risky buy at current
levels, unless an offer was accepted in the 170 dlr per share
range. They said to make an arbitrage investment at this level
would be chancy since it will take a long time for any
transaction to be completed because of regulatory approvals
necessary for the broadcast properites.
    Taft earlier rejected a 145 dlr per share or 1.35 billion
dlr bid from the investment group. The company said it rejected
the bid as inadequate based on advice of Goldman, Sachs and Co,
its financial adviser. It said it would consider alternatives
such as restructuring.
    Arbitragers speculated a bidding war may erupt for Taft,
which has two large shareholders in an investment group led by
Robert Bass and Carl Lindner, chairman of American Financial
Corp. The Bass group holds 25 pct of Taft and Lindner holds
16.2 pct. The Taft family, which founded the company almost 50
years ago, has about 12 pct.
    Lindner last week told the Securities and Exchange
Commission he may be interested in making a bid for Taft.
    "I could see if things got really crazy that it might go
for 175 (dlrs per share)," said one arbitrager, but he
speculated it probably would not even be taken over for more
than a price in the 160s.
    Another speculated that Lindner might bid, but he
speculated the investor would not really be interested in
running the company. Lindner was unavailable for comment.
    Dennis McAlpine, an analyst with Oppenheimer and Co, said
he had speculated the company might be considering a leveraged
buyout.
    "Ideally, you'd have to break this thing up to satisfy all
the interests involved," he said, adding the two largest
shareholders might be interested in pieces of Taft.
    He said the highest takeover price he calculated for the
company has been about 140 dlrs per share, but that the highest
estimates on Wall Street have been about 160. He said the
latter would be based on more optimistic expectations for the
broadcast industry.

The Bank of France expects a continued
revival in short-term industrial activity, but the outlook for
any improvement in France's record 10.9 pct unemployment rate
remains bleak, the Bank of France said in its monthly review.
    The upturn in activity in all industrial sectors except the
agro-food sector in February more than compensated for the fall
in January, while construction and civil engineering
experienced a recovery which appears likely to extend over the
next few months.
    Internal demand rose and the export situation improved, in
particular toward the European Community (EC), the Bank said.
    Stocks decreases and order book levels, with the exception
of the agro-food industry, improved substantially.
    In addition, retail prices and salaries stabilised last
months.
    Production rose in all sectors except agricultural
machinery and aeronautics, where it stabilised, and ship
construction, where it declined.
    The car industry was the major beneficiary of the upturn in
activity in February, with both domestic and export orders
rising.
    In the consumer goods sector, actitity rose sharply despite
a fall in the household goods sector and stability in
pharmaceuticals.
    Among semi-finished products, output rose sharply, helped
by a strong growth in construction materials.

Energy Secretary John Herrington
said he may recommend to the White House that the domestic oil
industry be given tax benefits to help it produce more oil and
head off increasing U.S. dependence on foreign oil.
    He said also at a news conference that he would recommend
to the White House that the fill rate of the Strategic
Petroleum Reserve be increased from its planned 35,000 barrels
per day.
    The oil reserve fill rate capacity is 100,000 barrels a
day.
    Herrington said he had always advocated a greater fill rate
for the petroleum reserve, but the rate had been kept down
because of budgetary constraints.
    Herrington did not disclose what tax incentives he might
advocate, but U.S. officials have shown interest in tax
benefits for oil and gas exploration and for research and
development into new ways to extract oil which is now
considered uneconomical to produce.
    He made the remarks in conjunction with the release of the
Energy Department's study on oil's impact on national security.
    Herrington said that before he disclosed what
recommendations for tax benefits for the oil and gas industry
he might make, he would raise the matter with the White House
Economic Policy Committee to see if the proposals to increase
oil production made good tax policy.
    He said he would like to increase U.S. production by one
mln barrels a day.
    The report said that by the end of the century the United
States may be relying on foreign sources for 50 pct of its oil
consumption, posing a serious economic and national security
threat.

A White House-ordered report said 
that growing U.S. reliance on foreign oil into the year 2000
could have potentially damaging implications for national
security.
    The Energy Department study discusses several options to
curb reliance on foreign oil, but makes no recommendations.

out a tax on foreign oil as a way to curb imports and to help

years, this report shows that there is justification for
national concern both over declining competitiveness of our
domestic oil and gas industry and over rising oil imports."
    The report said imports last year were 33 pct of U.S.
consumption and by the mid-1990s could rise to 50 pct.
    Among the report's options to ease U.S. reliance on foreign
oil are several already advocated by the Reagan Administration.
    President Reagan ordered the study last September, citing a
determination that the country never again become captive to a
foreign oil cartel, referring to the OPEC-led oil shortages and
sharp prices increases of the 1970s.
    The report said an import fee would raise prices and help
make it economical for U.S. oil firms to find and produce new
oil, as well as to cut imports, but on the whole the tax would
depress the nation's economy.
    The study was outlined in a New York Times report today.

The budget presented by Chancellor of
the Exchequer Nigel Lawson was described by MPs and analysts as
being politically astute, combining tax cuts and fiscal
prudence which promised to boost the Conservative government's
standing with both voters and financial markets.
    The 1987/88 budget contained a two-penny cut in the
standard rate of tax, and a three billion stg reduction in the
Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR), to 4.0 billion stg.
    Parliamentarians said the budget would pave the way for a
fall in domestic interest rates and an early election.
    Conservative MP Anthony Beaumont-Dark said the budget "is
not glamourous - but it is sound and sensible."
    Lawson told journalists later that it was "a budget built on
success, for success."
    But opposition MPs did not agree .
    David Steel, leader of the Liberal Party, said "this was a
strangely deceptive budget.
    The Chancellor had six billion stg to give back - he has
chosen to give half of that to reducing the PSBR, whereas we in
the SDP/Liberal Aliance think it would have been wiser to use
those revenues to reduce unemployment and alleviate poverty."
    Steel said "the cunning thing in this seductive budget is
that all the good things will come in the pre-election period -
the fall in interest rates, the fall in mortgage rates, the
lower income tax, relatively cheaper whisky, beer, cigarettes
and petrol."
    David Owen, the leader of the Social Democratic Party (SDP)
which with the Liberals make up the centrist Alliance grouping,
said "this is a good attempt at an electioneering budget but it
has failed in its objective. It has given money to the "haves" as
opposed to the "have-nots."
    Labour leader Neil Kinnock called it "a bribes budget."
    Kinnock said the budget "had little to do with the general
good, and everything to do with the general election."
    Roy Hattersley, the Labour Party's Treasury spokesman, said
"the Tories should have used available resources to invest in
industry, in health and in education."
    He added that "we know that whoever is elected (to power in
the next general election) will reverse these tax cuts."
    But Lawson rejected that. Rather, he said the Treasury
expected to have at least 3.0 billion stg in fiscal 1988/89 for
use in cutting taxes or raising public spending.
    Lawson rejected claims by opposition MPs that the
government would be forced to call an election by a
deteriorating economy.
    In his financial statement to Parliament, Lawson had said
that "the setting for this year's budget is more favourable than
it has been for many years. We are now entering our seventh
year of steady growth and the fifth in which this has been
combined with low inflation. The public finances are sound and
strong, and unemployment is falling."
    He said that "these are the fruits of the government's
determination, in bad times as well as good, to hold firmly to
our policies of sound money and free markets."
    Lawson later said the Government felt no compulsion to
plump for an early election.
    Asked by political journalists what effect the Budget would
have on election timing, he replied "I think we will hold the
election either late or early. I must confess I am rather
relaxed about it all.
    "There is not any compulsion to go for an early election.
    But he added that "if the Prime Minister decides to go for
an early election, it will bring to an end all this rather
ridiculous pre-election atmosphere and fever - and there is
something to be said for that."
    Industry also welcomed Lawson's budget. Confederation of
British Industry (CBI) President David Nickson said "This budget
will reinforce business success. Lower government borrowing
means lower interst rates for business. This is what the CBI
wanted."
    "We have always said we would judge the budget on how it
affects the cost of borrowing. This should do the trick."

House Ways and Means Committee
chairman Dan Rostenkowski said he was ready to support an 18
billion dlr tax increase to help balance the budget but doubted
it could pass Congress without President Reagan's support.
    Rostenkowski, the chief House taxwriter, said his committee
was reluctant to back a tax increase without certainty that it
would pass the full House and this would require Republican
votes.
    "Chairman Rostenkowski still says its an uphill fight unless
the president signs on," the Illinois Democrat said in remarks
for delivery to the Tax Executives Institute.
    Rostenkowski predicted the tax increase will concentrate on
increases in federal excise taxes while leaving the income tax
intact.
    The taxwriters will not consider delaying the income tax
rate cuts for upper income persons scheduled to take effect in
1988, he said. The top rate will fall from 38.5 pct to 28 pct
next year.
    In addition, he said "they don't have the energy or appetite
to endorse a radical new tax like a VAT (value added tax),"
which he also opposes. "The real question is where the
Republicans will be when the tough vote comes," he said.
    Rostenkowski said his committee will not approve any tax
credits to provide incentives for exports as part of a tax or
trade bill this year.
    He added that no extension or expansion of the research and
development tax credit for business is expected since it would
cost billions of dollars.
    And, Rostenkowski told the tax executives that Howard Baker
as Reagan's chief of staff would make it more likely the White
House will ultimately back a tax increase this year. "There are
strong suspicions that the Baker boys will lead the president
down the slippery slope of moderation," he said.

Surprisingly strong U.S. housing
statistics for February cannot be taken as an indication that
the economy is generating any momentum and are not sufficient
cause to start lifting forecasts for first quarter growth,
economists said.
    Building was boosted by two factors last month, unusually
mild weather and low mortgage rates. But economists said that
seasonal factors make it hard to assess what spur to the
economy, if any, will come from housing in coming months. And
after a steady retreat, mortgage rates seem to be near bottom.
    U.S. housing starts rose 2.6 pct in February to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.851 mln units from 1.804
mln in January. It was the highest pace for starts since April
1986.
    The rate at which permits were issued for future building
climbed 4.4 pct to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.764
mln units after dropping 11.52 pct to 1.690 mln in January.
    "February's weather is usually more adverse for home
building. Because of seasonal factors it's difficult to
determine what this means for the economy down the road," said
Allan Leslie of Discount Corp.
    The housing report is seasonally-weighted to compensate for
weather-related setbacks. As a result, milder temperatures
inflate the statistics.
    Economists said that low mortgage rates also were a spur to
building last month. But several believe that rates will now
consolidate before edging up in late spring/early summer.
    "Builders are looking at current mortgage rates and saying
'Let's do it now'," said Mark Obrinsky of the U.S. League of
Savings Institutions in Washington, whose members supply much
of the financing for home building.
    But Obrinsky doubts that there is much more downward
potential for rates because he foresees higher inflation and 
some overall improvement in the U.S. economy.
    He expects rates to gain 50 to 100 basis points in early
summer from the 9.50 pct fixed rate effective in February. Last
November, fixed rate mortgages were about 10.30 pct.
    As expected, the strength in housing was concentrated in
the single-family sector. The multi-family area -- which
typically represents rental units -- remained weak due to high
vacancy rates and increased capital costs of such units
following tax law changes effective January 1.
    Single-family starts rose at a 5.6 pct annual pace to 1.317
mln units. Multi-family fell 4.1 pct to a 534,000 rate.
    "Strength in the single-family sector indicates that low
mortgage rates are doing their job. But we're probably not
looking at a great deal of growth potential," said Ward
McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
    McCarthy noted that the housing report, together with
larger than expected gains in U.S. employment, industrial
output and retail sales in February, may cause some observers
to start waving "four pct GNP banners" for the first quarter.
Gross national product grew 1.3 pct in the fourth quarter.
    But McCarthy, who still expects first quarter real GNP to
come in at an annual rate of 2.5 pct or slightly above, is not
convinced that growth will pick up in future.
    "The big story is the inventory re-building that's going on
now, not all of which is intentional," he said. For example,
U.S. automakers, who are already saddled with high stocks,
produced at an annual rate of 8.3 mln units in February
compared with domestic car sales of 7.3 mln.
    Thus while inventories could contribute to GNP in the first
quarter, they may result in scaled-back production and weaker
growth in the second, he said.
    "If most of the first quarter growth is inventory building
and we cannot identify any improvement in export demand, then
there is the potential for softness in the second quarter,"
agreed Allan Leslie of Discount Corp. He is still evaluating
first quarter GNP prospects.
    Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker said last week that
current data do not show the worsening in trade has reversed.
    "At the same time that we are pumping up inventories in the
first quarter, we could foresee production slowing in the
second," cautioned Joe Plocek of McCarthy, Crisanti and Maffei
Inc, who expects first quarter growth of about three pct.

The U.K. Government forecasts that oil
revenues will fall to four billion stg in the fiscal year
1987/88, from 4.75 billion in 1986/87 and 11.5 billion in
1985/86.
    The forecast came in the Treasury's Financial Statement and
Budget Report issued after the Chancellor of the Exchequer
Nigel Lawson's annual budget statement to parliament.
    The government is assuming the price of oil will average 15
dlrs a barrel, in line with its earlier forecasts, and its oil
revenue calculation is based on an exchange rate remaining
close to current levels, the Treasury document said.
    The Treasury said the 1987/88 oil revenue shortfall will
reflect the oil price fall of 1986, as North Sea corporation
tax is paid after a time lag.
    The statement calculated that a one dlr a barrel difference
in oil prices this year will change revenue by about 350 mln
stg for the current fiscal year, and 400 mln stg in a full
year.
    Oil production is forecast to fall slightly in 1987,
according to the statement. A change in one mln tonnes in
production would alter revenue by about 45 mln stg in 1987/88
and 50 mln stg in a full year, it added.
    Total general government receipts for 1986/87 are now
estimated to be 159.2 billion stg, 2.75 billion more than the
1986 Budget forecasts and above the Autumn Statement forecasts,
despite a shortfall of 1.25 billlion in oil receipts.
    Additional non-North Sea corporation tax of 1.75 billion
stg and VAT of 750 mln stg account for the bulk of the
overshoot.
    Total general government receipts were forecast to rise to
168.8 billion stg in fiscal 1987/88, and among the main items,
besides diminishing oil revenues, were projected income tax of
40 billion stg, up from 38.4 billion in the current year.
    Non-North Sea corporation tax is forecast to bring in 13.5
billion stg in 1987/88, after the revised 11.2 billion in
1986/87, and VAT revenue should amount to 23.3 billion,
compared with upwardly revised estimated 21.5 billion this
fiscal year.
    The general government expenditure for the coming fiscal
year is expected to total 173.5 billion stg, up from a revised
164.9 billion in the current year.
    A repayment of 800 mln on public corporations' market and
overseas borrowings is forecast to bring the total Public
Sector Borrowing Requirement down to 3.9 billion stg in
1987/88, from this year's revised 4.1 billion, the Treasury
said.

Shares of Reynolds Metals Co rose
sharply after Wall Street firm Furman Selz Mager Dietz and
Birney issued a report focusing on the strong earnings
potential from the company's Australian gold holding, traders
familiar with the report said.
    Traders said the report notes that earnings from Australian
gold holdings could be worth about 35 cts to 55 cts a share
this year and 1.40 dlrs to two dlrs a share in 1988.
    Reynolds Metals rose three points to 59-5/8 on volume of
729,500 shares.
    Reynolds owns stakes in the Mount Gibson gold project and
the Boddington gold project, both located in Australia. An
analyst familiar with the two mines said "the properties,
together, have a potential value of 20 dlrs to 40 dlrs a share
for Reynolds."
    The analyst, who asked not to be identified, said the rise
in the stock today was likely the result of "U.S. investors
that were not completely cognizant of the size or the
importance of the (Reynolds') holdings in Australia."
    Traders said the Furman Selz report indicates that gold was
discovered mixed with bauxite in the Boddington mine.
Boddington is principally a bauxite mine.
    The traders said the report goes on to say that the profits
from the Boddington gold with substantially reduce the
production costs of the other metals mined at Boddington.
    Traders said Furman Selz also boosted its earnings
estimates, expecting Reynolds Metals to earn 4.10 dlr a share
in 1987 and eight dlrs a share in 1988.
    Last year, Reynolds reported net earnings of 8.18 dlrs a
share, which included 3.09 dlrs a share for adoption of new
accounting rules, 1.01 dlrs a share for tax loss carryforwards

Alcan Aluminium Ltd said it may issue
up to two mln first preferred shares in addition to an
unlimited number of additional common shares and an unlimited
number of additional preference shares at any time after its
proposed reorganization.
    In a proxy statement, the company said shareholders are to
vote on the reorganization, which would result in Alcan's
wholly-owned Aluminum Co of Canada Ltd unit replacing Alcan
Aluminium as the group's parent company, at the April 23 annual
meeting. The new company will keep the Alcan Aluminium Ltd
name.
    Alcan said it has no plans to immediately issue any of the
additional shares.
    The company has said it is undertaking the reorganization
mainly to streamline management and give Alcan a stronger and
more stable financing base by making the new Alcan a major
operating company as well as a holding and management company.
    "In an increasingly global capital market, this new
structure should also provide for greater flexibility in

    Alcan's current only outstanding securities are common

The House of Representatives
approved a bill to enable 1987 winter wheat and feedgrains
farmers hit by midwestern flooding last year to receive at
least 92 pct of their federal income support payments even if
they did not plant.
    The one-time pilot 0/92 program, designed to assist farmers
in Kansas, Oklahoma, Michigan and parts of Missouri, was passed
by a 304-100 vote and sent to the Senate.
    Although the bill includes a narrow version of the 0/92
provision endorsed by the Reagan administration, the U.S.
Agriculture Department withheld its support from the measure.
    USDA said the bill would discourage farmers from buying
crop insurance and fall short of the administration's proposed
broad-scale revision of farm programs.
    The bill would permit winter wheat producers prevented from
planting their 1987 crop last fall to receive 92 pct of the
deficiency payments they would have received.
    To be eligible, winter wheat farmers could not plant a
different crop on that land this spring, although they could
use the land for grazing or to plant hay.
    USDA estimated this provision would save 30 mln dlrs,
largely because of reduced crop forfeitures.
    The bill also would aid about 200 feedgrains producers
along the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers who were prevented
from planting crops this year because of residual damage from
last fall's flooding.
    In addition, the measure would require USDA to make full
payment to farmers eligible for emergency assistance approved
by Congress last fall.
    Currently, because claims have outstripped the 400 mln dlrs
in appropriated funds, USDA plans to offer farmers in the
region 74 cents for every dollar in disaster losses.
    The administration said it opposed the bill because, by
expanding the 400 mln dlrs in disaster relief, it would thwart
efforts to encourage farmers to buy crop insurance as an
alternative to federal disaster assistance.
    USDA also said the 0/92 provisions in the bill were
narrower than the administration's proposal to offer the option
to all major commodities and would produce insignificant
savings.
    USDA said the 0/92 option for 1987 winter wheat farmers
would produce a net savings of about 30 mln dlrs, while the
requirement to compensate fully disaster-struck farmers would
cost about 135 mln dlrs, which must be appropriated by
Congress. The feedgrains provision would cost about five mln
dlrs.
    USDA estimated the overall cost of the bill to be 111 mln
dlrs.
    In January the Senate approved a bill that would make 1987
winter wheat farmers eligible for disaster assistance payments.
    But the Senate bill would not offer the 0/92 option to
wheat and feedgrains producers or raise the 400-mln dlr ceiling
on the disaster assistance program.

H.J. Heinz Co is "within sight of our
22nd consecutive year of new records in financial growth" for
the fiscal year ending April 30, Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer Anthony O'Reilly told investment analysts.
    O'Reilly, who declined to make a specific projection, said
the food company is "stronger than at any time in its 118-year
history."
    Last week Heinz reported third-quarter earnings rose to 55
cts a share from 46 cts a share. Sales rose to 1.08 billion
dlrs from 1.01 billion dlrs a year earlier.
    O'Reilly said Heinz will concentrate on backing its big
brands, new products and services, new geography, internal
growth and acquisitions.
    He said Heinz Ketchup has its highest market share in
history, 55 pct. But in response to a question, the executive
said a volume falloff in the overall product category "is a
concern to us."
    O'Reilly said Weight Watchers continues to perform well and
will generate revenue in fiscal 1987 of approximately 940 mln
dlrs.
    O'Reilly told analysts Heinz is in active negotiations to
build a second plant in China, where it entered a joint venture
with the government in 1984, forming Heinz-UFE Ltd, which
produces dry baby food cereal.
    He said Heinz-Japan is "making a profit and generating its
first substantial dividends," and implementation of a new
partnership, Seoul-Heinz Ltd, is moving ahead with a new
manufacturing plant targeted for completion by June in Seoul,
South Korea.
    To increase its competitiveness, O'Reilly said Heinz
implemented a "lowest cost imaginable" program targeted at
manufacturing, sales and marketing and procurement.
    He said a modernization program is in effect at the
company's United Kingdom operations, where the labor force,
trimmed to 4,000 from 10,000, is expected to be further reduced
to 2,500 in 1988.

    Israel G. Grossman, 34, who had been a pension specialist
for the New York firm of Kramer, Levin, Nessen and Kamin,
allegedly stole information from the firm involving the
recapitalization of Colt Industries Inc <COT> last July.
    Grossman, who was arrested February 17, allegedly enabled
three individuals whom he alerted to purchase 1,006 colt call
options for 33,938 dlrs.
    July 21, the day after the Colt recapitalization was
announced, its common stock rose almost 27 points. The options
increased to a value of about 1.5 mln dlrs, according to
Rudolph Giuliani, U.S. Attorney in Manhattan, who announced the
indictment today.
    Grossman is charged with 12 counts of mail fraid and 12
counts of securities fraud. If convicted, he could be sentenced
to a maximum of 120 years in jail and fined a total of six mln
dlrs.
    Grossman resigned from the law firm following his arrest.
He is scheduled to enter a plea March 26.

Allegheny Beverage Corp said it
has been approached by a group interested in acquiring its
foodservice unit, Service America Corp.
    The group includes senior management of Service America but
no officers of Allegheny Beverage, the company said.
    The company has agreed to permit the group and its
potential lenders to perform a due diligence review of Service
America, it said.
    Allegheny noted it had previously cancelled plans to spin
off the foodservice subsidiary.
    The company said the group's review is preliminary and
there is no assurance that an acquisition proposal will be made
or, if made, accepted.
    Service America had fiscal 1986 revenues of about 934 mln
dlrs, or about 83 pct of Allegheny Beverage's total revenues of
1.13 billion dlrs for the year ended March 29, 1986, a
spokesman for Allegheny Beverage said.
    He declined to identify the Service America officials in
the acquisition group.
    On Feb 18, 1987, Allegheny said it was cancelling the spin
off of Service America, but gave no reason for doing so. It
said it would place major emphasis on managing Service America
to improve operations and increase earnings at the unit.
    Service America, which Allegheny acquired in May 1985,
operates cafeterias and food and beverage vending machines.
Through other subsidiaries, Allegheny provides coin-operated
laundry services, building maintenance services and retail
office and furniture operations.
    In fiscal 1986, Allegheny reported earnings from continuing
operations of 8.2 mln dlrs or 1.09 dlrs a fully diluted share,
excluding income of 59.7 mln dlrs from discontinued operations
and an extraordinary loss of 8.1 mln dlrs. In May 1985,
Allegheny sold its Pepsi-Cola Bottling Co unit to Pepsico Inc
<PEP> for 160 mln dlrs.
    Including discontinued operations and the special item, net
income was 59.8 mln dlrs or 6.21 dlrs a share fully diluted.

The Financial Times newspaper said it
has launched a new international share index, which represents
more than 70 pct of the world's total stock market value. The
FT-Actuaries World Indices, published for the first time today,
feature a main world share index and indices plotting the
movement of share prices in different regions and individual
countries, the FT said.
    The first world share indices will be published on an
up-to-date daily basis. The indices are based on the prices of
around 2,400 equity securities from 23 countries.
    Calculated on the same basis as the FT-Actuaries Indices
for UK securities, the indices will be produced daily and
published in the Financial Times. The daily tables have a
series of regional indices together with the overall world
index.
    The FT said its main aim was to provide a set of
measurements against which the performance of international
fund managers could be judged. Markets, companies and
securities have been included only when direct holdings of
shares by foreign nationals are allowed, it said. The FT said
to keep the whole series manageable it has kept the number of
companies from the U.S. To 600.
    The indices are calculated in three seperate currencies -
the US dollar, sterling and the appropriate local currency.
    The regional indices are calculated in a way that takes
into account the relative weight of local capitalisations.The
gross dividend yield is also published on the basis of what
foreign shareholders are entitled to receive before withholding
taxes.
    The FT said it has decided to calculate these numbers after
the enourmous growth in the volume of cross-border equity
investment in recent years.

almost enough savings to reach the 108 billion dlr deficit
target. For fiscal 1988, this would mean total spending of just
over 1 trillion dlrs," Gray said in a statement.
    Gray said his plan would call for a freeze in spending on
each individual federal program at fiscal 1987 levels.
    He said this would mean numerous program cuts, lower
benefits for recipients of federal assistance and fewer people
being served by federal programs.
    Gray said he would make the budget freeze proposal when the
House Budget Committee begins work on the budget resolution
this Thursday. The Senate Budget Committee began work on its
budget resolution this afternoon.

The U.S. Office of Management and
Budget does not have a policy position one way or another on
whether the Agriculture Department's commodity certificate
program should be expanded or contracted, an OMB official said.
    Speaking at the National Grain and Feed Association's
annual convention, Ron Landis, chief of OMB's agricultural
branch, said instead of an across the board policy for or
against certificates, OMB has worked and will continue to work
very closely with USDA in determining how many certificates
should be sent out in each government farm payment.
    "Recent evidence by the General Accounting Office and the
Congressional Budget Office suggest that certificates can and
do increase budget exposure," Landis said.
    But Landis also noted that certificates have numerous
beneficial impacts.
    These benefits are helping maintain U.S. price
competitiveness, freeing up storage space and saving the
government storage and handling costs.
    The major drawback to certificates, said Landis, is that
they increase budget exposure relative to cash through use of
the pik and roll marketing strategy.
    In the pik and roll strategy, a farmer puts his grain under
loan, redeems it with certificates, then keeps the difference
between the price he paid for certificates and the county loan
rate.
    However, if the benefits of certificates outweigh the added
costs, OMB officials said they will support continuation of the
program.
    "OMB says certificates have a very positive effect on the
market, but the question is do those positive benefits outweigh
the added costs. If they do, then the certificate program is
good," an OMB official told

The European Community may decide to
increase the cereals co-responsibility levy and extend its
scope to cover cereal substitutes if the Commission's 1987/88
farm price package is opposed by member states, Edgar Pye,
vice-president of the British agricultural merchants'
association UKASTA, said.
    At the moment the Commission is proposing the rate of levy
remain unchanged at three pct - but Pye, addressing a feed
manufacturers' dinner in Glasgow, said this could change if its
controversial plans to cut cereal prices and introduce an oils
and fats tax are blocked
    Pye said UKASTA would continue to fight the cereals levy
"tooth and nail."

contesting the legality of the current regulation applying the
levy, which is being backed by the EC feed manufacturers'
organisation FEFAC, was not now expected to be heard until the

From April through December 1986,
the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) issued 3.85 billion dlrs
worth of generic certificates and about 1.8 billion had not
been exchanged by January 1, 1987, the U.S. Agriculture
Department said.
    The department said an additional 4.3 billion dlrs in
certificates has been authorized for issuance during
January-August, 1987.
    These certificates will provide ample free supplies of corn
and wheat for the remainder of the crop year, the department
said in a summary of its Agricultural Outlook report.
    Freeing of stocks through certificates is making U.S. grain
more competitive on world markets, it said.
    The department said last summer, for example, certificates
were exchanged for 215 mln bushels of corn. This helped
increase marketable supplies, so farm-level corn prices
averaged about two dlrs per bushel -- somewhat lower than they
would have otherwise.
    The lower prices probably led to an increase in usage of 40
to 50 mln bushels, it said.
    The department said government spending on farm programs in
fiscal year 1987 is projected to fall half a billion dlrs from
1986's 25.8 billion dlrs.
    During 1988 and 1989, the cost escalation of the first half
of the 1980's will reverse. If current policy remains in force,
annual farm program spending by 1992 will be down from last
year's record by more than eight billion dlrs, it said.
    The department said the President's budget proposals for
1988-1992 would cut farm program spending an additional 24
billion dlrs.
    In 1987, foreign economic growth is expected to remain
close to 2.6 pct, the same as in 1986, but above the 2.4 pct
average of 1980-86, it said.
    Partially because of this improvement, U.S. export volume
is expected to rise in fiscal 1987 for the frist time in seven
years, the department said.

An Inland Revenue ruling accompanying
today's U.K. Budget would eliminate a favourable tax treatment
on certain foreign loans by British banks and may be a
"nightmare" of practical application, banking sources said.
    This is because banks will only be able to offset the tax
credit for foreign withholding tax paid on the interest they
receive against the corporation tax on the profit of a specific
loan. Currently, the tax credit is calculated against a banks
profits as a whole.
    For banks, compliance with the ruling could indeed be a
nightmare since they don't fund loans on a individual basis.
    Many of the loans that would be affected by the tax change
are those to less developed countries, such as those in Latin
America. Bankers could not estimate how many loans were
involved expect to suggest it was a "sizable number."
    In a statement, the Inland Revenue said that on loans made
on or after April 1, the new measures would apply to interest
arising from that date. On existing loans at that date, the
measures would apply to interest arising from April 1, 1988.
    Government sources noted that the existing treatment of
withholding tax on interest has enabled some banks to reduce
interest rates on overseas loans, thereby lowering the revenue
to the U.K. Treasury.
    The new measures, they said, are designed to  reduce the
subsidy given to overseas lending through the tax system and
bring the U.K. System more into line with those of overseas
competitors.
    The Inland Revenue estimated that the income to the
Treausry would be negligible in 1987/88 but could build up over
time from about 20 mln stg in 1988/89 to 60 mln stg in 1990/91.
    But while compliance with the new measures could
necessitate hours of clerical work, bankers said the end return
to the Treasury may not prove as lucrative as anticipated.
    They noted that most documentation accompanying these loans
contains a clause allowing for a loan to be restructured if the
tax treatment changes. However, they were unsure to what extent
the loans would and could be changed.
    Bankers said they would seek clarification from the Inland
Revenue, particularly on how to calculate the cost of these
loans. Revenue said it hopes to keep costs of compliance to a
minimum.

agriculture more competitive in export markets while at the

A U.S. Bankruptcy Judge ruled that
<TransAmerican Natural Gas Corp> can not seek an injunction in
Texas State court to block Coastal Corp <CGP> from presenting a
plan of reorganization in TransAmerican's bankruptcy
proceeding.
    However, U.S. bankruptcy judge Manuel Leal also ruled that
TransAmerican could pursue its two billion dlr lawsuit against
Coastal that alleges the Houston based gas company is
attempting to unlawfully gain control of Transamerican's Texas
gas reserve and pipeline system.
    Leal told both Coastal and TransAmerican that he plans to
maintain jurisdiction over TransAmerican's bankruptcy
reorganization proceedings that began in 1983.
    After the hearing, John Nabors, a lawyer for TransAmerican,
said the company would pursue its state court lawsuit seeking
2.0 billion dlrs in damages from Coastal.
    Nabors contends that Coastal has unlawfully attempted to
replace TransAmerican's negotiated reorganization plan paying
secured creditors in full with a plan of its own.
    "They're not going to pay any money under their plan,
they're just going to operate (the gas wells) and give profit
to the creditors," Nabors said.
    He said Coastal's plan, which has not yet been submitted to
the Bankruptcy Court, offered to pay creditors 50 mln dlrs
annually for seven years.
    TransAmerican's plan would repay a total of 770 mln dlrs in
debts to secured creditors and the equivalent of 30 cts on the
dollar to unsecured creditors.
     A Coastal unit is among Transamerican's unsecured
creditors and is owed about 600,000 dlrs.
    Transamerican said it is the second largest producer of
natural gas in Texas with reserves of 1.2 trillion cubic feet
and more than 1,000 miles of pipeline and gas gathering lines.
    Coastal, one of the nation's largest gas producers, earned
71.6 mln dlrs on sales of 6.7 billion dlrs in 1986.

The National Association of Securities
Dealers said all stock exchanges should require that listed
companies adopt a "one-share, one-vote" rule, but with a few
exceptions.
    In a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission, NASD
President Gordon Macklin said the group would be happy to be
the first exchange to adopt a uniform rule but with certain
exceptions.
    "Clearly the NASD would willingly be the first to do so. If
a voluntary private sector resolution is not practical, then
the commission should adopt the rule to apply to all markets,"
the NASD said.
    An NASD study found that 95 percent of the companies in the
OTC offered only one class of stock.
    The NASD proposal calls for all stock markets to have a
uniform rule which would emphasize the principle of equal
voting rights, but allow for legitimate variations.
    The NASD would allow companies to issue shares that do not
have voting rights as long as the limitation is clearly spelled
out to investors. It wants to prevent listed companies from
turning voting shares into non-voting shares, without
shareholder approval, Parrillo said.
    "A uniform rule should be written to cure what has been
construed by some to be an abusive practice involving the use
of stock with other than full voting rights," the association
said in the statement.
    Exceptions would include:
    -- shares in a registerd public offering where all facts
connected with the company's capital structure are clearly
spelled out in the prospectus.
    -- shares issued in connection with a merger, acquisition
or recapitalization where the exchange of shares is accompanied
by detailed proxy material.
    The NYSE rule would allow companies to have a dual class of
stock only if a majority of publicly held shares and a majority
of independent directors on the board approve the move. The
NYSE has allowed its few listed companies which have dual
classes to continue trading, pending approval from the SEC.
    The NASD specifically wants to disallow issuance of dual
class shares where those with superior voting rights are not
resalable. Parillo said such a provision would in effect
prevent a firm from ever being purchased by anyone else.

"Endaka," the strong yen, has usurped
"Godzilla Versus the Sea Monster" as Japan's favourite horror
story.
    The yen's 40 pct surge against the dollar over the last two
years has frightened foreigners with tales of the 40 dlr melon,
the 120 dlr taxi ride from the airport and rents of 15,000 dlrs
a month.
    But "endaka," like many Japanese products, is for foreign
consumption, locals and long-time foreign residents said.
    "It's not really that expensive. I don't pay attention to
the cost of living," said Cheryl Richmond, a 25-year-old
Canadian teacher of English in Tokyo.
    Richmond said she earns 1,635 dlrs a month by "chatting" 40
hours a week in English to Japanese who hope to learn the
language. For 326 dlrs a month she rents a sunny, quiet
two-room flat some 20 minutes by train from Shinjuku, one of
Tokyo's prime business and entertainment districts, and has
managed to send home an average of 320 dlrs a month.
    She spends less than 6.50 dlrs a day on food despite eating
out once a day.
    "For lunch I buy the teishoku (daily special) which comes
with soba (buckwheat noodles) or pork cutlet, pickles, miso
soup, rice and tea," although she takes only coffee for
breakfast and a sandwich for dinner.
    No one argues that Tokyo is cheap, but long-time residents
see no need to spend the 2,000 to 15,000 dlrs a month spent by
foreign firms to house executives in Western-style homes.
    The companies feel otherwise. They say they must pay the
price to bring over the best people needed to back up their
push into Japan's increasingly lucrative markets.
    "You can't expect people to move from New York or Sydney and
trade down. It's not reasonable," said a spokesman for
International Business Machines Corp (IBM), which supports
Western lifestyles for more than 350 foreigners in Tokyo.
    Tokyo is the world's most expensive city for business
travellers, a survey issued this month by Employment Conditions
Abroad said. It found that businessmen visiting Tokyo spend on
average more than 300 dlrs a day.
    While the businessmen have little choice but to come here,
many tourists, especially those from Europe, are opting to
visit sunnier and cheaper climes in Southeast Asia.
    The Japan Tourist Bureau estimates "endaka" caused an 11.5
pct drop in the number of foreign visitors to Japan last year.
    Those who came tried to cut back on expenses, chiefly by
curtailing shopping, it said.
    To help combat "endaka" and the slump in tourism, the Tourist
Bureau prepared a pamphlet, "Economical Travel in Japan."
    It gives budget-saving tips on finding medium-priced
business hotels and Japanese-style inns, cheap sushi and public
baths while getting a "revealing glimpse of Japanese in their
daily lives."
    Residents of Okubo House, a transit hotel in Tokyo's
Shin-Okubo love hotel district, offer even more savvy advice.
    For 9.80 dlrs a night, Scott Perry, a 23-year-old budding
English teacher from New Zealand, shares an unheated,
berth-sized twin-room in the Japanese "flop house."
    Perry has budgeted 26 to 33 dlrs a day while he looks for
work. "Normally I eat 'teishoku' for 400 yen but sometimes I'll
splurge at Shakey's where for 550 yen you can eat unlimited
pizza for at least two hours."
    Still, there are the extras that dent the budget. "I had to
spend 600 yen today to dry-clean my suit coat," he said.

Global trading of yen bond futures is
just around the corner and they are expected to be listed soon
on the London International Financial Futures Exchange (LIFFE)
and the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT), bond managers said.
    "Internationalisation of the yen through expansion of
overseas portfolios in yen assets is the key to the success of
global trading of yen bond futures," said Katsuyuki Okayasu,
general manager of Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd's bond division.
    "But Tokyo-based orders are necessary for a primary stimulus
for the LIFFE yen bond futures market," said Tetsuya Dezuka,
deputy general manager of the money market section of New Japan
Securities Co Ltd, one of the most active yen bond brokers in
London.
    Healthy growth of yen bond futures markets depends
basically on substantial liquidity in cash yen bond markets
overseas and on the yen becoming attractive to traders there,
dealers said.
    Outstanding yen cash bonds worldwide stand at around
140,000 billion yen, with most held in Japan, they said.
    An agreement between CBOT and LIFFE in early February on
mutual settlements is expected to link U.S. Treasury bond
futures trading in London and Chicago, enabling a continuous
12-hour session, bond managers here said, adding the move was
made with yen bond futures trading in mind.
    LIFFE is preparing for an early listing of yen bond futures
after receiving approval from Japan's Finance Ministry last
December.
    But futures markets will never take root unless they are
backed by substantial liquidity in cash bond markets, dealers
said.
    Daily transactions in the London yen cash bond market now
stand at 200 to 300 billion yen, but the extent of investor-
linked transactions is unknown, securities bond managers said.
    "Japanese corporations have been actively setting up their
financing companies in London, suggesting they increasingly are
engaging in, not only fund raising, but management there,"
Dezuka said.
    The steep increase in the number of branches of Japanese
securities houses in London and the growing numbers of U.S. And
U.K. Brokers coming to Tokyo has helped the London market's
growth, dealers said.
    Internationalisation of the yen is also likely to be
promoted by yen bond trading in Chicago and New York later this
year, securities managers said.
    The recent removal of a key regulatory obstacle by the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission will allow the CBOT to apply
to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission for a yen bond
futures contract, they said.
    The ruling removed a regulation which prohibited trading
futures of designated foreign government debt securities not
located in the issuing country.
    Fundamental Brokers Inc, a major U.S. Brokers' broker, has
decided to launch yen bond broking on its display system in New
York as early as April.
    CBOT's start of an evening session, planned for the end of
April, will also multiply yen bond futures trading, a Nomura
Securities Co Ltd bond manager said. But there are still
obstacles to trading on the London market.
    "Problems concerning cash bond delivery and clearing are
major obstacles for an early launching at LIFFE," said Koki
Chiyojima, deputy general manager of Nikko Securities Co Ltd's
bond administration division.
    Nikko Securities Co Ltd, one of the big four Japanese
securities houses, is responsible for corresponding with LIFFE
on these matters.
    Japan's Finance Ministry will start issuing bonds with
coupon payment of either March and September, or June and
December from April 1, matching futures delivery months.
    The ministry now pays coupons in January, June, July and
December. When delivery months and coupon payments do not
match, a 20 pct withholding tax is imposed on interest earned
by non-resident bond holders, a deterrent to LIFFE, securities
managers said.
    LIFFE is likely to wait until the outstanding amount of
bonds with matching months increases to over several billion
yen, bond managers said.
    These bonds will be used for deliveries, as they are
expected to be the cheapest deliverable issues due to low
interest rates, they said.
    Market participants here expect a clearing organisation to
be set up by the time they have substantial deliverable cash
issues, making overseas listings probable in the latter half of
1987.

Conditions on the floating rate note
market appeared to be returning gradually to normal today with
prices static to a little better generally, dealers said.
    The market was showing limited signs of recovery from the
collapse in trading last night and the calmer tone was
reinforced this morning as the first significant retail orders
for some time emerged, one senior FRN trader noted.
    In fixed rate bonds, the tone was likewise quietly firmer
with euroyen and eurosterling maintaining their recent bullish
trend and activity in dollar straight and ECU-denominated bonds
also picking up slowly.
    Although a handful of FRN market makers were expected to
remain on the sidelines for the time being, dealers noted a
tangible return of retail interest from the Far East, lured
back by extremely attractive yields and bargain prices.
    "We are seeing from Singapore, and from Japan clients keen
to use up their quotas for purchase of particular instruments
before the end of the fiscal year," the senior trader added.
    Any investors not buying to their full limit would run the
risk of having that limit reduced next year, he explained.
    However, he pointed out that mainly sovereign paper was in
demand with U.S. Bank sector paper largely ignored.
    Prices of reasonable quality floaters had firmed by an
average of 10 basis points in early trading but FRN dealers
cautioned that the mood was still nervous.
    "If prices rise by too much too quickly, everyone is more
than well-aware of the danger the selling could set in again,"
commented another FRN market source at a large Japanese house.
    The other sector commanding market attention today was
eurosterling, which soared in line with U.K. Government bonds.
    Both markets were pushed higher by an ebullient pound and
renewed buying by U.K. Institutions following Chancellor of the
Exchequer's Nigel Lawson's well-received budget yesterday.
    "This was definitely a budget for lower sterling interest
rates," said a sterling analyst at a U.K. Merchant bank.
    "It has been exceptionally well-received by the city, looks
good to foreign investors and we are sure to see a rush to tap
the eurosterling markets now," he added.
    News that next year's Public Sector Borrowing Requirement
will be held at 4.0 billion stg from an earlier projected 7.0
billion was influential for fixed rate stg investment markets.
The government's reduced need to tap the gilt-edged markets
will create a perennial shortage of stock, maintaining upward
pressure on prices, a sterling bond dealer commented.
    This could further boost demand for eurosterling bonds, as
long as yield margins remain attractive in relation to gilts --
often the case with newer, if not with more seasoned issues.
    Bullish predictions on the U.K.'s general economic health
were also expected to boost foreign interest in eurosterling.
    Market sources said attention would now switch to
monitoring the fortunes of the ruling Conservative party in
opinion polls ahead of a widely-anticipated general election.
    Although several new sterling deals are expected, in early
trading the only sterling denominated one to emerge was a 30
mln convertible deal for British Land Co Plc.
    Other new deals this morning reflected the recent primary
market trend with little activity in dollar-denominated issues
although the currency sectors were busy.
    Hot on the heels of yesterday's two Canadian dollar issues
was a 75 mln dlr six-year bond for Chrysler Credit Canada,
guaranteed by Chrysler Finance paying 9-1/4 pct and priced at
101-1/2 pct.
    A 15 billion euroyen issue was launched for Associates Corp
of North America paying five pct at 102-3/8 pct due 1992. A
similar euroyen offering was reported to be in the market for a
Scandinavian borrower. Details were not immediately available.

Turner and Newall Plc said it planned to
raise a net 71.7 mln stg with a one-for-six rights issue of
36.15 mln shares.
    The shares would be offered at 205p, compared with Turner's
price which fell to 227p from last night's close at 241p.
    The group said the funds would be used to cut borrowings,
which had risen to 234 mln stg at end-February, largely as a
result of the takeover of <AE Plc>.
    The company also reported pretax profits rising to 44.7 mln
stg from 39.6 mln previously.
    It noted that the purchase of AE involved the payment of
some 125 mln stg cash as well as taking on AE's own borrowings
of some 85 mln stg. The net debt/equity ratio at the year end
had risen to 59 pct from 23 pct the year before, it added. The
rights issue would cut borrowings and also allow further
development through investment and acquisition.
    But it said that the purchase of AE -- which was won after
a long and acrimonious battle last year -- greatly strengthened
the group's position in the automotive components and
engineering materials sectors.
    In the 15 months to end-1986 AE produced pretax profits of
27.4 mln stg compared with 25.6 mln in the 12 months
previously.
   As the offer for AE was not declared unconditional until
December 5, it made a negligible contribution to Turner's 1986
results.
    Turner said the prospects were good and it looked forward
to taking advantage of the opportunities available.
   1986 operating profits were higher in all areas apart from
Zimbabwe mines, which were hit by the strength of the local
currency against the dollar.

The sale of the government's 25.55 pct

sources closely linked with the transaction said.
    A spokesman for the Finance Ministry said no exact date had
yet been set for the privatisation, which the government has

scandal at Volkswagen AG <VOWG.F>, VW, over currency losses "has
nothing to do" with the timing of the VEBA sale.
    Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg has said the sale of
the Federal government's stake in VW, originally scheduled for

    This banker said there would be no reason to postpone the
issue of the 10 mln VEBA shares for a few days. He added that
the consortium which is arranging the deal had completed its
preparatory work, although the price had not been decided.
    The VEBA share has been weaker ahead of the placement but
West German stocks have been generally bearish and news of the
VW scandal last week put further pressure on the market.

Sony Corp <SNE.T> group net income is
expected to be down 65 pct for the five months ending March 31
from the same period a year ago at around 10 billion yen, if
the yen&#127;dollar rate remains at the present level, managing
director Tsunao Hashimoto told a press conference.
    Sony will have an irregular five-month business term ending
March 31, as its financial year will be changed to run from
April 1 to March 31 from the current October 31 year end.
    Group sales in the same period are estimated at about 550
billion yen, down five pct from a year earlier, he said.
    The company earlier reported net income of 7.65 billion yen
in the three month period ended January 31, down 59.2 pct from
a year earlier, on sales of 343.06 billion, down 6.3 pct.
    The gloomy profits and sales resulted from the yen's recent
appreciation against the dollar and a sharp drop in market
prices due to severe sales competition at home and abroad.
    The yen rose 26 pct to an average of 159 yen to the dollar,
reducing the company's total sales in the three month period by
40 billion yen, Hashimoto said.
    Sales of 8-mm video camera/recorders totalled 300,000 units
in the three months, unchanged from a year earlier, while
Beta-format video tape recorders (vtrs) sales fell to 300,000
from 350,000. Sales of compact disc players rose to 450,000
from 300,000 and those of the Walkman rose to 2.25 mln from
1.30 mln but colour television sales fell to 950,000 from one
mln due to lower exports to China.
    Sales of 8-mm vtrs had already exceeded Beta-format vtrs
sales since the beginning of fiscal 1986, Hashimoto said.
Overseas sales accounted for 68.2 pct of the total in the three
months compared with 71.3 pct a year earlier.
    Overseas production will account for 35 pct of its total
production in 1990 from the present 20 pct.
    Hashimoto also said parent current profit in the five-month
period is estimated at around 17 billion yen, down 33 pct from
a year earlier, on sales of 400 billion, down 12 pct.
    Sony is hoping to retain at least 1985/86 levels of group
net profits and sales in the new financial year starting April
1 1987, he added. The company made 41.9 billion yen group net
profit in the year ended November 31 1986, down 42.6 pct from a
year earlier, on sales of 1,325 billion, down 6.7 pct.

Deutsche Babcock AG
<DBCG.G> said an issue price of 165 marks had been set on a
two-for-five rights issue of shares which will raise nominal
capital by 100 mln marks to 350 mln marks.
    The subscription period for the offer runs from March 26 to
April eight, it added.
    Babcock shares opened at 222.2 marks in Frankfurt after a
close of 226 yesterday. Babcock, which has set an unchanged
three mark a share dividend on 1985/86 business, announced last
week that Iran was selling its 25.2 pct holding in the company.
These shares will be placed with institutional investors.
    The rights issue will bring Deutsche Babcock 330 mln marks,
which share market analysts said was likely be used partly to
finance expansion, especially in environment technology.
    However, one analyst who follows the stock for a major
Frankfurt bank said the capital increase would also be used to
bring capital ratios back into order after the company suffered
heavy losses in the early 1980s.
    This analyst said Babcock had used reserves to cover these
losses, which were due to problems linked with three major
contracts in the Middle East. The parent company made a net
loss in the year to end-September 1982 of 389 mln marks.
    Deutsche Babcock has not yet presented details of its
results in the 1985/86 period, but it has said profits rose
from the group net of 32.1 mln marks in 1984/85.
    The share market analysts saw no particular problems in the
pricing of the new Babcock shares but said the timing was
unfortunate.
    The government is planning to sell its 25.55 pct stake in
VEBA AG <VEBG.F> this month, in a transaction worth a likely
2.5 billion marks. The Babcock rights issue also coincides with
a large capital increase by the Aachener und Muenchener
insurance group.
    The heavy volume of new stock coming on to the market has
generally put pressure on West German stocks which have also
suffered because of export problems caused by the high mark.
    Analysts have linked the pending capital increase with
Iran's decision to sell its holding in Babcock, held since
1975.
    When the Iranian decision was announced last week, the
market took the news calmly. Analysts said today the
combination of the Iranian sale and the rights issue would not
have a negative effect on the Babcock share because the direct
placement of the Iranian holding with institutional investors
both in Germany and abroad would shield the price from falls.

A parliamentary boycott by opposition
members has forced the government to compile its largest-ever
provisional budget, finance ministry officials said.
    The 7,900 billion yen budget for the first 50 days of
fiscal 1988 starting April exceeds the previous record of 3,040
billion yen for an 11-day budget in fiscal 1984.
    An on-again, off-again parliamentary boycott by opposition
parties over a proposed five pct sales tax has prevented
passage of the full 1987/88 budget within the current year
ending March 31.
    The stop-gap budget, which is expected to pass parliament
on March 31, is designed to respond to mounting calls for
economic stimulus from domestic industries, hard hit by the
yen's sharp rise, officials said.
    It will include as much as 1,800 billion yen for public
works, about 30 pct of the 6,000 billion yen earmarked for such
works in the full budget. Traditionally, a provisional budget
covers only day-to-day mandatory expenses.
    The government also expects the budget to meet pressure
from trading partners for an expansion of Japanese domestic
demand, they said.
    The budget includes expenditures for a program to create
300,000 jobs and other reflationary measures, the officials
said.
    They quoted ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) secretary
general Noboru Takeshita as telling opposition party officials
yesterday that the budget should include as much pump-priming
as possible.
    Economists said confidence of opposition members in their
campaign to scrap the sales tax has been heightened by their
success in forcing the adoption of a stop-gap budget and could
lead to even further delays in passing the full budget.
    The result may be that the government will have to delay
its planned announcement of a set of pump-priming measures in
April, economists said.
    That package is expected to include a plan to carry out
more than 80 pct of total 1987/88 public works in the first
half of the fiscal year, a government official said.
    Japanese press reports said some LDP executives suggested
Nakasone may have to give up plans to visit Washington in April
because of the sales tax confrontation. Nakasone hopes to meet
President Reagan to prepare for the economic summit of seven
major industrial democracies in June, they added.

Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson
said he was content with the current level of sterling and
welcomed today's announcement of a further half point cut in
British bank base lending rates to 10 pct.
    However, he said he wanted to see a gradual approach to
declines in domestic U.K. Interest rates, although optimism in
financial markets might push for big moves quickly.
    He told a briefing of economic journalists that "I don't
think we should rush anything." Lawson stressed the themes of
"gradualism and steadiness" as economic policy.
    Lawson acknowledged that today's fall in interest rates
were in response to his budget for fiscal 1987/88, unveiled
yesterday to Parliament and which set a lower target for the
key Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR) of 1.0 pct of
GDP.
    Lawson said the two recent cuts in base rates, both made
this month in the form of half percentage point declines, were
"perfectly consistent" with monetary conditions now in Britain.
    He supported that by saying the narrow M0 money supply
aggregate was "safely inside" its flucuation band of two to six
pct set for both 1986/87 and 1987/88. In his budget, Lawson set
no explicit target range for the broader sterling M3.
    Turning to the question of Britain eventually joining the
exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System (EMS),
Lawson repeated that "it is most unlikely we will enter before
the next election."
    He said Britain was keeping the subject of full EMS
membership under constant review. But he would not indicate
what the chief considerations for this were for the government.
    Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher late last year said a
decision on whether or not to join depended on the strength of
the U.K. Economy. But she later said such a move depended on
other EMS countries scrapping residual capital controls.
    Although Lawson denounced what he said was "the current wave
of election fever" in Britain, he added:  "It is more likely that
there will be an election this year" than not.
    He said he supported an early election only because it
would clear the air. "Ideally, we (the government) should have a
full term," but events could force a premature poll, Lawson
said.
    The government, which has been in power since 1979, must
call an election by June 1988. Speculation is rising for either
a June or an early autumn election, political sources said.
    The decision to cut basic tax by only two pence in 1987/88
"was the right balance, economically and politically," he said.
    Lawson's decision to restrict the fall in the standard rate
of tax to two-pence surprised many analysts, who had predicted
that with Treasurys coffers full of tax revenue would have
allowed the government to reach its goal of 25 pct in one move.
    But it was being praised today by political analysts as a
shrewd move which, while advancing towards that aim, could not
be seized upon by opposition parties as overtly trying to bribe
the electorate.
    Lawson told journalists he had been surprised by how much
the PSBR had undershot his original assumption of 7.1 billion
stg for 1986/87 -- by some three billion stg.
    Returning to changing levels of interest rates, Lawson
stressed that "they are not an objective (for the government) -
they are an instrument of policy." Consequently the Treasury had
no precise target for domestic borrowing levels, he said.
    But "there may be interest rate consequences" from changes in
the level of government borrowing, he added.
    Lawson said he did not think that the U.K.'s relatively
high level of real interest rates had hurt investment in
Britain.
    He said conditions created by London's role as a leading
financial centre had caused sterling interest rates to be
higher in real terms than in other countries.
    Three factors had caused the higher level in relative
interest rates in Britain, Lawson said.
    First, control of credit in Britain rested on interest
rates alone, due to the freedom of its financial markets.
    He said the second reason was political uncertainty caused
by proposed spending plans of the opposition Labour Party.
     Thirdly, he said "we do not have as long a track record of
low inflation" as did the U.S., Japan and West Germany.
    Lawson foresaw London becoming the world's pre-eminent
financial centre, because it was more international in
character and more favourably placed in time zones than New
York or Tokyo.

    The company said it is now entitled to subscribe for all
the authorised but unissued and unreserved shares of common
stock of Cyclops, which total some 5.4 mln shares, at 90.25
dlrs each.
    Dixons said it has waived its condition that 80 pct of the
fully diluted outstanding shares be validly tendered and not
withdrawn.
    Dixons launched the agreed 384 mln dlr offer on February 17
this year in the wake of its unsuccessful battle to take over
the U.K. Retail store chain Woolworth Holdings Plc <WLUK.L>.
    Dixons shares were last quoted at 390p, up on last night's
close of 380p.
    On Friday, <CYACQ Corp>, an investor group formed by
Audio/Video Affiliates Inc <AVA> and Citicorp <CCI>, said it
would increase the price it was offering for all Cyclops shares
to 92.50 dlrs from 80.00 dlrs each if Cyclops would provide it
with confidential information given to Dixons and if it were
satisfied that any rights Dixon might have to recover fees or
expenses from Dixons or to buy Cyclops stock would be rescinded
or proved invalid.
    Audio/Video's offer is scheduled to expire March 20.

An on-off parliamentary boycott has

    Economic analysts saw this as another setback in Nakasone's
plans to overhaul the Japanese tax system.
    The parliamentary boycott by opposition parties over
Nakasone's plans for a five per cent sales tax has made it

International Cocoa Organization (ICCO)
producers and consumers accepted the principles of a compromise
proposal on buffer stock rules as a basis for further
negotiation, delegates said.
    The buffer stock working group then asked ICCO Executive
Director Kobena Erbynn, who wrote up the draft compromise, to
flesh out details of the principles with the assistance of a
representative group of delegates, they said.
    The working group broke up for the day, into a smaller
group of five producers and five consumers to discuss
administrative rules and into the group headed by Erbynn to
hammer out buffer stock rules details, delegates said.
    Delegates said many differences of opinion still have to be
ironed out. "Whenever we start getting into details the clouds
gather," one delegate said.
    Erbynn is likely to present fleshed out details of the
buffer stock rules proposal to the working group early
tomorrow, delegates said.
    The principles of the draft proposal included establishing
an offer system for buffer stock purchases rather than a posted
price system, a limit to the amount of non-ICCO member cocoa
that can be bought, and differentials to be paid for different
varieties of cocoa comprising the buffer stock, delegates said.

<General Partners>, controlled by
privately-held Wagner and Brown and by AFG Industries Inc, said
it has started a tender offer for all common shares of GenCorp
Inc and associated defensive preferred share purchase rights
for 100 dlrs a share.
    GenCorp stock closed yesterday in composite tape trading at
90.50 dlrs a share, up two dlrs on the day.
    In a newspaper advertisement, General Partners said the
offer and withdrawal rights expire April 14 unless extended.
    General Partners said the offer is conditioned on receipt
of sufficient financing to buy all shares on a fully diluted
basis and receipt of enough shares to give General Partners at
least 51 pct voting power, again fully diluted.
    It said the offer is also conditioned on GenCorp redeeming
the defensive rights or General Partners being satisfied that
the rights have been invalidated and General Partners obtaining
from the Federal Communications Commission a special temporary
authorization allowing completion of the acquisition of GenCorp
shares.
    General Partners said it would set up voting trust
arrangements pending review of its long-form application for
FCC approval of its acquisition of control of GenCorp's
broadcasting subsidiary.
    The partnership said the offer is further conditioned on
GenCorp management withdrawing its proposals to amend the
company's articles of incorporation and code of regulations to
provide for an increase in authorized common shares, a
classified board of directors and the elimination of cumulative
voting.  The latter two changes would make it harder for
minority shareholders to elect directors.
    General Partners said it is asking GenCorp for its
shareholder lists for help in disseminating the offer.
    GenCorp has about 22.3 mln shares outstanding, making the
value of the offer about 2.23 billion dlrs.
    Last fall, AFG and Wagner and Brown offered to acquire
<Lear Siegler Inc> for about 1.44 billion dlrs but withdrew the
offer when higher bids emerged and due to complications of the
Tax Reform Act of 1986.  Lear Siegler eventually went private
for 1.66 billion dlrs.
    GenCorp is involved in tire and plasticmaking and aerospace
as well as broadcasting.  The company faces challenges to its
two television and 12 radio station licenses, partly becuase it
failed to inform the FCC about allegedly improper foreign
payments and political contributions.
    GenCorp has agreed to sell its New York-area television
station WOR to MCA Inc <MCA> for 387 mln dlrs and its Los
Angeles station KHJ to Walt Disney Co <DIS> for 217 mln dlrs.
An investor group challenging the Los Angeles license would
also receive 103 mln dlrs from Disney.
    For the year ended November 30, GenCorp earned 130 mln dlrs
on sales of 3.10 billion dlrs.
    A GenCorp spokesman said the offer came as a surprise and
the company was not yet in a position to comment on the bid.

The Bundesbank is likely to steer a
steady monetary course over the next few weeks and a change in
credit policies is not expected at tomorrow's regular central
bank council meeting, bank economists and dealers said.
    "There is no need for action," Hermann Remsperger, chief
economist of Berliner Handels- and Frankfurter Bank (BHF) said.
    Others noted that exchange rates are stable after last
month's Group of Six agreement in Paris and central bank money
stock growth is still well above the three to six pct target
zone, so a change in credit policies could be ruled out.
    One money market dealer said comments by Bundesbank
President Karl Otto Poehl at a private seminar in Duesseldorf
two weeks ago hinting at another interest rate cut only
indicated the Bundesbank might act if conditions changed.
    Bank economists said U.S. Pressure on West Germany to
further ease credit policies had receded since the Paris pact.
    But such demands could re-emerge if West Germany failed to
stimulate its economy enough to affect the massive U.S. Trade
deficit.
    Remsperger said continued strong money supply growth also
precluded a further cut in official interest rates.
    Central bank money stock was growing at an annualized 7.5
pct in February, unchanged from the 7.5 pct in January.
    Economists said some of the 18 members of the central bank
council were worried about the continued overshoot in the money
supply target and were bound to resist any moves to cut rates.
But Poehl played down the risk of inflation.
    Economists said the fact that money stock growth remained
stable last month was a success. Some said it was likely to
return to within the target range later this year.
    "The special factors which boosted money supply growth last
year are disappearing," one economist said.
    He said some 75 pct of the money supply increase in 1986
was caused by a sharp rise in the inflow of foreign funds.
    This trend had been reversed recently and with domestic
credit demand likely to remain at steady levels, money stock
growth was expected to narrow in the medium-term.
    These developments were increasing the Bundesbank's scope
for a rate cut in the medium-term, economists said.
    Money market dealers said period rates remained little
changed, indicating no change in credit policy was expected.
    Call money rates declined to 3.75/80 pct from 3.90/95
yesterday, with the market well stocked with liquidity.
    Dealers said call money was soft because tax payments on
behalf of customers had been less than expected so far. But
rates were likely to tighten again as soon as the full effect
of this month's major tax payment period is felt. Payments for
the federal railways bond are also likely to burden the market.
    The Bundesbank did not inject liquidity via a securities
repurchase agreement this week, but countered a tightening in
rates on Monday by injecting funds through government-owned
banks.
    Dealers said recent securities repurchase pacts had shown
the Bundesbank clearly wanted call money rates stable at 3.80.
    One dealer said, "If the central bank wanted lower interest
rates, it would first of all drive call money rates down."
    Banks remained relatively well stocked with minimum reserve
assets. They held 52.9 billion marks in minimum reserves on
Monday, averaging 53.7 billion marks over the first 16 days of
March. A requirement of around 51 billion is expected.

The U.S. Gross National Product,
after removing the impact of inflation, increased at a revised
annual rate of 1.1 pct in the fourth quarter, the Commerce
Department said.
    That was down from an earlier preliminary 1.3 pct rise
estimated a month ago and down from the 2.1 pct rise in the
fourth quarter of 1985.
    The final fourth quarter revision, however, left unchanged
the previous estimate of a 2.5 pct increase in GNP for all of
1986 over 1985.
    The revised estimate for fourth quarter GNP partly
reflected a downward revision in inventories to a total
decrease of 28.5 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter, the
department said.
    The revisions also indicated personal consumption spending
decreased 2.2 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter after an
increase of 39.6 billion dlrs in the third quarter.
    Exports of goods and services rose 15.3 billion dlrs after
a decline of 9.4 billion dlrs in the third quarter. Imports
decreased 700 mln dlrs in the final quarter, in contrast to an
increase of 20.9 billion dlrs in the third quarter.

West German commercial banks are
cautiously cutting key savings and lending rates, banking
sources said. The cuts follow nearly two months after the
Bundesbank reduced leading interest rates, far longer than the
usual interim period.
    A Deutsche Bank AG <DBKG.F> spokesman said it is cutting
leading savings rate for private customers on a regional basis
by 0.5 percentage points to two pct. Dresdner Bank AG <DRSD.F>
and Commerzbank AG <CBKG.F> have initiated similar moves. Bank
fuer Gemeinwirtschaft AG <BKFG.F> cut rates 0.5 pct generally.
    The delay was partly due to commercial banks' desire to
gauge customer reaction to a similar move by regional savings
banks.
    A fall in customer savings because of lower rates could
reduce cheap refinancing available to banks, forcing them to
draw down relatively expensive funds from other sources, one
economist at the German Banking Association said.
    But the volume of savings funds may not be substantially
undercut by lower savings rates because many customers are
parking funds in savings accounts in the hope they can reinvest
them at higher yields in the future, he said.
    He said this may conflict with Bundesbank aims to move more
funds from relatively short-term deposits to longer-dated
securities to reduce strong growth in its central bank money
supply aggregate.
    The aggregate showed annualized growth of a provisional 7.5
pct in February against the fourth quarter of last year,
unchanged from January. The growth rate was outside the
expanded target range of three to six pct.
    Few banks have so far reduced lending rates to private
customers, though lending rates for corporate customers are
beginning to decline.

Rhodes Inc said it now estimates fourth
quarter, ended February 28, earnings were eight cts a share,
down from the 25 cts earned in the final quarter of fiscal
1986.
    The company said the major causes for the reduction were an
unfavorable LIFO adjustment and softer than projected sales in
the quarter, due primarily to unfavorable weather.
    Despite the 4th qtr results, Rhodes said, "net income for
the year just ended should come close to the record level of

(General Partners), a Texas general
partnership equally owned by affiliates of Wagner and Brown and
AFG Industries Inc <AFG>, said it currently holds 2,180,608
common shares, or about 9.8 pct, of Gencorp Inc's <GY>
outstanding common stock.
    General Partners said it began a 100 dlrs a share cash
tender offer for all of Gencorp, an Akron, Ohio-based concern,
that is worth nearly 2.3 billion dlrs.
    Gencorp, which has interests in tire- and plastic-making,
aerospace and broadcasting, has about 22.3 mln shares
outstanding.
    The General Partners offer is subject to receipt of
financing, a majority of Gencorp shares and other conditions.
    In a letter to Gencorp chairman and chief executive A.
William Reynolds describing the offer, General Partners said it
was willing to negotiate terms of the offer and was prepared to
meet as soon as possible.
    In a statement, General Partners said it has contributed
250 mln dlrs in equity financing and also has commitments for 
a one billion dlr credit line from Wells Fargo and Co <WFC> and
a 1.25 billion loan from Shearson Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc,
a unit of American Express Co <AXP>.
    A Gencorp spokesman said the company's management was
meeting but that its board was not scheduled to meet today. He
said he was not sure the company had formally received notice
of the offer but was aware of it through press accounts.
    He declined to say what Gencorp's next move might be or
whether it would issue a statement later today.
    In the letter, General Partners said it plans to maintain
Gencorp's corporate headquarters in Akron, and retain the
company's plastics and industrial products businesses and its
tires and related products segment.
    The letter did not mention Gencorp's RKO General
broadcasting subsidiary, which has been involved in disputes
over license renewals at several of its television stations.
Gencorp has agreed to sell two of its independent stations, WOR
in the New York area and KHJ in Los Angeles.
    General Partners officials were not immediately available.
    Gencorp shares were delayed at the opening on the New York
Stock Exchange because of an imbalance of orders, and the NYSE
said the shares were indicated to open at 103 to 115. The
shares closed up two yesterday at 90-1/2, a new 52-week high.
    The financing for the offer includes the 250 mln dlrs in
equity from General Partners, the 1.25 billion dlr loan from
Shearson Lehman Brothers, a senior subordinated bridge loan for
which a binding agreement can be delivered within 24 hours
after a request from the partnership, and the one billion dlr
credit line from Wells Fargo.
    Wells Fargo has agreed to lend up to 250 mln dlrs of the
line itself and form a syndicate of banks to provide the rest,
the partnership said.
    Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc will act as dealer manager in
the tender offer, it said.
    In the letter, the partnership said it was confident it
could obtain the financing and close the transaction promptly.
    Last fall AFG and privately held Wagner and Brown offered
to acquired (Lear Siegler Inc) for about 1.44 billion dlrs but
withdrew the offer when higher bids emerged. Lear Siegler
eventually went private for about 1.66 billion dlrs.

<Morgan Grenfell Group Plc> said its
1986 pre-tax profits were lower than forecast because of
depreciation in the value of its Guinness Plc <GUIN.L> shares
and because of securities trading losses in the U.S.
    Morgan chairman Lord Catto said the losses on the group's
seven mln Guinness shares in addition to a 3.5 mln dlr loss on
its risk arbitrage operation in New York depressed profits some
eight mln stg to 82.2 mln.
    He also told a news conference Morgan had received informal
approaches about a takeover of the group but was not
interested. No formal offers had been made, but Catto would not
elaborate.
    Morgan Grenfell acted as merchant banker to Guinness during
the brewing company's successful bid for Distillers Co Plc
<DIST.L> in the first half of last year.
    The U.K. Government launched an investigation into the
affairs of Guinness last December. Public concern has focused
on the way Guinness may have breached U.K. Company law and the
Takeover Code by prompting others to support its share price
during the bid.
    Morgan chief executive Christopher Reeves, head of
corporate finance Graham Walsh and senior corporate finance
director Roger Seelig all resigned in January over the Guinness
affair.
    Another senior Morgan Grenfell executive, Geoffrey Collier,
resigned late last year on allegations of trading on insider
information. He currently faces criminal charges.
    Lord Catto said the second half of 1986 had been "one of the
most traumatic in our history," but that clients and staff had
been supportive.
    "I certainly look on the future in a positive way. We have
the worst behind us and have swept nothing under the carpet."
    Profits for the year, up 19.4 pct from 1985 pre-tax profits
of 68.8 mln stg, were mainly due to a high contribution from
corporate finance activities and progress in asset management.
    Finance Director David Ewart told the news conference the
performance of the group so far in 1987 was "within reasonable
touch of the budget."
    Lord Catto also said the group was actively seeking a new
chief executive to replace Sir Peter Carey, who is acting as
interim director after Reeves' resignation, and hopes to have a
new chief executive within a few months.
    He also said Reeves and Walsh had been paid a total of
562,000 stg in compensation following their resignations, but
declined to say how much each man got. Negotiations were going
on to determine an amount of compensation for Seelig, he said.
    Morgan Grenfell shares stood at a late 366p, 9p down on
yesterday's 375p.

The Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) staff is seeking authority to take enforcement
action against Allegheny International Inc, the
Pittsburgh-based industrial and consumer products firm said.
    Allegheny made the disclosure in documents filed with the
SEC in connection with its recent agreement to be taken private
through a leveraged buyout led by First Boston Inc.
    "Following announcement of the merger agreement, the company
was informed by the Enforcement Division of the (SEC) that it
intends to seek authority from the commission to institute a
proceeding against the company," Allegheny said.
    "The company is cooperating in the commission's
investigation which is continuing and now includes the taking
of testimony of employes and others," Allegheny said.
    In the ongoing probe, Allegheny said, the staff has asked
for information about company executive compensation and
benefit plans, certain company-owned real estate, travel and
entertainment spending and the use of corporate aircraft.
    It also has asked for information on acquisitions and
divestitures, the company's accounting system "and other
internal controls," Allegheny said.
   The probe began in February 1986, Allegheny said.
    The SEC, as a matter of policy, routinely declines comment
on its enforcement actions.
    The SEC investigation began just months before Allegheny
became the target of a series of shareholder lawsuits claiming
that the company had violated the federal securities laws by
failing to disclose material matters in recent annual proxy
statements.
    The suits, later consolidated into a single class-action
complaint before a Pennsylvania federal court, allege
securities law violations involving numerous current and former
Allegheny officers and directors.
    Earlier this month, lawyers for the shareholders asked the
court to expand the charges to include an allegation that, in
the buyout, Allegheny had attempted to illegally freeze out its
public shareholders at an unfair price.
    Allegheny said it intends to vigorously defend itself
against all charges.
    The charges made in the shareholder suits are widely
believed to have led to last summer's resignation of Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer Robert Buckley.
    In the buyout, a group led by First Boston tendered March
13 for all outstanding Allegheny shares at 24.60 dlrs a share.

Audi AG <NSUG.F>, the 99 pct owned
subsidiary of Volkswagen AG <VOWG.F>, said profit in 1986 fell
by around half compared with 1985, when it achieved a record
221 mln marks net profit, a rise of 19.5 pct on the previous
year.
    Managing board chairman Wolfgang Habbel told a news
conference he expected both profit and turnover to rise this
year compared with 1986, but he said it was questionable
whether 1987 profit would return to 1985 levels.
    He gave no figure for 1986 profit. Audi had predicted last
year that 1986 profit would likely fall by an unspecified
amount from 1985's record levels.
    Habbel said turnover in 1986 rose to 9.9 billion marks from
9.6 billion in 1985 and looked certain to rise to over 10
billion this year.
    Asked whether Audi would pay a dividend to VW to help the
parent company overcome its currency losses, Habbel said Audi
would ensure VW got a share of profits.
    Audi's entire 1985 net profit was paid into its own free
reserves to help finance investment. In the previous 10 years
VW had received 80 pct of Audi's earnings as a dividend.
    Habbel blamed the profit decline on disruptions to output
caused by the introduction of the new Audi 80 model, on
currency factors and on negative publicity in the U.S. About
alleged "sudden acceleration" of some of its Audi 5000 models.
    As reported, Audi's sales in the U.S. Dropped nearly 20 pct
to 59,800 last year.
    Habbel said the U.S. Sales decline would probably bottom
out in 1987.
    Audi's worldwide car deliveries fell two pct to 363,000.
    Of the total, exports fell 10.5 pct to a rounded 210,000,
but domestic sales increased to a rounded 154,000 from 137,180
in 1985.
    Habbel said the new Audi 80 had sold extremely well in the
first two months of 1987, helping Audi to increase its overall
market share in West Germany to 8.4 pct from 5.2 pct in the
same months of 1986. Sales in Europe also rose but U.S. Sales
fell further, he said without giving details. Worldwide
deliveries in the first two months increased eight pct to
57,000.
    Audi said in January that 1987 car production would rise to
over 400,000 from 384,000 in 1986, when output had fallen
compared with 1985's 392,000.
    Habbel said Audi expected the rise in output to lead to
further new hiring of employees.
    At the end of 1986 Audi's workforce stood at a record
39,800, a rise of 3,400 over 1985.

Most of the cattle now being placed on
U.S. feedlots weigh less than normal and likely will remain on
feed longer, spreading out marketings and supporting cattle
prices through the summer because of reduced beef supply.
    The prospect of so many cattle remaining on feed for a
longer time blunted the market impact of the high placements
reported in the USDA's latest cattle on feed report, livestock
analysts said.
    After the USDA released its report of cattle on feed in
seven states as of March 1, cattle futures on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange yesterday rose sharply. The trade had
expected deferred contracts to decline on the USDA report of a
15 pct rise in cattle placements in February from a year ago.
    Although the heavy placements were expected, analysts noted
reports that many cattle put on feed were relatively
lightweight and said feedlot operators would feed the lighter
cattle into the autumn, rather than market them during the
summer as would be the case with the heavier cattle normally
placed on feed.
    Although reports of actual cattle weights are difficult to
obtain, industry sources in the West and Southwest acknowledge
that lighter cattle are being put on feedlots in their areas.
    The increase in lighter-weight cattle entering feedlots,
helps explain the jump in feedlot placements last month from
February, 1986.
    University of Missouri Agricultural Economist Glenn Grimes
said, "The probabilities are high that in order to place that
many cattle on feed they (feedlot operators) had to go to
lighter-weight cattle.
    The only statistics available are from some terminal
markets which represent only a small percentage of the total
cattle marketed. But at those markets, steers averaged 708 lbs
in February compared with 718 lbs last year, Grimes said.
    Even if marketing of the lighter cattle is not delayed,
Grimes said, beef supply likely will be reduced.
    If the average weight is down, and there is no price
weakness to delay marketings, the cattle would be marketed at
lighter weights, which could reduce the beef supply as much as
three pct.
    Bruce Ginn, cattle analyst for The Helming Group (formerly
LBAS), said the lighter cattle are being placed on feed mainly
because of two factors: low grain prices and higher live cattle
prices.
    Many farmers like to feed lighter weight cattle and grain
supplies are large, he noted. Also, the higher live cattle
prices have been encouraging early movement of cattle from
wheat pasture onto feedlots, Ginn said.
    Other analysts also noted that cattle are coming off wheat
pasture sooner than normal because of poor pasture conditions.
    Gary Chapmann, a cash livestock trader for Chapmann and
Graham in Sioux City, Iowa said he believed the general trend
is to lighter weight placements but pasture conditions in his
area benefited from a dry, mild winter.
    To the south, however, he said the weather was wetter and
some cattle are coming off pasture weighing 75 to 100 lbs less
than normal after having gained only 75 lbs all winter.

New York cocoa traders reacted with
caution to today's developments at the International Cocoa
Organization talks in London, saying there is still time for
negotiations to break down.
    "I would be extremely cautious to go either long or short
at this point," said Jack Ward, president of the cocoa trading
firm Barretto Peat. "If and when a final position comes out (of
the ICCO talks) one will still have time to put on positions.
The risk at the moment is not commensurate with the possible
gain."
    ICCO producer and consumer delegates this morning accepted
the outlines of a compromise proposal on buffer stock rules as
a basis for further negotiation. A smaller group of
representatives is now charged with fleshing out the details.
    "Market sentiment has reflected optimism, I would't put it
any stronger than that," Ward said.
    "It seems to put them slightly closer to an agreement...
but one shouldn't forget how much they have to negotiate," said
another trader of today's developments.
    Many dealers were sidelined coming into the negotiations
and have remained so, traders said.
    "The dealers have got historically small positions in
outright terms," one trader said.

Today's modest half-point cut in U.K.
Bank base lending rates to 10 pct signals the Bank of England's
determination to maintain a cautious monetary stance, but
financial markets appear set to force its hand, analysts said.
    They said a further half-point cut in base rates to 9-1/2
pct was bound to occur within the next week and rates may shed
a further half point soon if markets remain buoyant.
    Earlier, markets were bracing for a one-point cut in rates
after yesterday's budget set a sharp three billion stg
reduction in 1987 government borrowing targets to four billion
stg.
    Sterling money market rates moved lower again, with the key
three-month interbank rate down to 9-5/8 1/2 pct at the start
of business from 9-11/16 9/16 yesterday, and sterling rallied
to four-year highs against the dollar in very active trading.
    Government bond prices also surged on the budget, with
gains in excess of one point pushing yields on long-term paper
below nine pct for the first time in nearly a year.
    But today's smaller than expected rate cut appeared to have
placated markets for now, analysts said. Money market rates
recovered up to 1/4 point from earlier lows while both sterling
and gilts came off highs as trading ground to a near halt.
    Analysts said the slowdown was likely to be temporary, and
the reappraisal of sterling assets by international investors
was set to resume as early as tomorrow, leading to higher gilt
prices, exchange rate advances and lower money market rates.
    "Today's cut was slightly disappointing," said Bill Martin,
chief U.K. Economist at stockbrokers Phillips and Drew. "The
Bank of England is taking a very cautious line ... To temper
the markets' first rush of blood to the head after the budget."
    Analysts said the bank's move today to lend two-week cash
to U.K. Discount houses at a lower 10 pct suggested it hoped to
maintain the new rates for about that period of time.
    The analysts agreed success would depend largely on how
sterling performs in the near term.
    Sharp rises in the pound's value could be checked initially
through Bank of England intervention but eventually the gains
would force the bank to cut interest rates rates again.
    "The market seems to have accepted the modest cut for the
time being," said Midland Bank treasury economist David
Simmonds. "But I am sceptical that the bank will be able to hold
up rates for long."
    Simmonds said he saw sterling rising another two U.S. Cents
this week from around 1.60 dlrs, forcing a rate cut by Friday.
    Robin Marshall, chief economist at Chase Manhattan
Securities, said "There is another half point to come in the
near term, this week or next week at the latest...We see a
whole point off base rates in the next two or three weeks."
    Analysts stressed that apart from prestige, Britain had
very little to gain from a sharp rise in sterling's exchange
rate.
    Martin, of Phillips and Drew, said the dampening effect of
a sterling rise on consumer price inflation would not
materialise for at least nine months while its hampering impact
on manufactured exports would show almost immediately.
    Analysts said the budget, featuring income tax cuts as well
as cautious plans for public finances, had improved the chances
of re-election for the Conservative government and probably
advanced the election date. One must be held before June, 1988.
Combined with overall good prospects for the U.K. Economy, this
was likely to fuel a foreign rush on sterling-denominated
assets, pushing the pound's value well above unofficial
targets.
    With mark-denominated investments largely out of favour
because of low yields and a dull economic outlook, Chase's
Marshall said "Sterling is simply the best game in town,
especially after the budget, and demand will remain strong."

    A company spokesman said the company will file an

requesting the FDA to allow testing of the vaccine in humans.
    Scientists at the company's Genetic Systems unit created an
AIDS vaccine, which Bristol-Myers said produced antibodies to
the AIDS virus in mice and monkeys. The vaccine consists of
smallpox virus remodeled to carry a key gene found on the AIDS
virus.
    Drug industry analysts said that that before the FDA would
allow the vaccine to be tested, a number of safety issues would
have to be resolved. Bristol-Myers said that by piggy-backing
two AIDS virus proteins with the small pox virus, a hybrid
virus is created that simulataneously immunizes against
smallpox and the AIDS virus proteins.
    The vaccine uses two proteins found on the surface of the
AIDS virus. The AIDS virus contains a number of such proteins
and it is not yet known which ones would provoke immunity
against AIDS.

World stocks of silver are large
enough to accommodate any changes in the supply-demand equation
this year, with industrial consumption expected to again exceed
mine production, the dealer house Handy and Harman said in its
annual review of the silver market.
    The house estimated that the industry last year withdrew
20,000,000 ounces of silver from stocks to bridge a supply
deficit caused by a consumption rate of 403,000,000 ounces and
production level of 382,000,000 ounces.
    However, world stocks are huge, totaling 2,267,900,000
ounces at the end of 1986, it said.
    The review noted that world industrial consumption has been
on an uptrend since 1980, although offtake is still 14 pct
below the 1978 level of 442,000,000 ounces.
    Handy and Harman said 22,800,000 ounces of silver were used
to produce coins last year, up from 12,700,000 ounces in 1985,
with the demand getting a big boost from the production of U.S.
coins, including the American Eagle.
    It also said that in recent years Communist countries have
increased their silver imports and estimated that China and
East Germany alone took in 70,000,000 ounces of foreign silver
in the last five years.

The Tax Reform Act of 1986 will have a
substantial impact on Continental Illinois Corp, the company's
annual report says.
    One provision repeals the reserve method of providing for
bad debts for banks with over 500 mln dlrs in assets and
requires that tax loan loss reserves taken in the past, be
restored to current earnings status, it said.
    As a result, those amounts will be subject to federal
taxes, it said. No amounts were disclosed.
    Continental said it decided to deal with this change "in
its entirety" in 1987.
    Tax reform will also change foreign tax credit limitation
rules, and although the impact will not be material in the
short term, the Act will require, for the first time, that
income from certain foreign subsidiaries be taxable, the report
said.
    The new legislation also reduces existing tax credits by
17.5 pct in 1987 and 35 pct in 1988 and later years, it said.
    Continental's investment tax credits carryforwards of 12.8
mln dlrs at 1986 year end will be reduced to 10.6 mln dlrs in
1987 and, if not used in 1987, to 8.3 mln dlrs in 1988, it
said.
    Another provision of the Act could result in limiting the
use of tax credits if a change in ownership of Continental
takes place, the report said.
    This could happen if the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp
sells enough shares of Continental's common stock over the next
two years to cause a change in ownership, it noted.
    In December, the FDIC sold about one-third of its junior
convertible preference stock in Continental to the public in
the form of common stock.

The DIW economic research institute
said West German economic growth in 1987 is unlikely to reach
the 1.5 pct rate it had forecast earlier this year.
    The institute, whose forecasts are more pessimistic than
those of the other four leading German institutes, said the
economy had passed its peak in the summer of 1986, and its
prospects had dimmed significantly since the autumn.
    The DIW repeated earlier predictions that gross national
product (GNP) in the first quarter of 1987 would contract in
real, seasonally adjusted terms against the weak final quarter
of last year. 
    The DIW said that even if the economy recovers in the
remaining three quarters, it was unlikely that demand and
production would rise strongly enough to bring GNP growth up to
1.5 pct.
    Other institutes and economists have recently revised their
forecasts for German 1987 growth to around two pct.
    In a report DIW disputed arguments by other economists that
the economy was showing mixed development, with domestic demand
healthy but foreign demand weak.
    DIW said the crucial split was between weak demand for
capital goods, and strong demand for buildings and consumer
goods, not between foreign and domestic demand.
    It noted that domestic demand for capital goods had been
hit in recent months by the weakness of exports, which had
caused West German firms to scale back investment plans.
    Service industries, unlike manufacturing industry, were
continuing to do well because they relied on consumer demand,
it said.
    In a separate report the HWWA economic research institute
in Hamburg said West Germany's real trade surplus would fall
markedly this year.
    However, the nominal trade surplus would show little change
from 1986's record 112.2 billion marks because of a further
improvement in the terms of trade on average in 1987 compared
with 1986, it said.

The government announced a three billion
franc program to combat long-term unemployment amid speculation
among political and economic analysts that it is positioning
itself for a period of economic reflation.
    The package presented to the cabinet of Prime Minister
Jacques Chirac by Social Affairs and Labour Minister Philippe
Seguin today is to be financed out of a 7.5 billion franc
contingency fund announced on February 25.
    Finance Minister Edouard Balladur previously ruled out a
reflationary program.
    Long-term unemployment, defined as being out of work for
more than one year, affects about 830,000 people or one third
of French unemployed, government figures show.
    The main measures of the employment program give employers
financial incentives to offer short-term work contracts of at
least two years and stress retraining to help the long-term
unemployed return to the labour market.
    Training subsidies and exemptions from social security
contributions are the main incentives for employers.
    "Companies tell us that we have to give them a strong
incentive to take on people who have fallen out of the labour
market and that's why the proposals...Are costly," an aide to
Seguin said.
    The analysts said speculation the government is considering
a reflationary program was sparked by Chirac spokesman Denis
Baudouin, who said yesterday that ministers were generally
agreed on the desirability of relaunching the economy.
    He appeared to contradict statements by Balladur ruling out
economic stimulation despite the government's revision of its
1987 growth forecast to about 2.0 pct from 2.8.
    Finance ministry officials later clarified Baudouin's
remarks, saying there was no question of any move to stimulate
the economy through a boost to consumer spending although
government policy allowed for increased industrial investment
from the proceeds of France's five-year privatisation plan.
    The 1987 budget allowed for 30 billion francs in revenue
from privatisation, to be split between repaying national debt
and providing state enterprises with fresh capital.
    Some political analysts said Baudouin's comments possibly
reflect widening differences within the RPR-UDF coalition on
social issues ahead of next year's presidential elections.
     Divisions began to show last December, when a wave of
strikes led by transport workers paralysed the country and
drove the government into a new mood of conciliation with
labour.
     Officials said that after the success of the privatisation
of Cie de Saint Gobain <SGEP.PA> and Cie Financiere de Paribas
<PARI.PA> the government had decided to speed up its five-year
privatisation program with the aim of completing a third of it
this year, ahead of the presidential elections expected in
1988.
    The accelerated program could provide additional unbudgeted
revenue to boost industrial and research investment and
spending on infrastructure such as the national motorway
network.
   The government also today revived a proposal, blocked last
year by Socialist president Francois Mitterrand, to encourage
more flexible working hours, which it says will boost jobs by
improving the competitiveness of French industry.
    The proposals allowing night-shift work by women and
variations in the standard 39-hour working week are to be put
to parliament as a self-contained draft bill after being vetoed
for procedural reasons by Mitterrand and later the Council of
State.

Prendergast said ATT expects to finance the redemption with
cash.
    "The redemption is part of our continuing efforts to reduce
ATT's financial risk," Predergast said. "In 1986 we reduced our
outstanding debt and preferred stock by a total of 1.6 billion
dlrs. As a result our annual fixed charges were reduced by
almost 200 mln dlrs and our ability to service our existing
debt was strengthened."
    The May one preferred stock redemption will save about 50
mln dlrs in dividends annually and will bring ATT's total debt
and preferred stock reduction to more than 2.5 billion dlrs
since the beginning of 1986, Predergast said.
    ATT said it is required by the issues' terms to redeem
300,000 shares each year as well as providing for the optional
redemption of additional shares.
    The company said it will redeem 600,000 shares of the 3.64
dlrs preferred issue for 50 dlrs per share and 7.3 mln shares
of the issue for 50 dlrs per share plus a premium of 2.18 dlrs
per share.
    ATT said it will redeem each of the 3.74 dlrs preferred
shares 50 dlrs a share plus a premium of 2.35 dlrs a share.
    After the redemption, 600,000 shares of each issue will
remain outstanding, ATT said.
    ATT said it will select the redeemable shares by lot
according to the issues' terms, adding that the record date for
determining the redeemable shares will be March 26, 1987.
    The company said it will pay the May 1 dividend for all
preferred shares, including those being redeemed, in a normal
way to shareholders of record as of March 31, 1987.
    ATT said no transfer of the shares being called for
redemption will be made after March 26, 1987 and the transfer
books will close for those shares on that date.
    American Transtech Inc, the paying agent for the shares, 
will send notices of the redemption on March 30 to the
preferred shareholders who were selected by lot, ATT said.

Energy Secretary John Herrington
said he will propose tax incentives to increase domestic oil
and natural gas exploration and production to the Reagan
Administration for consideration.
    "These options boost production, while avoiding the huge
costs associated with proposals like an oil import fee,"
Herrington told a House Energy subcommittee hearing. "It is my
intention to submit these proposals to the domestic policy
council and the cabinet for consideration and review."
    He said proposals, including an increase in the oil
depletion allowance and repeal of the windfall profits tax,
should be revenue neutral and promote domestic production at
the least cost to the economy and the taxpayers.
    "The goal of the Administration policies is to increase
domestic production. I would like to shoot for one mln barrels
a year."
    The proposals were based on a DOE study released yesterday
warning the United States was threatened by a growing
dependence on oil imports.
    "We project free world dependence on Persian Gulf oil at 65
pct by 1995," Herrington said.
    He said it was too soon to say what the Administration
policy on oil tax incentives would be and indicated there would
be opposition to tax changes.
    "Of course, to move forward with these kinds of options
would require reopening tax issues settled last year (in the
tax reform bill) -- an approach which has not, in general, been
favored by the administration. I think what we need is to
debate this within the Administration," he said.
    He said the proposals might raise gasoline prices.
    Herrington did not specifically confirm a report in today's
Washington Post that he had written to President Reagan urging
an increase in the oil depletion allowance.
    Asked about the report by subcommittee members, Herrington
said various proposals were under consideration and would be
debated within the Administration to determine which would have
the most benefits at the least cost.

earnings for 1987 are likely to be lower than those for 1986

construction area."  The company said it will remain profitable
in 1987 and results should strengthen as the year progresses.

The drastic cutbacks in U.S. drilling
last year are rapidly deflating the United State's natural gas
bubble, which could bring spot shortages in gas supplies next
winter and a modest recovery in the oilpatch, industry analysts
said.
    Faltering deliverability of natural gas, a commodity that
is difficult and costly to import in large quantities, could
more than double the current U.S. rig count to near 2,000 by
1990, some analysts said.
    The need to lock in future supplies of gas for utilities
and big industrial customers may also bring a resurgence of
activity in the Gulf of Mexico's offshore waters where some of
the nation's largest gas reserves are located.
    "We think an upturn in U.S. drilling is imminent," said
James Crandall, an analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc. "Many
companies appear to be switching from oil to gas drilling
because they're betting that the gas market will be back in
balance in a year or two."
    The prospect of diminishing gas supplies is welcome news
for drilling and oilfield service companies that barely
survived last year's plunge in oil prices from about 30 dlrs a
barrel to less than half that. Today's relatively stable oil
prices of about 18 dlrs a barrel are not enough to spur a
return to the heady days of 1981 when the U.S. drilling rig
count soared to a record high of more than 4,500 and oilfield
roustabouts commanded premium wages.
    The latest weekly Hughes Tool Co <HT> rig count, a
barometer of the oil industry's health, showed 761 U.S. rigs
active in what is traditionally the slowest time of the year.
    In 1986, the Hughes rig count began the year at 1,915 but
dived to a post-World War II low of 663 in July as world oil
prices experienced the sharpest decline in recent times.
    Ike Kerridge, a Hughes economist, said "In 1986, the United
States replaced only about 40 pct of the gas it used and that
replacement rate won't be any better this year."
    He added, "We don't have the options we do with oil.
Imports of gas from Canada are limited by pipeline capacity and
importing liquefied natural gas on ships will not be feasible
in the next 10 years because of the cost."
    Only about 6 trillion cubic feet of additional gas reserves
were discovered last year while U.S. consumption approached 16
trillion cubic feet, according to industry estimates.
    George Gaspar, an oil analyst with Robert W. Baird and Co
agreed that the need for gas supplies would set the stage for a
new cycle of gradual increases in U.S. drilling.
    "We anticipate that natural gas pipelines will need to
dedicate to their systems new gas reserves for 1989 and 1990
supplies. That means new drilling programs must begin no later
than mid-1988," Gaspar said.
    Gasper said he sees a new drilling cycle emerging that
could last until 1992 and that he expects the average rig count
to peak near 2,000 in December of 1989.
    Much of the search for new gas reserves is likely to be
conducted in the offshore waters of the Gulf of Mexico, where
federal leases on unexplored areas will revert back to the
government unless drilling begins in the next two or three
years. Some of the industry's biggest companies, such as Exxon
Corp <XON>, Mobil Corp MOB, and Union Texas Petroleum have
already indicated plans to increase spending for drilling later
this year in the Gulf of Mexico, Crandall said.
    For example, Conoco Inc, a Dupont <DD> subsidiary, will
spend 400 mln dlrs to build the Gulf of Mexico's deepest
production platform, which will produce 50 mln cubic feet of
gas per day.
    But T. Boone Pickens, who has acquired huge Texas and
Kansas gas reserves for his Mesa Limited Partnership <MLP> in
recent months, is not convinced that the drilling industry is
on the verge of a recovery.
    Pickens predicts the U.S. rig count will soon drop below
600 and will not increase significantly until oil prices do.
    "The rigs won't go back to work until the price of oil gets
above 30 dlrs a barrel," said Pickens, 58, adding he did not
expect to see the rig count top 2,000 again in his lifetime.
    Tenneco Inc <TGT>, one of the largest U.S. gas producers,
is skeptical that a need for additional gas drilling exists.
    Tenneco vice president Joe Foster said he did not expect
significant increases in drilling for gas until the early 1990s
when the U.S. gas reserves life will have declined to about
seven years' supply. Current spot market prices of about 1.50
dlrs per thousand cubic feet will need to rise to about three
dlrs to spur reserve replacement, he said.

The surprise 2.2 billion-dlr tender
offer for Ohio-based conglomerate GenCorp Inc will not be
enough to buy the company, analysts said.
    Analysts estimated the 100 dlr-per-share offer from General
Partners is 10 to 20 dlrs per share below the breakup value of
GenCorp. However, market sources and analysts said  uncertainty
surrounds any transaction because of the legal challenges to
Gencorp broadcasting licenses.
    Gencorp's stock rose 15-3/4 to 106-1/4 in heavy trading.
    "The expectation is either there will be someone else or
the bidder will sweeten the offer hoping to get management's
cooperation," said Larry Baker, an analyst with E.F. Hutton
group.
    Analysts said there is concern about challenges to
Gencorp's broadcast licenses for two television and 12 radio
stations. Some of the disputes, dating back about 20 years,
were brought by groups that alleged improper foreign payments
and political contributions.
    "I think it kind of muddies an already muddy situation,"
said Baker of the offer.
    Some arbitragers said they were concerned the ongoing issue
might be a stumbling block or result in a long period of time
for any transaction.
    A source close to General Partners, however, said General
Partners would apply to the Federal Communications Commission
for special temporary authority to hold the broadcast stations.
The source said if approved, the authority would allow a
transaction to be carried out.
    If it received the "short-form" approval, General Partners
would set up a trust which would hold the broadcasting
properties until the licensing situation is resolved.
    General Partners is equally owned by investors Wagner and
Brown and glass-maker AFG Industries Inc.
    Some market sources speculated an outside buyer, such as
General Partners, might even be be a catalyst to resolution of
the challenges since it would carry out GenCorp's plan to sell
the stations.
    GenCorp earlier this month reached an agreement with Walt
Disney Co to sell its Los Angeles television station, WHJ-TV.
Disney would pay 217 mln dlrs to GenCorp and 103 mln dlrs to a
group that challenged the station's license.
    GenCorp also has a pending agreement to sell WOR-TV in
Secaucus, N.J. to MCA Inc for 387 mln dlrs.
    General Partners said it intends to keep the company's
plastics and industrial products businesses and its tires and
related products segment.
    Charles Rose, an analyst with Oppenheimer and Co, said
that, on a breakup valuation, the company might be worth as
much as 125 dlrs per share. Rose estimated the aerospace
business could bring 30 to 40 dlrs per share or one billion
dlrs, as would DiversiTech, the plastics unit. Broadcasting,
including assets pending sale, might be 30 to 40 dlrs per
share, he said.
    The company, formerly known as General Tire
and Rubber Co, also has a tire business Rose estimated would be
worth five to 10 dlrs per share. He estimated the bottling
business might also be worth several dollars per share, he
said.
    Analysts said GenCorp chairman A. William Reynolds, who
became chairman last year, has been emphasizing the company's
Aerojet General and DiversiTech General businesses. GenCorp,
founded in 1915, became an unfocused conglomerate over the
years and analysts believe reynolds has helped it to improve.
    "The management's doing a very fine job in trying to deal
with the non-strategic assets of the company," Rose said.
    Analysts expect GenCorp to resist the tender offer, but
they declined to predict what steps the company might take.
They said it would be possible the company might consider a
leveraged buyout or restructuring to fend off the offer.
    General Partners holds 9.8 pct of GenCorp stock, and there
was some concern about "greenmail." Greenmail is the payment at
a premium for an unwanted shareholders' stock.
    "I would doubt they would greenmail them, but nothing
surprises me anymore," said Rose.
    GenCorp has not commented on the offer. It has retained
First Boston Corp and Kidder, Peabody and Co as advisers.

Fleet Financial Group said
that its board and the board of Norstar Bancorp have agreed to
merge the two bank holding companies in a transaction which
would create a 23 billion dlr asset bank holding company.
    Under terms of the transaction, each Norstar shareholder
will receive 1.2 shares of Fleet common stock based on the
number of Fleet shares after giving effect to a previously
announced April one Fleet stock split.
     The two-for-one stock split will increase Fleet's
currently 25.7 mln outstanding shares to 51.5 shares. There are
about 34.9 mln Norstar shares outstanding.
    Fleet said the deal is expected to be completed by July one
1988, the date on which the nationalization of Rhode Island's
interstate banking law takes effect.
    For the full year ended december 31, Fleet, a Rhode Island
based bank holding company, reported net income of 136.7 mln
dlrs and assets of 11.7 billion dlrs. Norstar, an Albany N.y.
holding company, reported net income of 104.8 mln dlrs and
assets of 11.1 billion dlrs.
     Fleet comptroller Irv Goss said it is estimated that the
transaction will result in minimal dilution in Fleet/Norstar
earnings per share. It is the intention of both companies that
cash quarterly dividends following the combination not decline
for either company's stock holders, the company said.
    For 1986, Norstar issued 1.31 dlrs annually in cash
dividends on its common stock. Fleet's current annual
distibution on a pre-split basis would be equivalent to 1.68
dlrs a share.
    In addition, Fleet and Norstar have each granted the other
an option to purchase such number of authorized buy unissued
shares of common stock, that will constitute 24.99 pct of the
fully diluted shares outstanding.
    The transaction is subject to both regulatory and
shareholder approval.
    The companies said that after the proposed merger, the
combined banking holding wil be among the 25 largest in the
country.

and I am hopeful that it does, the public market is one of the

in the form of a management buyout and not a leveraged buyout.

debt issue or conventional financing from investors.

just selling off assets."

The 1988 agriculture budget will
have to be cut by an additional one to two billion dlrs, the
chairman of a key house agriculture subcommittee said.
    Implementation of a 0/92 program, a tightening up of the
use of commodity certificates, and reconstitution of farms are
possibilities that will be studied to reduce farm spending,
said Dan Glickman, D-Kans., chairman of the House agriculture
subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feedgrains.
    Speaking at the annual meeting of the National Grain and
Feed Association, Glickman said he learned this week from the
House budget committee that the agriculture committee will have
to reduce the fiscal year 1988 farm budget by up to two billion
dlrs from the 30 billion dlrs level already approved.
    Decisions on how to cut the farm budget will have to be
made very quickly in order to make any impact on the FY 1988
budget, Glickman added.
    Glickman also said his committee will not approve USDA's 
proposal to cut target prices by ten pct per year.
    "The administration's target price proposals are dead in
the water," he said.
    To cut the budget, Glickman said, "everthing is on the
table," except those moves that would reduce farmers' income.
    Glickman offered a list of possibilities that his committee
will study in order to cut farm spending.
    Implementation of a 0/92 program for 1987 winter wheat and
1988 feedgrains crops has been introduced by Glickman, which he
said would result in a 150-200 mln dlr savings for one year.
    Tightening up on the use of generic (in-kind, or "pik')
certificates will also be another option his committee will
study, Glickman said.
    While not committing himself for or against such action, he
said lawmakers have to examine recent government findings which
indicate certificates cost more than cash payments.
    Glickman said rules for the reconstitution of farms and
tightening up of the person definition for annual payment
limitations is another option and could save 100-200 mln dlrs.
    He also said increasing acreage set-aside requirements by
five pct for wheat and feedgrains at program sign-up was a move
that could save about one billion dlrs, but added that he would
not be in favor of such a change.
    Glickman also said that the Export Enhancement Program's,
EEP, spending authority of 1.5 billion dlrs is quickly being
used up, and Congress will have to decide whether to expand
this program while making cuts in other areas.
    Cuts in the EEP program are unlikely, he said.
    "I don't see right now that the EEP will be on the chopping
block," Glickman said.

CPC International Inc said it expects
1987 earnings per share to increase over 1986 levels.
    "We are confident that 1987 will top 1986 in earnings per
share and are optimistic about our longer-term future as well,"
the company said in its 1986 annual report.
    In 1986, CPC earned 219.2 mln dlrs, or 2.30 dlrs a share,
on revenues of 4.55 billion dlrs compared with income of 142
mln dlrs or 1.46 dlrs on sales of 4.21 billion dlrs in 1985.
The share figures are adjusted for a 2-for-1 split paid in
January.
    A share buyback program started last year reduced the
number of shares outstanding to 82.6 mln at year-end 1986 from
97.2 mln dlrs the end of 1985, adjusted for the split.
    The food and grocery products company also said it was the
subject of five stockholder lawsuits and one class action suit,
filed last November and December in Delaware, New York and New
Jersey.
    The suits are related to the company's purchase of its
shares from Salomon Brothers Inc after Salomon bought a block
of the stock from Ronald Perelman, who had acquired nearly 3.7
mln CPC shares, or 7.6 pct of the company, last year.
    The suits allege the company bought the shares back at an
artificially inflated price, violating securities laws,
breaching directors' fiduciary duties and wasting corporate
assets.
    CPC said the defendants, which include the company, its
directors, Salomon and Perelman, deny all the allegations of
improper conduct and are defending the suits.

Carolina Power and Light Co said
its board has decided to cancel coal-fired Mayo Unit Two, the
second unit planned for its Mayo Plant in Person County, N.C.
    The company said the 690,000 kilowatt unit was only about
one pct complete and was scheduled for commercial service in
1992.
    Carolina Power said the status of the unit had been under
review because of a decision by the North Carolina
Environmental Management Commission that would have required
the unit to be equipped with expensive sulphur dioxide-removing
scrubbers.
    Carolina Power said Unit One, which has been in operation
since 1983, meets all air quality regulations without scrubbers
through the use of low-sulphur coal, and "The addition of
scrubbers to Mayo Unit Two would have produced only marginal
air quality improvements."
    The company said it will be able to purchase lower-cost
power from Duke Power Co <DUK> for intermediate and peaking
purposes than the projected cost of power from Mayo Two with
scrubbers.  It said it will retain the Mayo Two site for later
development of a generating unit.
    Carolina Power said Mayo Two was projected to cost about
877 mln dlrs, including 200 mln dlrs for scrubbers.  "The
higher construction costs, plus higher operating costs, would
increase the cost of power produced by Mayo Unit Two with
scrubbers by about 90 mln dlrs per year."
    A company spokesman said the company has already spent
about 23 mln dlrs on Mayo Two. He said no estimate has yet been
made of the cost of canceling the plant, but the company does
not expect to take a charge against earnings.  He said Carolina
Power intends to include the cancellation costs in rate filings
it will make late this year or early next year.

New England Electric System <NES>
expects its cash construction spending to reach 205 mln dlrs
this year, up from 188 mln dlrs in 1986, the utility said in
material distributed at an analysts meeting.
    It said spending is expected to advance to 215 mln dlrs in
1988 and 220 mln dlrs in 1989.
    The utility said these totals exclude spending on New
England Hydro-Transmission being built to import electricity
from Quebec Hydro. New England Electric is the operator of this
venture as well as owning 51 pct of the project.
    The venture expects to spend 65 mln dlr this year, 105 mln
dlrs next year and 125 mln dlrs in 1989 to build transmission
lines from northern Quebec into New England, the utility said.
    New England Electric said internally generated funds will
cover all of its power plant construction costs this year and
65 pct of the 108 mln dlrs its retail distribution units plan
to spend in 1987.
    The company said it also expects to spend 60 mln dlrs on
its oil and gas activities this year, adding internally
generated funds are expected to provide 85 pct of this total.
    New England Electric said it plans to issue 30 mln dlrs
worth of pollution control bonds in 1987 and retire additional
higher cost preferred stock. Its Granite State Electric unit
plans to issue five mln dlrs of long term notes early this year
as well.
    The company said it does not plan to offer common shares
this year or in the foreseeable future, but expects to raise
about 40 mln dlrs in equity through the sale of stock under its
dividend reinvestment plan and employee share plans.
    President Samuel Huntington told the analysts the
construction spending projection is based on the expectation
that demand for electricity in the New England electric system
will grow about two pct a year for the next 15 years.
    However, the utility cannot ignore the potential for
sharper growth, he said, pointing out that demand was up 5.2
pct in 1986 and 4.7 pct per year in the past four years.
    He attributed this growth to declining electricity prices
and a strong New England economy.
    Huntington said New England Elecetric has "all but rejected
new coal fired plants" to supply additional power.
    He said the most attractive new power supplies are those
with short lead times which can be built in modules.
    Later, vice president Glenn Schleede said the utility is
looking at gas-fired, combined cycle generating units to supply
most of its new power needs, but has not rejected coal-fired
fluidized bed units.
    He explained that fluidized bed technology is available in
modular units, adding that Huntington was referring to the
traditional coal-fired plant which burns pulverized coal.

Laidlaw Transportation Ltd said
earnings per share for the current fiscal year should increase
by "substantially more" than the 30 pct average annual growth
experienced in the last four years.
    Revenues for the year ended August 31 will be about 1.2
billion dlrs, including GSX Corp, the U.S. waste services unit
acquired from Imasco Ltd last year for 358 mln dlrs, Laidlaw
president Michael de Groote told analysts.
    Last year, Laidlaw had operating earnings of 66.2 mln dlrs,
or 63 cts per share, on revenues of 717.8 mln dlrs.
    De Groote also said the company expects "excellent results"
in the second quarter ended February 28, but would not be more
specific.
    He said his revenue estimate for fiscal 1987 does not
include possible further acquisitions and said that the
addition of GSX will produce increasing benefits in fiscal 1988
through fiscal 1990.
    De Groote said the increased earnings in the previous four
quarters was due partly to internal growth of about 15 pct. The
rest came from acquisitions, he said.
    Laidlaw expects to sell a small rubber recycling operation,
a subsidiary of GSX, within the next few weeks, but this will
not make any material contribution to earnings, de Groote said.
    He also said he is "not very optimistic" about the ongoing
negotiations to buy 50 pct of Tricil Ltd, a Toronto-based
chemical and solid waste services company with Canadian and
U.S. operations, from <Trimac Ltd> of Calgary.
    De Groote said that, regardless of the outcome of the
proposed Tricil acquisition, Laidlaw will decide within the
next 30 days whether to stay in the North American chemical
waste business through GSX Corp.
    "We feel it is a profitable business with good growth
potential and we now want to stay in it if we can get the right
management," de Groote said.
    Laidlaw financed the acquisition of GSX by its U.S.
subsidiary, Laidlaw Transportation Inc, with the proceeds of a
200 mln Canadian dlr preferred stock issue and borrowing.
    De Groote said the company will gain about 138 mln dlrs in
cash by August 31 from the exercise of warrants.
    De Groote also said waste services in fiscal 1987 will
represent about 49 pct of revenues, school buses will
contribute 49 pct and trucking about two pct.
    The trucking subsidiary in western Canada is performing
well and there are no plans to sell it, he said.
    He would not estimate the contribution of each segment to
earnings per share for the year. He also said that further
acquisitions of school bus operations in the U.S. are likely
within the next few months.

    The figures reflected a radical split in the health of
banks in the two halves of the country, the FDIC said.
    In the East, one in 12 banks had losses last year, while
one in four banks west of the Mississippi River had losses.
    Nationwide, one out of five banks reported losses, the FDIC
said in the first of a new series of quarterly banking profiles
it planned to issue.
    "I don't remember a time when there was such a clear
distinction by geographic area," FDIC Chairman William Seidman
told reporters.
    He said that while the figures were not good, they showed
the problem did not lie with the banking system as a whole but
with regional differences in economic performance.
    Some 44 banks have failed so far this year, twice as many
as failed by this time a year ago, but Seidman said he doubted
the pace would continue. 
    On a positive note, banks increased capital to a record 208
billion dlrs last year, and there has been a slowing in the
number of new problem banks in all regions except the
Southwest, Seidman said.
    Banks' provision for losses from bad loans in the fourth
quarter increased to 21.7 billion dlrs, a 23 pct rise from a
year ago.
    Large banks -- those with assets of one billion dlrs or
more -- reporting fourth-quarter losses totaled 22, the FDIC
said.
    Seidman said it was too early to say what effect Brazil's
moratorium on debt interest payments would have on U.S. banks.
    He said bank deregulation had given managers more freedom
to run their banks and that an increase in failures was to be
expected.
    But this freedom from regulatory restraints also has meant
other banks that were better managed have gotten stronger,
Seidman said.

ESSO SAF <ESSF.PA>, the French subsidiary

down one of its two refineries. Exxon's new president Lee R.
Raymond said earlier that it could decide to close a French
refinery.
    An ESSO SAF spokesman said a closure was a hypothesis that
depended on the evolution of the market and refineries' ability
to make money. He said Port Jerome west of Paris and Fos sur
Mer on the Mediterranean had benefitted from new investment
over 1985-86 and had last year broken even after stock losses.
    The Port Jerome refinery has an annual production capacity
of seven mln tonnes while Fos sur Mer's is five mln, the
spokesman added.
    Industry sources said the easiest plant to dispose of would
be Fos sur Mer because it is a single refinery, while the Port
Jerome refinery is attached to a wider complex comprising a
petrochemical plant and a lubricant production plant.
    Raymond was quoted as saying in a published interview that
Exxon was reviewing its worldwide refinery operations and might
decide to close one of its French refineries.

The Interstate Commerce Commission
(ICC), which regulates interstate freight rail service,
concluded that none of the 24 largest U.S. freight railroads
had adequate revenues in 1985.
    The finding is important because it means the ICC is likely
to look favorably on requests for rate increases by these
railroads made during the current year.
    Under federal law, the ICC must give harsher scrutiny to
rate increase requests for railroads with adequate revenues.
    Though freight rates are no longer strictly regulated by
the government, the ICC can still block a newly proposed rate
if it finds it to be unreasonable.
    In past efforts at calculating revenue adequacy, the ICC
has been accused of favoritism by both the railroad industry
and shippers. This year, the ICC used a new approach but two of
five commissioners nonetheless voted against the finding.
    "For the period from 1979 to the present, railroad returns
have fallen well short of their cost of capital, however
defined," commented ICC Chairman Heather Gradison, who voted
with the majority.
    The ICC concluded that the freight railroads with the
highest rates of return on investment were the Chesepeake and
Ohio with an 11.1 pct rate, the Burlington Northern with a 10.3
pct rate, the Kansas City Southern with a 9.2 pct rate, and and
the Norfolk and Western with a 9.1 pc rate.
    Four of the 24 largest railroads--the Boston and Maine, the
Delaware and Hudson, the Elgin, Joliet and Eastern and the
Western Pacific--had operating losses, the ICC found.

GAMCO Investors Inc, an affiliate of

the GenCorp Inc annual meeting March 31, according to GAMCO
Chairman Mario Gabelli.
    Greenmail often involves the repurchase of shares at a
premium by a company from an unwanted investor. GenCorp today
received a surprise tender offer from a group that holds 9.8
pct of its stock.
    Gabelli also said GAMCO has sent a 13-D filing to the
Securities and Exchange Commission on the 6.5 pct of GenCorp
stock held by GAMCO and its affiliates.
    The stock amounts to 1,462,000 shares and most of it was
reported in an earlier 13-G filing. A 13-G is filed by passive
investors to show holdings of more than five pct.
    Earlier today, General Partners, owned by Wagner and Brown
and AFG Industries Inc, launched a 100 dlr per share tender
offer for GenCorp. Analysts said the offer was between 10 and
20 dlrs per share too low.
    GenCorp has made no comment on the offer.
    Gabelli said he also proposes that management consider
spinning off all assets, other than the GenCorp broadcast
properties, to shareholders. The licenses of the broadcast
properties have long been entangled in a series of challenges.
    "One thing is going to be clear and that is I'm going to
the meeting and putting up "no greenmail," Gabelli said.
    Gabelli said he fears that greenmail might be a motivation
in the offer.
    The annual meeting is to be held in Akron, Ohio.

three-day meeting here tomorrow satisfied with the industry's
growth but uncertain about their futures.
    An estimated 1,200 industry officials are expected to
attend the annual gathering hosted by the Futures Industry
Association, FIA.
    The satisfaction comes from the dramatic expansion of the
U.S. futures and options industries over the last decade.
    The uncertainty surrounding this year's meeting stems
largely from a pervasive sense that the potential for major
market disruption stalks the futures, options and equity
industries.
    This bucolic resort will provide an ironic backdrop as the
financial industry's chiefs anxiously observe this quarter's
triple witching hour, March 20, when price gyrations threaten
to rock markets.
    Triple witching occurs when stock index futures and options
and individual stock options expire simultaneously.
    The quarterly phenomenon has been marked by price
volatility as arbitrageurs have shifted investments between
stocks and their derivative instruments.
    In an effort to quell price fluctuations, the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, CME, home of the Standard and Poor's 500
stock index futures contract, recently announced plans to move
the contract's settlement to the morning of the quarterly
expiration day from the afternoon.
    The New York Stock Exchange this Friday intends to
implement stricter procedures requiring members to submit all
market-on-close orders in 50 blue-chip stocks by 1530 EST.
    Despite these efforts to ensure smoother contract
expirations, there is a sense more might have to be done to
avert an uncontrollable fall in prices someday.
    Looming over the exchanges are the twin threats of
fortified federal regulation and congressional action to strap
market activity.
    Commodity Futures Trading Commission, CFTC, Chairman Susan
Phillips has said the current regulatory structure is adequate
to cope with intermarket arbitrage, but that she expects new
surveillance procedures and enhanced cooperation with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC.
    SEC Chairman John Shad, voicing concern over price
volatility associated with program trading, has resurrected a
proposal, opposed by CFTC officials, to give federal regulators
control over the setting of futures margins.
    Some contend that because futures margins are low relative
to stock margins, portfolio managers have a tendency to shift
out of stock index futures in a falling stock market, hastening
a downward price spiral.
    Absent from this week's meeting will be a key congressional
player -- Rep. John Dingell (D-Mi.), chairman of the House
Energy and Commerce Committee and head of a subcommittee
responsible for overseeing the SEC.
    Dingell has promised to look into program trading and
explore ways of insuring investors and hedgers against market
disruptions. He is interested in reviewing margins and dual
trading, a practice that allows futures brokers to trade for
their own account before placing customers' orders.
    Recently, a group of CME members, concerned over the
perception of abuse of dual trading, proposed banning the
practice. The CME board responded with a plan that would
restrict, but not ban, the activity.
    The meeting will also be attended by regulators from
Australia, Britain, France, Hong Kong, New Zealand and
Singapore. Their appearance coincides with a controversial CFTC
proposal to adopt new regulations over the trading of foreign
futures and options on U.S. exchanges.
    The U.S. exchanges oppose the proposed regulations on the
grounds they would prove unnecessarily burdensome.
    Other areas of disagreement between the CFTC and the
exchanges include the requirement that the exchanges implement
strict, one-minute audit trails by this summer, proposals to
revise federal limits on speculative positions and the
definition of hedging, and CFTC efforts to determine which new
instruments must be traded on regulated exchanges.

Representatives of the International
Wrought Copper Council (IWCC) and major copper producers have
told the London Metal Exchange (LME) a clear statement of its
forward strategy would lead to a better understanding between
industry and the LME.
    In a press release the IWCC said that at the latest meeting
between the copper industry and the LME to discuss the new
clearing house system, industry expressed grave concern about
latest proposals made by at least one LME member for a cash
cleared market to replace the planned clearing system which
will retain the prompt date settlement basis.
    Copper industry delegates told the LME a decision to change
(the planned clearing system) would indicate a fundamental
change in the function of the LME and in its service to the
industry, the release said.
    By deterring industry use of the Exchange for hedging and
physical needs it would remove many of the unique advantages
currently offered by the LME and make it indistinguishable from
non-trade orientated markets such as Comex.
    The LME had to decide whether dealer convenience should
take a higher priority over customer satisfaction, industry
delegates said.
    The IWCC release also said the LME had confirmed that no
change would be made to the clearing system planned to start on
May 29. But it had indicated that consideration would be given
in due course to the cash clearing proposal, made by
Amalgamated Metal Trading at a LME members meeting last week.
    A copper industry spokesman suggested that some assurance
of permanence in the new clearing system would remove industry
fears of uncertainty resulting from an endless process of
review and change, the press release said.

The U.S. Congress and the oil industry
are deeply divided on ways the government should assist the
industry, hurt by the sharp fall in oil prices, and the
subsequent growth in oil imports, industry analysts said.
    "The industry is deeply divided between those who support an
oil tariff and those who believe tax incentives are better,"
said Daniel Yergin, director of Cambridge Energy Research
Associates, which recently completed a survey of the U.S.
Congress on energy issues.
    Yergin said he saw mounting support within Congress for tax
incentives rather than an oil tariff or import fee.
    Today U.S. Energy Secretary John Herington said he will
propose tax incentives to increase edomestic oil and natural
gas exploration and production to the Reagan Administration for
consideration. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the
proposal would be reviewed.
    Herrington said, "I would like to shoot for one mln barrels
a day (addition) to U.S. production." U.S. oil output was off to
8.4 mln bpd in the week of March 13, down six pct from last
year, the American Petroleum Institute said.
    Oil industry analysts have forecast oil prices to average
about 18 dlrs a barrel for the year and many believe that a
move above that level will be unlikey for the near term.
    Paul Mlotok, oil analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc said that
"even with the rise in prices for the last week or two we've
only altered our average price scenerio to about 17.50 dlrs for
the year."
    Analysts said that at that price renewed drilling and
exploration to reverse the decline in U.S. crude oil output
will not take place as the companies are waiting for stable
prices over 20 dlrs to renew exploration.
    John Lichtblau, president of the Petroleum Industry
Research Foundation Inc in New york in recent testimony to
Congress said "The continuing decline in U.S. oil production is
virtually inevitable under any realistic price scenario. But
the future rate of decline is very much a function of world oil
prices and U.S. government policy."
    Lichtbalu said that tax breaks could be used to raise oil
production but would only work over time.
    "Lowering the producing industry's tax burden would probably
be a slower stimulant (to output) than a price increase but
would not raise energy costs." Lichtblau said.
    But the small independent oil companies who do much of the
drilling in the U.S. are looking for the more immediate relief
which could be brought on by an oil import fee.
    Ronald Tappmeyer, president of the International
Association of Drilling Contractors, said, "The members of our
trade asssociation are convinced that only a variable oil
import fee that sets a minimum price trigger can protect our
nation." The association represents some 1,300 drilling and oil
service companies.
    The CERA survey of Congress shows that the oil import fee
will face a stiff uphill battle.
    Yergin said that the poll which was conducted in January by
a former Congressman, Orval Hansen, showed support for the oil
import fee from 22 pct of the Congressmen surveyed largely as a
means of protecting the domestic petroleum industry.
     At the same time 48 pct of the Congressmen surveyed
opposed the fee with the respondents saying the tariff would
hurt consumers and some regional interests.
    But 80 pct of the sample said support for a fee could grow
if production continued to fall and imports to rise.
    Yergin said that imports above 50 pct of U.S. requirements
"is a critical, symbolic level. If they (imports) move above
that level, a fee may not be legislated but there will
certainly be pressure for some form of action."
     But Lichtblau, in a telephone interview, said, "a 50 pct
rate of import dependency is not likely to happen before 1990.
    In 1986 U.S. oil imports rose to 33 pct of u.s. energy
requirements and shopuld be about 34 pct in 1987, he added.

does not expect to pay preferred dividends in the forseeable

    It said the payments were suspended because of certain
covenants contained in its loan agreements. A spokesman said
the company's loss of 2,115,000 dlrs for the first 11 months as
a public company did not meet an income condition on the loans,
leading to the suspension.

The Federal Reserve Board has
approved the application of Chase Manhattan Corp to engage in
underwriting and dealing in commercial paper of Chase
Commercial Corp, the lending subsidiary of the parent bank
holding company.
    The Fed order said Chase Manhattan's application was
consistent with sound banking practices and existing laws. But
it added a bill adopted by the Senate Banking Committee last
week could affect Chase Manhattan if it becomes law and might
force it eventually to cease commercial paper underwriting
activities.
     The Fed said the application was similar to that of
Bankers Trust to engage in commercial paper placement that was
approved last December.
    Chase Manhattan Corp, with consolidated assets of 90
billion dlrs, is the second largest banking organization in New
York and operates in the United States and abroad.
    The Fed noted the Securities Industry Association, a trade
association of the investment banking industry, had opposed
Chase Manhattan's application for more powers.
    Chase Manhattan now will be able to underwrite commercial
paper, buying it for resale to institutions like banks.
     In addition, Chase Manhattan will be able to place
commercial paper as agents for issuers and advise them on rates
and maturities of proposed issues just as Bankers Trust was
given authority to do.
    The minimum denomination of commercial paper offered and
purchased would be 250,000 dlrs.
    The Fed said it felt there would be no violation of banking
laws provided that Chase Manhattan restricted its commercial
paper activities to five pct of its income and five pct of
total market share.
    The Fed said dealing in commercial paper was related to
Chase Manhattan's regular banking activities because "this kind
of instrument has many of the characteristics of a traditional
commercial loan."
    "Because of its short term nature, commercial paper is
customarily held to maturity -- like a commercial loan," the Fed
order said.
    Among the benefits for the public will be increased
competition in the commercial paper market and more convenient
service for borrowers and investors, the Fed said.

Financial analysts see little chance
that U.S. interest rate futures will break out of their narrow
ranges and low volatility during the remainder of the week.
    "We got a little volatility Wednesday," said Staley
Commodities International analyst Jerome Lacey. "But for the
moment we're still in a trading range."
    Even unexpected developments concerning the growth of the
U.S. economy may not be enough to spur the market out of its
sluggish state, the analysts said.
    "It (the bond market) has not yet demonstrated that it can
break out of its very low volatility," said Carroll McEntee and
McGinley analyst Denis Karnosky. "It needs something, but it's
not going to be news about the economy," he said.
    Karnosky said that the bond market will possibly break out
of the doldrums if participants perceive that the dollar has
stabilized and the Federal Reserve has more room to conduct
monetary policy.
    But even Wednesday, when fed funds were below six pct, the
dollar strong and oil on the soft side, bond futures attracted
eager sellers when contracts approached recent highs, he said.
    In addition to a changing perception about the dollar and
monetary policy, Golden Gate Futures president Norman Quinn
said the beginning of April could bring foreign investors back
into the marketplace.
    "The market is beginning to feel there may be demand at the
beginning of the fiscal year in Japan on April 1," Quinn said.
    Quinn echoed the sentiment of many analysts that there are
large amounts of cash waiting to be invested. If Japanese
investment in U.S. securities does materialize at the start of
Japan's fiscal year, domestic funds may also flow into the bond
market, he said.
    "We could get a stiff rally, possibly enough to bring
yields on long bonds down to seven to 7-1/8 pct," compared to
the current yield of about 7.5 pct, Quinn said.
    In the meantime, even the prospect of new supply is not
likely to move futures.
    The Treasury's announcement of a 15 billion dlr refunding
operation did little to move cash government securities prices
late Wednesday after the close of futures.
    "I'd be surprised if supply pushed us out of it (the
trading range)," Lacey said.

A key House panel voted to greatly
ease government controls on exports as several House committees
moved rapidly toward approval of major changes in trade laws
they hope will help solve U.S. trade woes.
    The House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on International
Economic Policy voted to direct the administration to cut the
list of controlled exports by 40 per cent by removing items no
longer considered important to U.S. military security.
    Industries had complained they were losing sales to foreign
competitors who were allowed to export freely products U.S.
companies could not sell abroad.
    The issue has been the subject of administration debate.
The Commerce Department had held that unnecessary restrictions
impeded U.S. exports while the Defense Department said current
controls should be retained but better administered.
    Four congressional panels met today to consider portions of
a wideranging trade bill that intends to help U.S. companies
sell more products abroad and to fight unfair foreign trade
practices.
    Their separate proposals, some of them conflicting, will be
woven by House Democratic leaders into a final trade bill for a
vote by the full House in late April.
    Sparked by the proposal of Fujitsu Ltd. to take controlling
interest in Schlumberger Ltd's Fairchild Semiconductor Corp.,
the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on Commerce voted to
expand Reagan's authority to block foreign takeovers of U.S.
companies.
    Reagan would be able to block any takeover found to be
damaging to U.S. economic or national security interests.
    "We are losing our semiconductors which are at the heart of
our national security," subcommittee chairman James Florio, a
New Jersey Democrat said.
    The subcommittee also called for the administration to
consider retaliation against Japan for its restrictive
government procurement practices.
    The retaliation could be triggered by a requirement that
the administration investigate whether U.S. companies were
treated unfairly and whether they have been barred from bids on
lucrative public works projects such as the eight billion dlr
Kansai airport construction. U.S. firms have complained they
were not allowed to bid on its construction.
    At the urging of the U.S. recording industry, the
subcommittee agreed to bar imports of a new Japanese
product--digital audio recorders.
    Meeting in closed session, the House Ways and Means
Committee agreed to allow President Reagan to retaliate against
foreign countries that refuse to open their markets to U.S.
telecommunications products.
     Congressional aides said the committee also agreed U.S.
companies would be allowed to press for relief from imports of
counterfeit products made in violation of U.S. copyright and
patent laws.

General Partners said proceeds from the sale of GenCorp's
aerospace division would help it repay some of the debt it
would incur in the 100 dlr a share cash tender offer.

of the total outstanding common stock.

    But General Partners said it plans to keep GenCorp's
headquarter in Akron, Ohio.
    General Partners also said it would maintain GenCorp's
plastics and industrial products division as well as tires and
related products.
    But it left open that it might make other changes in
GenCorp's operations after it completes the merger.
    Besides using 250 mln dlrs of its own equity for the tender
offer, General Partners said it would seek one billion dlrs
under a secured margin facility from Wells Fargo Bank N.A.
and other banks. It also said it would seek 1.25 billion dlrs
from the sale to Shearson Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc or its
affiliates of senior subordinated promissory notes.
    In a March 18 letter to GenCorp Chairman William Reynolds,
which was included in the SEC filing, General Partners
officials said they were "confident of our ability to promptly
obtain the remaining funding as described in our offer
materials."
    "For this reason, we do not forsee any obstacles to a
prompt consummation of the transaction," General Partners said.
    Shearson is dealer manager of the General Partners offer

Dismantling agricultural subsidies
and implementing international farm policy reform will be the
top priorities of the United States at the upcoming Venice
Economic Summit, Secretary of State George Shultz told a group
of American farm leaders.
    "We want to see the American farmer put in a position in
which he can compete on a level playing field," Shultz told the
board of directors for the National Association of Wheat
Growers.
    The global agricultural situation is in the midst of the
most serious farm crisis in modern history, Shultz said, and
how the U.S. responds to the current problems will determine
whether the U.S. will continue its leadership role in world
agriculture.
    Government policies that subsidize production and exports
have created a "crisis of overproduction," he said. Shultz
particularly criticized European Community policies which he
said encourage domestic production by providing high government
supports to farmers and then exporting the surplus product with
the help of huge subsidies.
    The U.S. and its trading partners cannot afford to continue
current high levels of subsidies, he said. But the U.S. cannot
stop subsidies alone, Shultz said. "We have to agree to
dismantle these systems together," he said.
    The U.S., EC and Japan have the obligation to take the lead
in agricultural reform, he said. For that reason, U.S.
officials will push for farm reform at the Venice meeting and
have made it a top priority for GATT negotiations in Geneva.

The U.S. Departments of Agriculture
and Transportation are close to agreement on how to fund the
increasing share of food aid to be shipped on U.S. flag vessels
under a 1985 farm bill provision on cargo preference.
    Melvin Sims, USDA's general sales manager told a House
Agriculture Appropriations subcommittee hearing that the two
departments are negotiating a "memorandum of understanding" on
cargo preference.
    Under a 1985 farm bill provision, the percentage of food
aid shipments carried on U.S. flag vessels was to gradually
increase over three years to 75 pct in 1988. The increased cost
of using U.S. vessels was to be funded by the Transportation
Department instead of USDA. However, USDA officials said
Transportation has so far contributed no money.
    The agreement between USDA and Transportation is expected
to resolve the matter, USDA officials said.
    Tom Kay, administrator of the USDA's Foreign Agricultural
Service said yesterday the requirement that more food aid
shipments be carried on U.S. vessels has been difficult to
meet.
    "As the tonnage (required under cargo preference) goes up,
its going to be harder and harder to meet," Kay said.
    Two farm state Congressmen, Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) and Glenn
English (D-Okla.) said cargo preference makes U.S. farm export
programs more costly and the program should be eliminated.
    In the past, farm interests opposed to cargo preference
have been defeated in Congress by the maritime interests who
view cargo preference as vital to the U.S. shipping fleet.

in 1985 to open a lobbying firm, faces a maximum penalty of 25
years in prison if convicted. Immediately after the indictment
was announced Reagan issued a statement wishing Deaver well.

corporations.
    Charges include that he lied about his contacts when hired
by Canada to help settle a dispute over acid rain with the U.S.
And when employed by Trans World Airlines to help thwart a

The Finance Ministry approved the
banking industry's plan to cut its share in the government bond
underwriting syndicate to 73.8 pct from 74 pct from April 1 to
allow six foreign securities firms to participate, a ministry
spokesman said.
    Local and foreign securities housess may now underwrite
26.2 pct of 10-year bonds, up from 26 pct previously.
    Under a separate agreement, Japanese and foreign brokers
will allow the latter, including the six newcomers, to
underwrite five pct of the enlarged share, up from 1.19 pct,
underwriting sources said.
    The six new foreign brokers are <E.F. Hutton and Co Inc>,
<Shearson Lehman Brothers Asia Inc>, Dresdner Bank AG <DRSD.F>,
<Swiss Bank Corp International Asia Inc>, <Sogen Security Corp>
and <Swiss Union Philips and Drew Ltd>.
    The syndicate agreed after negotiation in April 1982 that
26 pct of 10-year government bonds should be underwritten by 93
securities firms, 17 of them foreign, and 74 pct by banks. The
ministry later approved the arrangement.
    The Finance Ministry is also considering public tender of
notes of over four-year maturity, adding to the current two,
three and four-year note auction, the ministry official said.
    The ministry has decided to lower the eligibility standard
for foreign brokers to participate in government note auctions
by abolishing a requirement that participants have current
accounts with the bank of Japan, the official said.
    A request by four foreign banks to join the bond
underwriting syndicate is being considered, banking sources

Clearing bank sterling lending to the
U.K. Private sector in February is estimated to have risen by
an underlying, seasonally-adjusted 1.6 billion stg after a 1.2
billion stg rise in January, the Banking Information Service
said.
    The unadjusted rise was 1.31 billion stg, compared with an
813 mln stg increase in January.
    The Banking Information Service said the adjusted rise of
1.6 billion stg was well above the recent monthly average of
about 1.0 billion stg.
    Of the increase, 297 mln stg was accounted for by personal
lending, which the Banking Information Service said was taken
up entirely by lending for home purchases.
    Lending for consumption fell around 17 mln stg while about
182 mln stg of credit card debt was repaid during the month.
    Lending to the manufacturing industry was up 370 mln stg,
and to leasing companies by 308 mln stg.
    The Banking Information Service said February fell within
the governmemnt tax season, so much of the lending was probably
the result of industry's need to pay its tax bills.
    Deposits by the private sector rose an unadjusted 1.1
billion stg in February and by a seasonally-adjusted 1.75
billion stg.
    Deposits from the public sector rose 185 mln stg in
February while deposits from overseas residents rose by 43 mln.

revised 1,100 to 11.3 pct, it said. Initially the January

    Lord Young, the Employment Minister, said there appeared
little doubt the monthly fall, which has been running at about
20,000, will continue.
    A Department spokesman said the sharp fall in February
reflected some compensation for the flat figure in January and

The main measure of U.K. Broad money,

    The narrow measure, M0, fell a provisional adjusted 3/4 to
one pct after a 0.6 pct drop in January, the Bank said.
    Unadjusted annual growth in sterling M3 was 18-3/4 to 19
pct in the 12 months to February against 17.6 pct in January
while M0 rose four to 4-1/4 pct after a 5.2 pct rise in
January.
    Seasonally adjusted, sterling bank lending grew 2.9 billion
stg after a January rise of 1.75 billion.
    Of the unadjusted counterparts to sterling M3, bank lending
to the private sector expanded 2.6 billion stg after a 1.4
billion rise in January, the Bank said.
    The public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) contracted
by 300 mln stg after a contraction of 3.7 billion stg in
January.
    Funding - debt sales to the non-bank private sector and
external flows to the public sector - rose by 300 mln stg after
a 1.5 billion stg rise in January. Of this, central government
debt sales to the public sector were expansionary by 400 mln
stg after a 1.3 billion expansion in January, the Bank said.
    Other unadjusted counterparts to sterling M3 expanded by
300 mln stg in February after an expansion of 1.3 billion stg
in January, the Bank said.
    Unadjusted figures showed a rise in sterling M3 by 1-3/4 to
two pct in February after a drop of 0.8 pct in January.
    On the same basis, the figures showed a drop of about 1-1/2
pct in MO in February after a sharp 6-1/2 pct fall in January.
    The Bank said it would publish full, final figures on March
30.
    The Bank said non-bank private sector holdings of public
sector debt fell by about 400 mln stg in February while
external flows to the public sector were about 100 mln stg.
    Combined with a net PSBR repayment of about 300 mln stg,
the public sector contribution to the growth in sterling M3 was
therefore about flat, the Bank said.
    It said seasonally adjusted bank lending, at about 2.9
billion stg in February, compared with an average of about 2.6
billion stg a month over the preceding six months.

There is no question of stimulating
consumption or relying on a systematic budget deficit or other
reflationary policies to boost the French economy, sources
close to finance minister Edouard Balladur said.
    Their comments followed remarks by prime minister Jacques
Chirac's spokesman Denis Baudouin, who said on Monday ministers
were agreed on the desirability of "relaunching" the economy.
    This sparked speculation the government was preparing for a
reflationary U-turn, but the finance ministry immediately ruled
out any such move.
    The sources today said the government's policy remained one
of "recovery," or sound finances and greater efficiency.
    They said that while 8.6 billion of the 30 billion franc
revenues expected for 1987 from a sweeping privatisation
program will go to providing public companies with fresh
capital, 21.4 billion francs, or two-thirds, will go toward
paying off national debt.
    Any further privatisation revenue this year above the 30
billion would be distributed between repayment of national
internal debt and public companies in similar proportions, they
added.
    The sources said it was absurd to talk of reflation when
the country's internal debt, expected to grow by 10 pct this
year from 1,300 billion francs in 1986 was growing twice as
fast as gross domestic product.
    Nominal GDP is expected to grow by roughly five pct this
year from 5,000 billion francs last year, broadly in line with
earlier forecasts. Real GDP will grow by up to 2.5 pct.
    The sources said that with France's economic targets for
1987 roughly in line with its main trading partners, the
government had no intention of pushing the economy to grow at
an artificial pace out of step with neighbouring economies.

Brisk increases in personal income and
consumption are to appear in February data released today, but
the bond market's recent sluggishness suggests there will be no
major price reaction unless the rises are much larger than
expected, economists said.
    Personal income is forecast to rise by 0.6 to 0.8 pct,
compared with no change in January, while consumption
expenditures are projected to increase 1.4 to 1.6 pct,
reversing most of the two pct drop recorded in January.
    M-1 money supply data for the March 9 week will also be
released. An increase of some 2.3 billion dlrs is expected.    
    Peter Greenbaum of Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co Inc
expects a one pct rise in income, led by a strong gain in wage
and salary disbursements in February.
    Nonfarm payrolls expanded by 337,000 jobs in February, the
average workweek lengthened by 0.6 pct and hourly wages rose by
four cts, he noted in a report. Vigorous spending on durable
goods last month, especially cars, foreshadow a rise of at
least 1.5 pct in consumption, he added.
    The prospect of bearish data did not trouble the bond
market much yesterday, with the 30-year Treasury bond slipping
just 7/32 to 99-28/32 for a yield of 7.51 pct.
    Analysts said the market is still trapped in a narrow
range, desperately seeking direction.
    "Seasonally adjusted, it's already December in the bond
market," quipped Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co
International Inc.
    Paul Boltz of T. Rowe Price Associates Inc said the
steadiness of long bond yields around 7.5 pct, despite some
signs of a stronger economy, probably reflects expectations
that inflation will remain subdued.
    But he warned that this assumption might not be justified.
    "It took the bond market a long while to see that inflation
was not returning to double digits, and now that it has learned
that lesson, it may be a little slow to see that a four to five
pct inflation is a real possibility ahead," Boltz said in a
report.
    After trading late yesterday at 5-15/16 pct, Fed funds were
indicated by brokers to open comfortably at 5-15/16, six pct.

The liberalization of West German
capital markets in May 1985 led to a flood of financial
innovations but the lack of a secondary market for these has
diminished their acceptance, Deutsche Girozentrale - Deutsche
Kommunalbank management board member Wiegand Hennicke said.
    While innovations may be intellectualy stimulating, they
lack transparency, he told an investors' forum in West Berlin.
    "Properly functioning markets require standardized products.
This (condition) has not been met by some of the innovations,"
Hennicke said.
    The volume of zero coupon bonds and floating rate notes,
the most widely used financial innovations in Germany, stands
at four billion and 16 billion marks, respectively, a tiny
proportion of the 1,000 billion marks of bonds in circulation.
    Even for zero-coupon bonds and floating rate notes, a
secondary market had not developed, Hennicke said. One
important reason for this was the bourse turnover tax, which
was reducing the rate of return to the investors.
    West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said this
week he believed the tax could still be removed, even if its
abolition was not decided during recent coalition discussions.
    Karl-Herbert Schneider-Gaedicke, deputy management board
chairman of DG Bank Deutsche Genossenschaftsbank, said German
domestic and institutional investors had also shown
reservations about investing in participation shares.
    One of the reasons was the widely varying terms and
conditions of participation shares in West Germany. "The
investor has to scrutinize (participation shares) carefully,
before making an investment decision," Schneider-Gaedicke said.
    He added the attractiveness of participation shares could
be increased by limiting the combination possibilities of terms
and conditions and increasing safeguards for investors.
    He also urged publicizing the comparative advantage of
participation shares over ordinary shares for foreigners.
    Foreigners do not receive the corporation tax bonus granted
to domestic investors for share dividends.
    Karl Thomas, head of the Bundesbank's credit department,
said the domestic investor had missed earnings opportunities
over the last four years by failing to invest in German bonds.
    Domestic investors did not believe interest rates would
decline and stay at low levels for such a long time, because
expectations were determined by sharp interest rate
fluctuations at the start of the decade.
    The Bundesbank has a natural interest in seeing domestic
savings channelled into bonds and shares, Thomas said.
    A shift of savings into long-term assets would dampen
monetary expansion and foster a stable rise of the money
supply, he said.

The U.K. Treasury said its 1987/88
budget arithmetic which was unveiled on Tuesday "took full
account of likely proceeds" from the sale of the government's
remaining 31.7 pct stake in British Petroleum Co PLC (BP.L).
    A statement issued by the Treasury said "the BP announcement
therefore makes no difference to our estimate of privatisation
proceeds in 1987/88, or to subsequent years, which remains 5.0
billion stg a year."
    "It makes no difference to the PSBR (Public Sector Borrowing
Requirement) which the Chancellor set in the budget," it said.
    "It has nothing to do with the future scope for tax cuts."
    The Treasury's move was prompted by press speculation,
officials said, which followed last night's surprise
announcement by the government. It currently holds about 578.5
mln shares in BP.
    The Treasury statement said that the sell-off "is simply a
part of the government's continuing privatisation programme,
the overall size of which was announced in the Autumn
(economic) Statement" (last November).
    It said the BP proceeds "will be received in installments,
of which the first will be in 1987/88."
    News of the privatisation weighed down both BP's share
price in London and the equity market overall, market sources
said.
    The prospect of so much more BP paper in circulation had
cut BP shares at 1340 GMT to 824 pence from yesterday's London
close of 828 pence. The company's shares had been down as low
as 802 pence before rebounding, stock market sources said.
    Worries over the ability of the London stock market to
digest the BP and other privatisation issues sent the Financial
Times/Stock Exchange 100 Share Index down 9.1 points by 1340
GMT to 1997.5 from last night's close. At one point the index
was as low as 1989.1, the sources said.

Hopes mounted for an agreement on cocoa
buffer stock rules at an International Cocoa Organization,
ICCO, council meeting which opened here today, delegates said.
    Both producer and consumer ICCO members said after the
opening session that prospects for an agreement on the cocoa
market support mechanism were improving.
    "The chances are very good as of now of getting buffer stock
rules by the end of next week," Ghanaian delegate and producer
spokesman Mama Mohammed told journalists.
    Consumer spokesman Peter Baron called the tone of the
negotiations "optimistic and realistic."
    The ICCO council failed to agree on buffer stock rules when
a new International Cocoa Agreement came into force in January,
with deep differences of opinion precluding serious discussions
on the matter at that time. The existing buffer stock of about
100,000 tonnes of cocoa was frozen, with a funds balance of 250
mln dlrs.
    The ICCO made buffer stock rules negotiations a priority at
this semi-annual council meeting in order to stop the slide in
world cocoa prices.
    Consumers and producers agreed yesterday on the principles
as a basis for negotiations.
    The council broke for lunch, and reconvenes at 1500 hrs. A
working group which has been meeting since Monday will tackle
the buffer stock rules issue again at 1600 hrs, when ICCO
executive director Kobena Erbynn presents a fleshed-out version
of a draft proposal he prepared earlier this week, delegates
said.
    Mohammed said delegates will have a much clearer indication
of prospects for an accord after details of the rules are
elaborated by Erbynn, and after producers and consumers meet
separately later today to examine the scheme.
    The draft proposal included three principles: a limit to
non- member cocoa comprising the buffer stock, an offer system
for buying buffer stock cocoa, and price differentials to be
paid for various cocoas making up the buffer stock, delegates
said.
    During the morning council session, the Ivory Coast
delegation gave "an open minded statement" that it is willing to
work out a buffer stock rules solution which could come into
effect as soon as possible, Baron said.
    Ivorian Agriculture Minister Denis Bra Kanon, chairman of
the ICCO council, was now expected to arrive in London Monday
to attend the talks, Baron said. Vice chairman Sir Denis Henry
of Grenada chaired the meeting in his place.
    Soviet and East German delegates did not attend the council
session because of a conflicting International Sugar
Organization meeting today, but could arrive this afternoon,
delegates said.

Dr. Ing. H.C.F. Porsche AG <PSHG.F>
said earnings in first half year 1986/87 were "satisfactory"
despite burdens caused by the dollar's weakness against the
mark and stagnating domestic demand.
    In its semi-annual shareholders' report, Porsche said first
half turnover fell six pct to 1.71 billion marks from 1.83
billion in the same period of 1985/86.
    However, earnings were satisfactory, it said, without
giving absolute figures.
    Domestic turnover fell 26 pct to 283 mln marks from 380
mln.
    Foreign turnover dipped to 1.43 billion marks from 1.45
billion in the first half of last year, although the export
quota rose to 83 pct from 79 pct.
    The car sector accounted for 1.51 billion marks of
turnover, against 1.63 billion the year earlier, it said.
    Production dropped five pct to 25,876 cars from 27,381.
Manufacture of the 911 and 928 models rose six pct to 11,122
from 10,533 units but production of 924 and 944 models was cut
by 12 pct to 14,754 units from 16,848 and would be cut further,
the report said.
    Car sales fell four pct to 25.269 units from 26,414 in the
comparable half year, the report said. U.S. Demand continued
for all models but demand fell in other markets.
    Domestic sales were 39 pct down at 3,267 units from 5,397,
while sales abroad rose five pct to 22,002 from 21,017. Share
of exports in sales rose to 87 pct from 80 pct.
    Investments were reduced to 108 mln marks from 125 mln.
    Earnings were hit by lower sales and by the lower value of
the dollar and currencies in other important markets.
    Nevertheless, sales and turnover would finish the July 11
year at a "high level," Porsche said.

Jefferies Group Inc said founder
and chairman Boyd L. Jefferies has resigned and intends to
plead guilty to two felony counts of violating federal
securities laws.
    The company said neither Boyd Jefferies nor the company
ever engaged in insider trading and neither he nor the company
ever sought or communicated insider information or violated ny
trust of confidence placed in them by customers.  It said no
governmental authority has ever alleged any such activity on
Boyd Jefferies' part or the part of the company.
    The company said Boyd Jefferies has consented to an
administrative order barring him from the securities business
for at least five years and he has agreed to place his 13 pct
holding in Jefferies Group stock in a voting trust during that
period.
    The company said, without admitting any allegations made by
the Securities and Exchange Commission, Boyd Jefferies,
Jefferies Group and primary brokerage subsidiary Jefferies and
Co also consented to an injunction barring any future
securities laws violations.
    It said Jefferies and Co has agreed further to undertake
reviews to assure that its internal recordkeeping and other
control systems are in compliance with federal laws.
    The company said president and chief operating officer
Frank E. Baxter will assume the added duties of chief executive
officer.  Boyd Jefferies had been chief executive.
    The company said the criminal charges against Boy Jefferies
resulted from a transaction in which, on behalf of Jefferies
and Co, he agreed to purchase stocks from entities controlled
by Ivan F. Boesky and later resell the stock to the Boesky
firms.
    It said "Within days of the purchase, the market value of
one of the stocks fell sharply and, pursuant to their
agreement, a Boesky entity paid Jefferies and Co three mln dlrs
to offset the loss.
    The company said Boyd Jefferies will admit that following
the loss he ordered that Boesky receive a bill for three mln
dlrs for investment advisory and corporate finance services,
although Jefferies and Co treated the three mln dlrs as an
offset to the losses it experienced.
    It said by rendering the involice, Boyd Jefferies
apparently enabled one of the Boesky entities to make a false
entry in its books, resulting in the charge, to which Boyd
Jefferies will plead guilty, of aiding and abetting one of the
Boesky firms in making false entries on its books.
    The company said Boyd Jefferies will also plead guilty to a
margin violation resulting from a transaction in which he
caused Jefferies and Co to buy shares at the request of a
customer in the company's trading account.
    It was expected that the customer would be responsible for
any loss on the shares and would also receive any profit, and
because the customer had not put up any funds for the purchase,
Boyd Jefferies had in effect caused Jefferies and Co to finance
the full purchase price for the shares in violation of margin
requirements, the company said.
    The company quoted Boyd Jefferies as saying, "I fully
accept sole responsibility for these transactions.  I think it
is appropriate that I suffer the consequences for my actions
rather than the company."
    Jefferies Group said it expects no impact on its operations
or client base from Boyd Jefferies' departure.

Energy Secretary John Herrington
said his proposed option to raise the oil depletion allowance
to 27.5 pct was probably the most economically promising way to
spur domestic production.
    The White House has said it would consider the option
although it was generally opposed to any revisions in the new
tax code.
    Herrington told a meeting of the Mid-Continent Oil and Gas
Association that the higher depletion allowance on new oil and
enhanced oil recovery would cost taxpayers about 200 mln dlrs a
year.
    The option was one of many contained in a report on oil and
the national security the Energy Department sent to the White
House on Tuesday.
    Herrington said of the increased depletion allowance
option: "that is one that could significantly increase
production at a very low cost to the American taxpayer."
    He again rejected an oil import fee as far too costly to
the overall U.S. economy.

U.S. personal income rose 0.9 pct,
or 32.4 billion dlrs, in February to a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 3,581.3 billion dlrs, the Commerce Department
said.
    The increase followed a revised 0.2 pct rise in personal
income during January. Earlier, the department estimated
January personal income was unchanged.
    The February incomes rise was the largest monthly increase
since a 1.2 pct rise in April 1986, the department said. It
attributed last month's rise to several factors, including
subsidy payments to farmers and government pay raises.
    The department said personal consumption expenditures were
up during February by 1.7 pct or 49.1 billion dlrs to 2,855.9
billion dlrs after falling by 58.4 billion dlrs or two pct in
January.
    Purchases of durable goods were up 24.8 billion dlrs last
month after decreasing by 69.7 billion dlrs in January with
sales of motor vehicles accounting for most of the February
increase and the January decline, the department said.
    Purchases of nondurables rose 10.7 billion dlrs in February
after a 300 mln dlr increase in January.
    The Commerce Department said wage and salary incomes were
up 15.6 billion dlrs in February after an 8.6 billion dlr rise
in January.
    Manufacturing payrolls increased by 2.4 billion dlrs last
month after rising 1.9 billion dlrs in February with the gains
widespread through durable and nondurable industries, the
department said.
    Farmers' incomes increased by 12.2 billion dlrs in February
after declining by 8.7 billion dlrs in January. Both last
month's increase and January's fall in farm incomes was because
of government subsidy payments, the department said.
    Personal tax and nontax payments fell 5.5 billion dlrs in
February following a 19.5 billion dlrs January drop. The 
declines were a result of the Tax Reform Act of 1986.
    Federal withheld income taxes were up in February from a
month earlier but that was offset by declines in federal
nonwithheld taxes and lower state and local income taxes.
    Disposable personal income in February after taxes was up
1.2 pct or 37.8 billion dlrs to 3,063.4 billion dlrs after
rising 25.8 billion dlrs in January.
    The personal savings rate eased to 3.6 pct in February from
four pct in January, the department said.

Deutsche Babcock AG
<DBCG.F> expects profits to rise in the current financial year
ending September 9 although the earnings level is still
unsatisfactory, managing board chairman Helmut Wiehn said.
    He told a news conference that business during the year had
weakened somewhat but was still generally positive.
    Sales during the first five months to February was 1.26
billion marks, 46.7 pct down from the same 1985/86 period.
However, he expected turnover for the year to be approximately
unchanged from the previous year's 5.14 billion marks when
current orders from major projects are booked.
    Wiehn said incoming orders in the first five months to end-
February totalled 2.50 billion marks compared with 2.04 billion
for the same period in 1985/86. They included a 45.8 pct
increase in domestic orders to 1.57 billion marks.
    Orders in hand for the five months were 16.7 pct higher at
8.64 billion marks.
    Wiehn added that Babcock was still aiming for a three pct
yield on turnover. In the year to September 1986 group profits
totalled 39 mln marks on sales of 5.14 billion against the
previous year's 32 mln on 5.11 billion marks.
    Parent company turnover was unchanged at 25.6 mln marks.
    Wiehn said Babcock's liquidity had clearly improved in the
current business year, with financial reserves in the first
five months rising by 237 mln marks to 831 mln after increasing
by 408 mln marks to 594 mln in 1985/86.
    He said pre-tax earnings per share for 1985/86, according
to the DVFA method, were 26.95 marks from 21.40 marks and
earnings after tax rose to 10 marks from 8.10.
    The company earlier said dividend will be unchanged at
three marks for ordinary shares and 3.50 marks for preference
shares.

Industries Inc said the company estimates 1986 earnings to be
between 800,000 and 900,000 dlrs, or 22 to 25 cts per share,
compared with 852,000 dlrs, or 33 cts per share, during 1985.
    The company said preliminary estimates of 1986 revenues is
24.5 mln dlrs, compared with 7,900,000 for 1985.
    The estimated 1986 results are based on 3,207,000 shares
outstanding, compared to 2,566,000 shares outstanding for 1985.
    R. Steven Lutterbach, chairman, said net income for 1986
was adversely affected primarily due to lower operating margins
at the company's Western Environmental subsidiary, and to an
increase in bad debt reserves.
    Western Environmental was acquired in March 1986.
Lutterbach explained the company has taken steps to improve
financial and accounting controls, primarily at Western, which
were not adequate at the time of acquisition.
    He noted the final results for the fourth quarter will
depend on the allocation of increased costs between the second
and fourth quarters.
    Lutterbach said it is possible second quarter results will
be restated, though final net income for the year will remain
in the estimated range.
    He added preliminary indications for first quarter 1987
revenues were favorable.

Energy Secretary John Herrington
said he would rule out a tax on gasoline as one option to help
avert what his departmet has called the threat of increased
reliance on foreign oil in the coming years.
    He said at a news conference that any recommendation he
would make would have to increase domestic production, not
cause widespread economic hardship and have a minimal cost to
the U.S. taxpayer.
    On the grounds of increasing production, he said, "I would
rule out a gasoline tax."
    Herrington also repeated he would rule out an oil import
fee because of the widespread dislocation it would cause -- the
loss of about 400,000 jobs nationwide due to higher oil prices
and a drop in the gross national product by about 32 billion
dlrs.
    He said an increased depletion allowance, to 27.5 pct, on
new and enhanced production of oil and natural gas would be a
cheap way to spur domestic production.
    He estimated this cost at about 200 mln dlrs a year.
    Herrington proposed the increased depletion allowance to
the White House Tuesday but the White House reaction was cool.
    The White House said it would study the proposal, but was
generally oppposed to altering the national tax code, just
passed last year.
    Herrington, asked his reaction to the White House reaction,
said, "If I were the White House, I would be cool, too."

Land damaged by wind in the 10-state
Great Plains amount to nearly 3.7 mln acres so far this year,
one-third more than the 1970-84 average and 300,000 acres more
than the amount reported at this time last year, the U.S.
Agriculture Department said.
    In addition to the land reported damaged, another 15 mln
acres are unprotected and susceptible to wind damage, 34 pct
more than the 1970-84 average, but about one mln acres less
than last year.
    The states hardest hit were in the Northern Plains, where
wind damaged 2.4 mln acres, an increase of 1.5 mln acres over
the amount reported a year ago, the department said.
    Suffering the most damage in the Northern Plains were
Montana (1.3 mln acres), and North Dakota (518,500 acres.)
    Of the five Southern Plains states, only Colorado reported
an increase in wind-damaged land over last year, it said.
    Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Kansas reported a reduction
in damaged land, due in part to emergency conservation tillage
practices and in part to rainfall and weather conditions.
    Of the land damaged, 96.2 pct was cropland, 3.5 pct
rangeland, and 0.9 pct was other land.
    Inadequate snow cover and high winds, coupled with a lack
of erosion control practices such as windbreaks and
conservation tillage, contributed to the increased wind damaged
land in some areas, the department said.
    Data on wind damage is collected during November-June.

The U.S. Agriculture Department is
proposing tighter federal standards setting allowable limits on
insect infestations in grain shipments.

    -- Establishing equal tolerances for the number of live
insects in shipments of food grains, feed grains and oilseeds.
    -- Revising the definition of "infested" to give equal value
to all insects injurious to grain.
    -- Establishing lower levels of infestations. In 1988, the
infested level would be set at three or more live insects per
representative sample (about 100 grams), in 1990 two or more
insects, and in 1992 the final infestattion level would be set
at one or more live insects per representative sample.
    -- Revising the definition of sample grade by adding a
limit of 10 live or dead insects per sample.
    -- Revising the definition of sample grade for wheat by
adding a limit of 32 insect-damaged kernels per 100 grams of
wheat.

Pillsbury Corp, reporting lower
earnings for the third quarter ended February 28, said a strong
performance by its Foods Group was offset by Restaurants Group
declines.
    Excluding unusual items, it said restaurants operating
profit was down in the quarter 12 pct from a year ago as sales
rose four pct.
    It said Burger King USA and Bennigan's reported higher
operating profit, but profits fell sharply at Steak and Ale,
which introduced a new menu.
    Pillsbury also reported lower profits at Distron, Burger
King's distribution arm, and said increased investment spending
on developing concepts - QuikWok, Bay Street and Key West Grill
- hurt results.
    It said Foods operating profit, excluding unusual items,
rose 10 pct with international operations and domestic breads
and baking products major contributors to improvement in the
quarter.
    A turnaround in grain merchandising was a major factor in
profit improvement for the nine months, Pillsbury said.
    Pillsbury said corporate expense showed a 4.3 mln dlr
profit in the quarter reflecting a 10.5 mln dlr gain on the
sale of a joint interest in an Australian food company and
lower corporate expenses, largely as a result of an early
retirement program initiated a year ago.
    Earlier, Pillsbury reported fourth quarter earnings of 48.5
mln dlrs, or 56 cts a share, down from 55.4 mln dlrs, or 63 cts
a share a year ago. Sales advanced to 1.53 billion dlrs from
1.46 billion dlrs.
    Pillsbury said loss of investment tax credits under the
1986 Federal Tax Reform Act reduced per-share earnings by nine
cts in the quarter and 19 cts in the nine months.
    As a result of the act, it said its effective income tax
rate rose eight points to 48.1 pct in the quarter and 5.5
percentage points to 49.7 pct for the nine months.

Repligen Corp said it intends
to file an investigational new drug application to the Food and
Drug Administration seeking permission to test its AIDS vaccine
in humans by the early summer.
    Repligen said the human tests could begin by the end of the
year.
    "We are sufficiently encouraged and impressed by the work
to date to go ahead with a clinical trial," said Michael Egan,
manager of business development for Repligen, a biotechnology
company.
    Repligen's Egan said the vaccine contains a subfragment of
the protein coat of the AIDS virus. In animal tests, which
included primates, Egan said the vaccine provoked neutralizing
antibodies to the AIDS virus and broader cellular immunity.
    Egan said the approach Repligen is using to deliver its
vaccine, using standard vaccine methods, may be safer than
vaccines using a live smallpox virus to carry proteins found on
the surface coat of the AIDS virus.
    Yesterday, Bristol-Myers Co <BMY> said it would seek
regulatory permission to test its AIDS vaccine, which uses a
smallpox virus, in humans by the end of the month.
    Repligen's AIDS vaccine is a collaborative effort of the
company, Centocor Inc <CNTO>, Duke University Medical School
and the National Cancer Insitutes. The research teams are
directed by John Ghrayeb of Centocor, Scott Putney of Repligen,
Dani Bolognesi at Duke and Robert Gallo and Flossie Wong-Staal
at the National Cancer Institute.
    Although there are several AIDS vaccine candidates, experts
believe that development of a safe and effective vaccine is a
long ways away. Moreover, seeking approval to test a vaccine is
only the first step in a long process of verifying if the
vaccine actually will prevent infection.

The water supply outlook for most of
the Western U.S. states this summer looks dim, the U.S.
Agriculture Department said.
    Snowpack and precipitation were well below normal
throughout much of the West as of last week.
    Eight of the 12 states in which the department collects
data reported snowpack and precipitation at three-quarters or
less of normal.
    It said unless late winter snows or spring rains bring
relief, these states can expect possible water shortages this
summer.
    Major water users, including agricultural producers,
municipalities and industry, should begin conservation measures
now to avoid water rationing later, USDA said.
    The department said California, one of the country's major
agricultural producers, is the driest, with snowpack and
precipitation so far this year at less than half of normal.
    Nevada, Idaho, Utah, Montana, Wyoming, Oregon and
Washington also report significant shortages despite pockets of
near normal to above noral rainfall in some areas, the
department said.
    Arizona and Alaska have higher than normal snowpack and
precipitation, while Colorado and New Mexico are near normal,

Britoil Plc's <BTOL.L> exploration
expenditure for the U.K. In 1987 was likely to be only about a
third of the level in 1986, though overseas expenditure would
remain approximately the same, Chief executive David Walker
said.
    He told reporters following the release of the company's
1986 figures that project expenditure would also remain at 1986
levels.
    U.K. Project expenditure in 1986 rose to 208 mln stg from
184 mln while exploration expenditure dropped to 87 mln from
156 mln. Overseas exploration fell to 28 mln from 58 mln in
1985.
    Earlier, Britoil posted a drop in pretax profit for 1986 to
134 mln stg from 759 mln in 1985, before an extraordinary
charge of 50 mln stg on the company's U.S. Assets. The results
were slightly better than analysts forecast and the share
firmed to 231p from 222p at last night's close. Chairman Sir
Philip Shelbourne said the collapse in the oil price in 1986
had made the period extremely difficult but the company had
come through remarkably well.
    Provided the recovery in oil prices was maintained, the
conditions would be right for a substantially improved
performance this year.
    He added that the firmness of oil prices in March, when
they were normally weaker, made him "a bit encouraged" about the
prospects for future levels.
    Walker added that Britoil would feel confident if the price
stayed within a band of 15 dlrs to 20 dlrs a barrel.
    Britoil had received some 100 responses to its announcement
of a desire to sell the assets and was asking for bids by the
latter part of April.
    End-year reserves rose to 603 mln barrels of oil compared
with 503 mln previously. However, Walker noted that this
included a revised definition of reserves.
    If 1985 figures were restated along the same lines, the
reserve figure would show a drop from 720 mln barrels
previously.
    Gas reserves also eased to 3,568 billion cubic feet from a
restated 3,660 billion.

GTE Corp is raising 250 mln dlrs
through an offering of debentures due 2017 yielding 8.737 pct,
said sole underwriter UBS Securities Inc.
    UBS, the U.S. unit of Union Bank of Switzerland, won the
issue in competitive bidding against syndicates led by such
major U.S. houses as First Boston and Morgan Stanley.
    UBS has become the second foreign firm to manage an issue
in the domestic debt market this year, following Daiwa
Securities America Inc. However, investment bankers noted that
UBS was the first foreigner to break into the U.S. market when
it won a competitive bidding in June 1986.
    An officer on UBS's corporate syndicate desk said the GTE
issue is the fourth that the securities firm has managed.
    UBS bid the GTE debentures at 97.0025 and set a coupon of
8-1/2 pct and reoffering price of 97.50 to yield 112 basis
points over the off-the-run 9-1/4 pct Treasury bonds of 2016.
    Non-refundable for 10 years, the issue is rated A-3 by
Moody's and A-minus by Standard and Poor's.
    GTE last tapped the debt market when it sold on November
20, 1986, 250 mln dlrs of same-maturity, same-rated debt priced
to yield 9.388 pct, or 174 basis points over comparable
Treasury paper, underwriters noted.
    Underwriters said that two of the UBS-lead offerings were
negotiated deals. UBS won the other two issues in competitive
bidding acting as sole underwriter.
    Daiwa, the U.S. unit of Daiwa Securities Co Ltd of Japan,
ran the books for a March 11 offering of 200 mln dlrs of
10-year notes of Rockwell International Corp <ROK>,

    Thus far, Nomura Securities International Inc is the only

Federal regulators said Boyd
Jefferies, who resigned as head of his Los Angeles brokerage
firm, took part in schemes to manipulate the price of a stock
and in a stock "parking" plot with inside trader Ivan Boesky.
    In a civil complaint filed in U.S. District Court in New
York, the Securities and Exchange Commission said Jefferies
agreed with an unidentified person to have his firm buy up a
large chunk of stock being issued in a public offering.
    Under the agreement, the firm, Jefferies and Co, drove the
price of the stock up by one-eighth point by buying four blocks
of the stock at or near the close of trading, the SEC said.
    Jefferies and Co's purchases of the unidentified stock
accounted for 66 pct of the total trading volume of the stock
on that day and were aimed at manipulation, the SEC said.
    The complaint did not identify the company whose stock was
being traded, but said that the Jefferies and Co purchases took
place sometime last year when another unidentified company,
which owned a controlling interest in the company, sold several
million shares of the stock in a secondary public offering.
    The stock purchases were made on the New York Stock
Exchange and the Pacific Stock Exchange, the SEC said.
    The person who made the alleged stock manipulation
agreement with Jefferies was also not identified.
    But the person was later billed by Jefferies and Co in a
phony invoice marked for investment banking services for the
exact amount the firm lost on the deal when it later sold the
stock on the open market, the SEC said.
    The payment, the amount of which was also not revealed in
the complaint, was made later by another unidentified person
after Jefferies sent a second invoice for a lesser amount, the
SEC said. The firm recorded the payment as "other income," it
said.
    William McLucas, associate director of enforcement at the
SEC, declined to say why the agency decided against revealing
the identities of other persons and companies involved in the
stock manipulation scheme.
    "We just made a determination that this was the way to go
at this time," McLucas told

A-2 from A-1.
    Merrill's Prime-1 commercial paper was not under review.
    Moody's said that while Merrill's absolute earnings would
continue to increase, the house's profitability will lag that
of its peers. And Merrill's attempts to improve profitability
will be constrained by accelerating competition, Moody's said.
    Moody's also said Merrill Lynch would continue to
aggressively commit its capital to such merchant banking
activities as bridge financing.
    "These activities elevate the risk content of Merrill's
balance sheet at the same time as low profitability inhibits
the strong internal capital generation which may be necessary
to support business expansion efforts," Moody's said.

French gross domestic product will grow
by only 1.5 pct in real terms this year, compared with the
government's forecast of two to 2.5 pct growth, the private
Institut des Previsions Economiques et Financieres pour le
Developpement des Entreprises (IPECODE) said.
    However, it expects growth to recover next year to the 1986
level of two pct.
    IPECODE said demand and production would develop in
parallel this year, in contrast to last year when production
was unable to keep pace with the strong rise in domestic
demand, unleashing higher import demand.
    Claims on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) rose by 298
mln francs to 19.61 billion francs, due to net withdrawals in
francs by member nations, and an increase in reserves of
Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) due mainly to the repayment of
French debts.
    Its deficit with the European Monetary Cooperation Fund
(FECOM) remained unchanged in February at 33.90 billion francs.
    French household consumption, which rose by 3.1 pct last
year, is likely to grow by just 1.1 pct this year and 1.5 pct
in 1988, it added.
    Industrial investment is expected to rise by 4.3 pct this
year and 5.5 pct in 1988, down from 6.5 pct in 1986.
    Inflation, which was running at 2.1 pct at the end of 1986,
is likely to rise to 2.9 pct at the end of this year, IPECODE
said, while the government has forecast 2.5 pct.
    However, the institute said inflation would fall back to
2.5 pct at the end of 1988, "provided that real wage costs

French Social Affairs and Labour Minister
Philippe Seguin has renewed a controversy over whether France
is positioning itself for an economic U-turn, saying it was
possible to boost domestic demand without giving rise to
negative economic effects.
    Prime Minister Jacques Chirac's spokesman, Denis Baudouin,
on Monday sparked speculation of a reflation hitherto excluded
by the government when he said ministers were agreed on the
desirability of "relaunching the economy." 
    The Finance Ministry, however, swiftly ruled out the option
of reinflation policies to boost domestic demand, which were
tried and abandoned by the previous Socialist government.
    Earlier today sources close to Finance Minister Edouard
Balladur reiterated policy remained one of restoring sound
finances and enhancing economic competitiveness.
    But political analysts said Baudouin's statements showed
growing divisions over electorally sensitive social issues
among the rightist RPR-UDF coalition, ahead of its bid next
year to capture the presidency from Socialist president
Francois Mitterrand.
    While the government has achieved lower inflation, a better
foreign trade balance and an overwhelmingly successful
privatisation programme, unemployment has continued to edge
upwards, reaching its present record rate of 10.9 pct, with
more than 2.5 mln jobless.
    Seguin, who holds direct responsibility for dealing with
unemployment, told a press lunch, "Everything depends on what
you call reflation...One can arrive at the results of a
reflation without passing through the perverse effects of a
reflation."
    He said conservative prime minister Jacques Chirac would
announce in the next few days a package of capital endowments
for state-owned enterprises including public works and motorway
building.  And while sources at Seguin's ministry said the
package could total 12 billion francs for 1987, sources close
to Balladur, making no mention of public works, said only 8.6
billion francs had been set aside for capital endowments.
    Seguin said the advantage of public works was that they
were non-inflationary and had a fast job-creating power.

Owners of two aluminum smelters in
Kentucky received temporary relief from higher electric rates
after a decision Tuesday by state regulators denying a rate
hike to (Big Rivers Electric Corp) of Henderson, Ky.
    But the owners of the smelters, (National Southwire
Aluminum Co) and Alcan Aluminium Ltd <AL>, said further
viability of the operations would depend in part upon how the
rate case is eventually settled.
    "We're hoping for no rate increases but we can't say for
sure. It's still possible we'll have to close the smelter," a
National Southwire spokesman said. He said there were other
variables to consider in any decision whether to close or
continue the smelter, located in Hawesville, about 60 miles
west of Louisville.
    National Southwire is owned by National Intergroup Inc
<NII>, which holds about 55 pct, and (Southwire Co), which
holds the rest, the spokesman said.
    A spokesman for Montreal-based Alcan said, "The decision is
48 pages long and is in legal-ese, so it certainly will be a
long time before we can make a decision" about what it means
for the Sebree smelter in Henderson, about 100 miles west of
Louisville. "But we're delighted that Big Rivers Electric was
denied the requested rate increase."
    A spokesman for the utility, a cooperative that generates
and wholesales electricity to four distributors, said the
requested increase was 7.5 mln dlrs a year over 1985 rates.
    The Kentucky Public Service Commission, in denying the
increase, asked the utility to meet with creditors, which
include Manufacturers Hanover Corp <MHC> and Irving Bank Corp
<V>, and the smelters, to renegotiate a rate plan, the utility
spokesman said.
    The commission suggested that Big Rivers Electric work out
a flexible rate schedule with the smelters that would index
their electric costs to the price of aluminum, he said.
    "We have always been amenable to try, as far as we can, to
assure that the two aluminum smelters remain viable," he said.
    No meetings are scheduled and none have been planned
between the utility, its creditors and the aluminum plant
owners. The commission has set a hearing on the rate issue for
July 28.

A former vice president of Painewebber
Inc pleaded guilty in Manhattan Federal Court to charges he
conspired to launder over 700,000 dlrs in cash from investors.
    Gary Eder, 41, PaineWebber's highest paid broker between
1982-86, was indicted last week on charges of conspiracy and
falsifying brokerage records.
    Eder, who resigned from the firm earlier this year,
admitted he received cash from various clients, and converted
the funds to smaller amounts to avoid reporting requirements by
the U.S. Internal Revenue Service.
    Eder said he did not profit directly from the transactions
except for the commissions he received.
    U.S. District Judge Edmund Palmieri scheduled May 27 for
sentencing. Eder could receive up to five years in jail on each
count and 260,000 dlrs in fines.
    Eder had been accused of plotting with unidentified
supervisors at PaineWebber to prevent the filing of currency
transaction reports with the IRS. Under U.S. law, cash
transactions of 10,000 dlrs or more must be reported to the
IRS.
    David Spears, the Federal prosecutor in charge of the case,
said Eder received cash from customers in amounts up to 70,000
dlrs at one time, and then broke the cash down into amounts
under 10,000 dlrs and put the money into accounts on several
different days.
    Outside of Court, Eder's lawyer, Milton Gould, said his
client was not involved in the ongoing Wall Street insider
trading scandel. Rather, Gould said, "Eder accomodated some
wealthy customers (who wanted to avoid taxes)."

The stock market could be jolted one
way or another on Friday as the so-called triple witching
expiration raises the specter of volatile movement.
    The Dow Jones Industrial Average could soar or plunge as
much as 100 points, or both, or even remain static, according
to analysts of the stock and stock index futures markets.
    The simultaneous expiration of March stock index futures
contracts, options on these futures and options on the indexes
themselves, along with options on individual stocks, has
created a mad scramble during several previous "witching
hours."
    Upon expiration of these vehicles, investment managers must
find a place for their funds, and in the past the final hour
has seen a tremendous surge in New York Stock Exchange volume.
    Analysts said the overriding influence of the stock
market's steady climb this year -- and the absence of
worthwhile investment alternatives -- may indicate that the
major players will look to buy into the stock market as the
final hour transpires this friday.
    "I think there will be a substantial swap out of futures
(positions) and into stocks," Jeffrey Miller, of Miller Tabak
Hirsch and Co said. "(But) I've got a streak of four or five in
a row of being right, so I'm bound to be wrong."
    The feeling among some analysts is that the largest money
managers will do the same thing they did at December's
expiration when they plunged their multi-billion dollar funds
into the stock market.
    "Last time, during triple-expiration, there was a
tremendous amount of stock sold, which was offset by huge buy
programs late," said Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette Inc analyst
William Marcus.
    Some stock funds quickly place newly arrived investment
dollars into buying futures positions, Miller said. Then, upon
the expiration of the futures, the manager looks to transform
that into a stock portfolio, he said.
    The coming month is also a seasonally strong period for the
stock market, Stotler and Co analyst David Hightower said,
because of the influx of income tax refunds.
    Although Hightower recommended steering clear of trading
during the witching hour, he suggested buying if the market
plunges, believing that the slide would only be temporary.
    Marcus said it was difficult to make a prediction as to
which way the market will go on Friday, partly because many
investors will be engaging in "window-dressing."
    The public disclosure of order imbalances in individual
stocks a half hour before the close may reveal an opportunity
to those investors seeking either to buy or get rid of stocks,
offsetting whatever impact the initial imbalances show.
    Analysts said efforts by exchanges to quell the volatility
on triple-expirations are unlikely to substantially alter the
impact of futures and options on the stock market. Money
managers are sure to find other types of loopholes that emerge
under the new rules, they said.

The American Petroleum Institute
said that U.S. crude oil production in February declined 9.8
pct from year-ago levels to about 8.3 mln barrels a day.
    In its monthly report on U.S. oil supplies and stocks, API
said that domestic demand for petroleum products, as measured
by products supplied, continued to rise reaching 16.3 mln
barrels a day in the month, up 1.5 pct from February 1986.
    API noted the drop in crude oil output coupled with a
drop in natural gas liquids production, which was off 11 pct
from February 1986 levels, represented a decline in U.S.
production of more than one mln barrels a day.
    API said the decline in domestic production and the rise in
demand brought petroleum imports to about six mln barrels a day
in February, a 30.3 pct increase from last year's level.
    So far this year, API said growth in domestic demand, which
was up 2.9 pct from last year's year-to-date level, has slowed
in comparison to the accelerated growth in the last half of
1986.
    It said crude oil production for the first two months of

crude imports were up 30.6 pct.

Consumers may benefit from new
telephone services if business restrictions against the
regional Bell companies are eased, but safeguards against rate
hikes may be needed, congressional and industry analysts say.
    An easing of the restrictions by the U.S. District Court
would help bring new services to markets that the regional
firms are currently prohibited from serving, the analysts say.
    But consumer groups add that there is a danger the regional
companies would raise rates to subsidize entry into new markets
and safeguards would be needed to prevent that.
    Brian Moir, a spokesman for the International
Communications Association, a national group of telephone
users, said, "If there are no safeguards, there will be higher
rates, less competition and less consumer choice."
    The seven regional Bell companies created from the breakup
of American Telephone and Telegraph Co <T> in 1984 have been
prohibited by the terms of the divestiture decree from
manufacturing equipment, offering computerized information
services or providing long-distance service.
    U.S. District Judge Harold Greene, who presided over the
divestiture and continues to enforce its terms, is currently
considering a Justice Department recommendation to eliminate
the restrictions except on long-distance service within a Bell
holding company's local service region.
    In separate filings last week, the regional Bells asked
Greene to remove restrictions, while industry and consumer
groups including the Consumer Federation of America joined ATT
in asking that all or most of them be retained.
    ATT, which has about an 80 pct share in the interstate
long-distance market, said in its filing it would not oppose
entry by the Bell companies into computerized information
services but was against their participation in long-distance
services and manufacturing equipment. ATT does not offer
computerized information services.
    ATT has asked the Federal Communications Commission, in a
separate proceeding, to reduce price and rate regulations that
have dominated the long-distance business for many years.
    Greene is expected to reach a decision on whether to ease
restrictions this year, possibly this summer, analysts said.
    "The restrictions prevent people who can provide services
from providing them," said a congressional aide.
    However, a major concern among consumer groups and
lawmakers is that the companies may subsidize those new
businesses from higher charges to their customers.
    "We're talking about activities funded directly or
indirectly off the backs of ratepayers," said Moir.
    One congressional aide said he was not worried about
subsidizing new businesses from profits, but he was concerned
that the Bell companies may overcharge consumers so that they
can invest in new services.
    Some analysts said accounting regulations would protect
consumers against cross-subsidization by the Bell companies.
    "Those are types of things that really do need review," said
Gerry Salemme, an aide with the House Telecommunications,
Consumer Protection and Finance Subcommittee.
    He added that the House would hold hearings later this year
to examine the potential effects of reduced restrictions.
    Gene Kimmelman of the Consumer Federation, which represents
more than 200 consumer groups, said accounting regulations were
inadequate because accountants could not separate equipment
employed for traditional and new services.
    "We have yet to see adequate regulatory safeguards that
exist that prevent cross-subsidization by the Bell companies,"
Kimmelman said. "You're either asking for great increases in
rates or a great opportunity for cross-subsidization."
    One congressional aide expressed concern that lifting of
the restrictions would lead to joint ventures between U.S. and
foreign firms in manufacturing telecommunications equipment and
that could lead to a loss of American jobs. He suggested some
safeguards may be needed to protect against that happening.

The Association of German Cooperative
Banks said in a financial survey that domestic interest rates
would continue to remain low for the time being.
    It said the Bundesbank could hold them down despite strong
foreign influence and it saw no interest-straining factors in
the economy that could affect the long-term capital market.
    The inflation rate of one pct also gave no occasion for
higher nominal interest rates. But a probable rise in inflation
late this year could give very slight grounds for a rise in
nominal rates at year's end and next year, it said.
    The association said generally low interest rates,
prospects of lower taxes, a stable dollar rate and expected
strong domestic demand led it to believe that the investment
climate would remain friendly and the economy would continue
its slow but very sure growth.
    The Bundesbank had managed successfully to keep interest
rates down on the short-term money market although its policies
had exerted little effect on the long-term capital market,
which was so important for investment financing and thus for
the course of the economy, it said.
    In view of the limits to the possibilities monetary policy
had in influencing the longer-term capital market, the
association saw little sense in wanting to boost the economy
through a short-term and expansionist monetary policy.
    On the other hand it also saw no reason for sticking
dogmatically to the money supply target for the whole of 1987.
    The association said time would show to what extent
speculative foreign money and short-term invested domestic
money would distort money supply developments. The Bundesbank
could hold down money market rates with the highly effective
instrument of sale and repurchase transactions, it said.

    In a speech to a women's group here, Johnson said, "There is

    Johnson also said there was a better alignment of exchange

goal.
    Johnson said, "The Fed supports this pattern of exchange
rates ... and we'll see if it leads to a convergence in trade.
Quite possibly it can be achieved."
    Johnson said the Paris agreement achieved a better
alignment of exchange rates in exchange for stimulus by the
major surplus countries.

Slower than expected growth in Britain's
narrow M0 money supply measure in February will help spur a
further cut in U.K. Interest rates if a surge in sterling's
value requires such a move, economic analysts said.
    M0, the only targeted money supply measure left after
Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson scrapped the official
target for the broad sterling M3 measure in his 1987 budget
speech on Tuesday, fell an adjusted 3/4 to one pct in February.
    On an annual basis, this put M0 growth at four to 4-1/2
pct, in the middle of the 1987 target of two to six pct.
    "The M0 data are much better than we expected," said Robert
Thomas, economist at Greenwell Montagu Securities.
    He and other analysts said while the better than expected
M0 figures alone would not be sufficient to trigger a new
interest rate cut, they removed an obstacle to such a move.
    Thomas noted the rise in M0 had been kept in check despite
buoyant retail sales in February, advancing an adjusted 2.2 pct
after a fall of the same size in January.
    Analysts said the M0 measure, reflecting variations in
consumer demand rather than real inflation prospects, was not
an adequate indicator to determine interest rates.
    "The authorities still seem to want to pretend that M0 is
important ... In practice, it is likely to be the exchange rate
and the election which call the tune," Lloyds Merchant bank
chief economist Roger Bootle wrote in a budget comment.
    Richard Jeffrey, economist at stockbrokers Hoare Govett,
said in a comment: "It is unlikely that (Lawson) will respond to
signals from M0 alone ... Reinforcement from exchange rate
trends is necessary before action is taken."
    "With the Chancellor making clear that policy manoeuvres are
made in response to signals from this narrow money variable,
the City has been forced to take it seriously," he added.
    Noting this point, Thomas said market fears at the end of
last year of an M0 overshoot had now disappeared.
    This removed a potential obstacle to a further cut in U.K.
Base lending rates if foreign demand for sterling pushed up the
pound above unofficial targets, analysts said.
    Such targets are believed to have been secretly agreed
between finance ministers of the Group of Five and Canada at
their Paris meeting last month, they added.
  U.K. Base rates have been cut twice by half a point since the
Paris agreement, once on March 11, and again yesterday when
foreign demand for sterling surged in reaction to a sharp cut
in 1987 government borrowing targets contained in the budget.
    They stand at 10 pct now, and foreign exchange dealers and
analysts expect them to shed another half-point in the coming
week.
    Analysts shrugged off as largely irrelevant a higher than
expected increase in February sterling M3, which pushed the
annual growth rate to almost 19 pct, well above the previous
target of 11 to 15 pct.
    Thomas said the February figures seemed to indicate the
improvement in sterling M3 growth witnessed over the past few
months had been reversed, but firm conclusions could only be
drawn after revised data are released on March 31.
    Some analysts said foreign investors had long ceased to
watch the sterling M3 target, and Lawson's move to scrap it
altogether earlier this week removed whatever was left of its
credibility as a key factor in monetary policy.

Vining common, subject to certain conditions.
    Vulcan said it is dropping the proposal because it believes

The "cross field allowance" relief on
Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) announced by U.K. Chancellor of the
Exchequer Nigel Lawson this week will favour smaller non-PRT
paying fields, according to stockbrokers Wood Mackenzie and Co.
    The cross field allowance offsets up to 10 pct of
qualifying spending on a new oil field against PRT liability of
other fields. It is restricted to new offshore developments
outside the southern basin and yet to gain Annex B approval.
    A report by the stockbrokers said that on a new field not
paying PRT due to its small size, the relief would directly
benefit in PRT saving on an existing field.
    "The cross field allowance will mainly benefit participators
in those fields which have no PRT liability," the report said,
adding that the timing of development of such fields may be
advanced.
    The government would in effect be subsidising these
developments at 7.5 pct of capital expenditure before
corporation tax, the report said.
    On fields likely to pay PRT in the future, the benefit is
of timing. Although liabilities on other existing fields will
be reduced immediately, liabilities on larger new fields will
rise in the future due to the loss of offsets, it said.
    In a study on probable fields, the report said that when
the rates of return are examined, the rise for a PRT-paying
field such as Miller, the largest undeveloped oil field in the
U.K. North Sea, is from 18.7 to 19 pct, while the rise for a
small non-PRT paying field such as Kittiwake is 15.9 to 17.9
pct.
    The report added that in fields which pay PRT, there will
be a cost in being able to have this early relief. Not only
will these costs be unavailable for offset against the field's
future profits, but uplift of some 35 pct on these costs will
be lost.
    Thus, a saving of PRT of 100 when field development starts
will have to be matched by a rise in PRT of 135 at a later
time.

Several leading farm-state
Congressmen said they will press the U.S. Agriculture
Department to implement some kind of marketing loan to make
soybeans exports competitive while protecting farm income.
    Speaking at a House grains subcommittee hearing, chairman
Dan Glickman, D-Kan., proposed that Congressmen and
representatives of soybean growers meet with USDA on the
subject in the next two weeks.
    "Let's see if we can try to push them (USDA) to do
something without legislation," Glickman told the hearing.
    The current soybean loan rate effectively is 4.56 dlrs per
bushel with no income protection, or marketing loan.
    David Haggard, American Soybean Association, ASA, president
said USDA must make changes in the soybean program.
    The current soybean program "gave us the worst of both
worlds," ASA's Haggard told the hearing. The 1987 loan rate is
too high relative to corn and is encouraging an expansion of
soybean production in South America, he said. At the same time,
the U.S. soybean loan rate is too low to provide any income
support for soybean farmers, Haggard said.
    "We need some kind of market loan," he added.
    The 1985 farm bill provides authority for the Agriculture
Secretary to implement a marketing loan for soybeans but USDA
so far has resisted pressure to use the authority.
    Representatives of ASA met earlier this month with USDA,
but Haggard said USDA officials gave no indication if they
would seriously consider offering a marketing loan.
    USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz yesterday said the
soybean situation is a "dilemna" which has been studied
extensively by the department. But he did not say what, if any
changes, are under consideration.
    In his testimony, Haggard indicated there are ways other
than a marketing loan which should be considered to help
soybean growers, such as a so-called producer option payment,
or a direct payment program.
    Haggard said barring any program changes, Commodity Credit
Corporation, CCC, soybean stocks, now at 385 mln bu, will rise
to 500 mln by the end of August. A further 100 mln bu of
soybeans could be forfeited between September and end-year.
    "Thus, CCC could own the equivalent of Brazil's entire
soybean crop by the end of calendar year 1987," Haggard said.
    However, Haggard said that the U.S. should be cautious in
making soybean program changes that might allow the European
Community to challenge the U.S. program under the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, GATT.
    He noted that The EC imports one quarter of U.S. soybean
production and loss of that market would be devastating.
    The Reagan administration has given "mixed signals" on
whether it believes a marketing loan for soybeans could be
successfully challenged in GATT by the EC, Haggard said.
    While the ASA position is to support a 5.02 dlrs per bu
loan rate combined with a marketing loan, Haggard also endorsed
a proposal by Rep. Jerry Huckaby, D-La., which would set a six
dlrs per bu loan rate and apply a marketing loan.
    The Huckaby proposal is also supported by the ranking
Republican on the House Agriculture committee, Rep. Edward
Madigan of Illinois.
    Subcommittee chairman Glickman endorsed the need to take
some action on soybeans, but cautioned that the marketing loan
could mean a substantial increase in budget costs.
    Glickman noted that the Agriculture Committee must cut one
to 1.5 billion dlrs from its fiscal 1988 budget and therefore
must fit any soybean program changes into the overall budget.
    Haggard said at a soybean loan rate of six dlrs per bu
combined with a marketing loan, the U.S. soybean price might
fall to four dlrs per bu initially. This would cost the
government a maximum of two billion dlrs. But he said the costs
would decline as market prices recovered.

A U.S. House Banking subcommittee
approved a plan to seek negotiations with other industrialized
countries for the purchase of developing country debt from
commercial banks.
    The plan is expected to face opposition in the full House
Banking Committee where approval must be obtained to send it on
to the full House for a vote, congressional sources said.
    Under their plan, Treasury Secretary James Baker would be
directed to consider setting up a public debt authority to
purchase developing country debt at a discount. The debt would
be repackaged for sale to a secondary market.
    The debt plan was offered by International Development
Institutions subcommittee chairman Walter Fauntroy, a
non-voting Democratic delegate from the District of Columbia.
    The negotiations would aim for renegotiation of third world
debt with the new U.S. Public Debt Management Authority. The
new U.S. institution would act as manager for the loans and
oversee economic policies of the developing countries.
    One of its main purposes is the reduction in the debt
service burden of developing countries, Fauntroy said.
    In addition, the bill asks for a study of the issuance of
of Special Drawing Rights to developing countries.

Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc said one
of its key bottling subsidiaries is being investigated by a
grand jury for possible price fixing violations of its soft
drinks.
    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
the company said its Mid-Atlantic Coca-Cola Bottling Co
understands a federal grand jury in Norfolk, Va., is probing
the matter and it is "possible" that it will be indicted for
violating anti-trust laws.
    The current probe stems from the conviction last month of
an Allegheny Pepsi-Cola Bottling Co employee, it said.
    In the trial of the Allegheny Pepsi employee, Armand
Gravely on October 28, 1986, Mid-Atlantic Coca-Cola Bottling Co
and eight of its employees, including some high ranking
officers, were identified as unindicted co-conspirators in the
price fixing scheme, Coca-Cola Enterprises said.
    Gravely was convicted on February 12, 1987 in a scheme to
fix soft drink prices in Virginia between Allegheny Pepsi and
Mid-Atlantic Coca-Cola, the company said.
    While Mid-Atlantic Coca-Cola was not named as a defendent
along with Gravely, the company said the probe into the Gravely
case is still under way and could result in indictments.
    Coca-Cola Enterprises has already said Mid-Atlantic
Coca-Cola Bottling Co and some of its officers have been under
investigation by the Norfolk grand jury since September 1984.
    The new disclosure was made in a filing with the SEC for
offerings of 250 mln dlrs of debentures due 2017 and 250 mln
dlrs of notes due 1997.
    Proceeds would be used to refinance outstanding debts, the

"We'll be examining all our practices," Baxter said in a
telephone interview, adding, "we do not expect any changes."
    Baxter also said he does not believe that any other
Jefferies employees will be cited for wrongdoing.
    Boyd Jefferies, Jefferies Group's founder, agreed to plead
guilty to two felony counts of violating federal securities
laws, Jefferies Group said in a statement released earlier.
    The statement said the charges against Boyd Jefferies
resulted from a transaction in which he, on behalf of the

entities.
    "That was Boyd's transaction," Baxter said.
    Baxter said that although Jefferies Group was censured,
there were no fines imposed on the company and no restrictions
placed on its business. He said he believes the news of the
allegations and Boyd Jefferies resignation should not affect
client confidence.
    Michael Klowden, an attorney for Jefferies Group, said that
although investigations are continuing into trading activity in
general, he does not believe any probe is focusing on Jefferies
Group or its employees.

Council of Economic Advisers
Chairman Beryl Sprinkel called on Latin American governments to
adopt sounder economic policies and said U.S. banks' loans to
those countries had already been written down in an economic
sense.
    "Latin governments will have to adopt policies that promote
growth for their own citizens," he said, adding that the record
has been mixed.
    Brazil, he said, recently has backtracked from better
economic policies and "obviously they have to change."
    Asked if U.S. banks ultimately would be forced to write
down portions of their loans to Latin America, Sprinkel said,
"In any realistic sense, economic sense, those loans have been
written down."
    The banks could not sell the loans at par, he said, and the
price/earnings ratio of major banks' stocks has not been doing
very well.
    "Clearly the lenders have suffered," said Sprinkel.

Industrial and financial groups will be

Bourse regulations are liberalized beginning next year,
Stockbrokers' Association chairman Xavier Dupont told a news

that the monopoly of French stockbrokers to trade on domestic
bourses will be phased out by January 1992, the date for the

    Balladur said that from January 1988, the capital of the

    The minister did not specify which other institutions would
be allowed to take stakes in the brokers' capital but said that
from January 1, 1992, "access to the Bourse will be open to any
new member under the control of the Bourse authority."
    Dupont said that in opening up the capital of the 45 Paris

Transco Exploration Partners Ltd said
participation in 14 new discoveries increased its proved gas
reserves to 558.1 billion cubic feet in 1986, up from 541.5
billion cubic feet in the previous year.
    Proved reserves of liquids remained about the same at 25.1
mln barrels, the company said in the 1986 annual just released
by Transco Energy Co <E>, the majority owner of the Transco
Exploration partnership.
    Transco said that anticipated oil and gas prices during
1987 would continue to exert pressure on the profitability of
most energy companies.
    The Transco pipeline system reached permanent take-or-pay
settlements on about half its committed gas deliverability and
interim agreements for another 38 pct of its deliverability,
the annual report said. The company said it paid a total of
about 363 mln dlrs to producers through Februry one out of its
550 mln dlr reserve to settle the take-or-pay disputes.
    Transco said its gas pipeline delivered more than 1.2
trillion cubic feet last year and its marketing affiliate sold
an average of 1.6 billion cubic feet of gas per day.
    The company's exploration partnership received an average
price of 1.84 dlrs per mln cubic feet for gas sales during
1986, down from 3.04 dlrs in 1985.
    Sales of oil and condensate averaged 15.86 dlrs per barrel

Amoco Corp's petroleum liquids reserves
total 2.42 billion barrels at the end of 1986, down from 2.77
billion a year earlier, but its natural gas reserves increased
to 15.37 trillion cubic feet from 15.14 trillion, the company's
annual report said.
    It said the drop in crude oil and natural gas liquid
reserves reflected downward revisions of previous estimates
caused by the sharp drop in oil prices last year. This
accounted for 178 mln barrels of a worldwide downward revision
of 188 mln barrels, with 158 mln barrels of the total revision
occurring in the United States, the report said.
    Amoco said there were upward revisions in the size of its
worldwide gas reserves totalling 404 billion cubic feet last
year, while it discovered 568 billion cubic feet and purchased
298 billion cubic feet of reserves.
    Production of one trillion cubic feet offset much of these
gains, the report said.
    All of the gas reserve purchases, as well as all of the 14
mln barrels of oil reserves bought in 1986, were in the United
States, Amoco said, noting it has spent 1.1 billion dlrs to
acquire U.S. producing properties over the past three years.
    Commenting on 1987, Amoco said acquisitions "will be an
integral part of our strategy, should reserves become available
at attractive prices."
    The company said it expects "the marketing climate for
natural gas to improve in 1987, which should provide the
opportunity for Amoco to expand sales. As prices and demand
improve, we are poised to accelerate capital spending on our
inventory of attractive opportunities."
    Amoco previously announced a 1987 capital spending budget
of 3.2 billion dlrs. Such spending totaled 3.18 billion dlrs
last year, down from 5.31 billion in 1985.

Quebec, the government agency which manages the province's

profit of almost three billion Canadian dlrs in 1986, an
increase of 300 mln dlrs over 1985.
    The agency said in its annual statement that it had assets
with a total book value of 25 billion dlrs, or a market value
of 28 billion dlrs, at the end of 1986.
    These holdings had a rate of return of 13.5 pct in the
year, which was below the Caisse's average return of 16 pct in
the past four years and 14.2 pct in the past eight years.
    The Caisse said foreign equity investments represented 3.6
pct of total assets, while U.S. government securities accounted
for another 5.2 pct of the overall portfolio.
    The agency's holding of U.S. government securities yielded
a return of 20.7 pct for the year, significantly more than
either the 14.1 pct earned on the total bond portfolio or the
13.5 pct for all funds under management.
    "These high liquidity securities, which are held on a
temporary basis and for purposes of strategy and the protection
of the overall bond portfolio, have been efficient," the agency
said of the U.S. securities.
    The agency said it has 7.9 billion dlrs invested in
Canadian private sector businesses after channeling 965 mln
dlrs of new funds into this area in 1986.

U.S. bank discount window borrowings
less extended credits averaged 228 mln dlrs in the week to
Wednesday March 18, the Federal Reserve said.
    Total borrowings in the week rose 83 mln dlrs to 502 mln
dlrs, with extended credits up three mln dlrs at 274 mln dlrs.
The week was the first half of a two-week statement period. Net
borrowing in the prior week averaged 148 mln dlrs.
    Commenting on the two-week statement period that ended on
March 11, the Fed estimated that banks had daily average net
free reserves of 759 mln dlrs rather than the 660 mln dlrs
first reported.
    A Fed spokesman told a press briefing that there were no
large single day net misses in the Fed's reserve projections in
the first week of the latest bank statement period.
    None of the 14 large money center banks borrowed from the
discount window during the week and all of the Wednesday
borrowing was made by the smallest banks. For the week as a
whole, the borrowing was split roughly evenly between the large
regionals and the small banks.
    Natural float ranged from a low of near zero on Thursday --
for which the Fed spokesman could give no particular reason --
to a high of nearly 750 mln dlrs on Tuesday.
    The Tuesday peak included about 100 mln dlrs of
transportation float in mid- and south-Atlantic states. Noting
that the weather was "basically good" for March, the spokesman
said that transportation float averaged under 500 mln dlrs a
day for the full week.
    Float related as-ofs were a negative 400 mln dlrs on
Wenesday due to a number of unrelated cash letter error
corrections in five districts.
    As-ofs peaked at just over 500 mln dlrs on Tuesday.

Republican members of the House
Budget Committee refused to cast their votes as the committee
began marking up the outlines of next year's federal budget.
    Republicans voted "present" during votes on a ceiling for
fiscal 1988 defense spending, saying they were protesting the
Democrats' failure to present an alternative to President
Reagan's budget, which was completed in January.
    Without the Republicans' votes, the Democratic majority on
the committee voted tentatively 13-8 to cap 1988 defense
spending at 282.6 billion dlrs, three billion dlrs more than
current year defense outlays.
    Rep. William Gray (D-Pa.), the Budget Committee chairman,
decided earlier this week to use current government spending
levels as a starting point for the panel's deliberations.
    In the past, the committee Democrats had always gone behind
closed doors to agree in advance on a draft budget plan.
    But this year, the Democrats could not come to an
agreement, prompting Gray to invite the Republicans to join
them in the drafting process in open session.
    Republicans argued that this maneuver enabled the Democrats
to avoid presenting alternatives to the president's budget.

were to receive semi-annual interest payments at an annual rate
of 16 pct.
    Morgan said the complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for

voluntary liquidation of Metromedia which has intentionally
created an event of default on the notes. 
    The company said the default amount is 574.24 dlrs for each

into account the deep discount the holders received when they
bought the issue.

Sir Roy Denman, Head of the EC
Delegation in Washington, said pending U.S. trade legislation
is a misguided attempt to deal with the nation's trade deficit
and will spark retaliation if passed in its present form.
    "To think that you can deal with a trade deficit by
legislation is a mistake," he told the Foreign Trade
Association here.
    Denman told reporters that possible retaliation, which he
warned of in a letter to House Ways and Means Committee
Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, would not necessarily be on a
product-for-product basis.
    "Retaliation does not have to be matched product to
product," Denman said.
    He said in the case of textiles import restrictions,
however, retaliation would be against U.S. textile exports.
    "Certainly, if restrictions were imposed on European
exports of textiles to the U.S., the Community would be likely
to retaliate with restrictions on U.S. textile exports to
Europe," Denman said.
    He also took exception to U.S. proposals to require
countries with large current account surpluses with the U.S. to
cut those surpluses or face special tariffs.
    "This would conflict with international obligations, throw
a large wrench into the current round of trade negotiations and
could easily boomerang," he warned of the tariff proposals.
    Denman also took exception to U.S. efforts to seek
reciprocity in specific trade sectors.
    "Forcing reciprocity in one sector by imposing barriers
would simply lead to retaliation from the other party," he
said, adding that overall reciprocity can only be achieved by
trading off disadvantages in one sector for advantages in
another.

Workers at a General Motors Corp
parts plant in Michigan are scheduled to vote tomorrow on a new
contract that would change the way many of the workers do their
job.
    Some 3,000 members of the United Auto Workers at GM's
Livonia, Mich., parts plant will vote in two shifts on a local
contract to replace their current agreement with the company,
according to officials of both the union and the company.
    The proposed accord would initiate the so-called "team
concept" at the plant, which makes seat cushions and is part of
GM's Inland Division.
    Under the proposed contract, workers in one area of the
plant would be responsible for the entire product and would
make some of their own decisions about assembling that product,
said Kevin Woodward, a steward with the UAW local that
represents the workers.
    An Inland division spokesman would not discuss details of
the accord. But he said Inland has a "serious" capacity
problem.
    No wage or benefit issues are in the proposal. Those issues
are covered by a national pact between GM and the UAW. Talks on
a new national accord are expected to begin in July.
    If the contract is ratified, it would go into effect as
soon as the vote count is completed, said Ronald Catcher, a
member of the local's executive board.
    The pact would also stay in place through the next national
contract, he said.
    Catcher said the union members are sharply divided on the
new accord. "It's going to be close either way," he said.
    Many of the workers are afraid that, if the agreement is
not ratified, the plant will be shut down, union officials
said. The GM spokesman said "no decision has been made to that
effect."

Stock index-related arbitrage
trading did not spark the dramatic drop in the U.S. stock
market last September, nor is a free-fall in stocks and futures
prices due to arbitrage trading a likelihood, a top official
with the Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC, said.
    Richard Ketchum, director of SEC's division of market
regulation, told the Futures Industry Association that a
commission study of the circumstances surrounding the plunge in
the Dow Jones Industrial Average last September 11-12 shows
stock index-related arbitrage trading those days was
substantial but did not set off the price fluctuations.
    "While index-related arbitrage trading was a very
substantial part of the trading that day, it was by no means
the predominant part," Ketchum said.
    He said the study would be released next week.
    Index-related arbitrage relates to efforts, primarily by
institutional investors, to profit from price differentials by
shifting funds between stock index futures and their underlying
stocks.
    Some commodity exchange officials fear federal regulators
or Congress might move to restrict trading of stock index
futures in an effort to curb stock price volatility.
    Ketchum said the slide in stock prices was the result of a
"fundamental change in investors' perceptions of economic
conditions," triggered by "incorrect rumors" that West Germany
was set to cut its discount rate.
    The SEC study indicated the seven firms that accounted for
most of the arbitrage trading those days made 127 program
trades on September 11 and 117 trades September 12, accounting
for only 17.5 pct of the "sell side of the New York Stock
Exchange's volume," Ketchum said.
    He also said there was virtually no options index-related
arbitrage activity those days.
    Ketchum called "triple witching days" -- the Fridays each
quarter when stock index futures and options and opions on
individual stocks expire simultaneously - a "relatively minor,
overdone question" that has "relatively easy solutions."
    Moreover, "futures do not appear to have an impact on
long-term or probably even daily volatility," he said.
    Finally, Ketchum said a free-fall in stocks and futures
prices driven by program sell-offs of stock index futures and
individual stocks was unlikely.
    "We believe that the amount of money now available to come
in on the other side of the market by institutions make it
unlikely that that kind of snowballing effect would happen," he
said.
    But he said federal regulators could not discard the
possibility and would continue to be concerned by the issue.

Whether the European Community's
Council of Ministers will approve a proposed tax on vegetable
oils that has sparked threats of U.S. retaliation is uncertain,
an EC official said.
    "It is very far from certain that it will go through," Sir
Roy Denman, Head of the EC Delegation in Washington, told
reporters before he addressed the Foreign Trade Association.
    Denman noted Britain remains opposed to the plan and West
Germany has opposed it in the past.
    U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter has threatened
retaliation if the tax is approved, as it would limit U.S.
soybean exports to the EC. Council action is expected soon.
    Denman said while the EC is willing to negotiate about
agriculture in a new round of trade talks, it is unwilling to
single out export subsidies on a negotiating agenda or put
agricultural policy on a special fast track.
    "The key to a solution in this area seems to me not in the
framing of the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade)
wording...but in tackling government subsidies to farmers on
both sides of the Atlantic," he said.

President Ronald Reagan said he
would veto any tax increases voted by Congress.
    "My pledge to veto any tax rate increase remains rock solid,"
Reagan said during a televised news conference.
     The president said he opposed efforts by some members of
Congress to back away from deficit reduction targets set by the
Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law. He urged passage of a
constitutional amendment to balance the budget.
    "It's time Congress cut the federal budget and left the
family budget alone," Reagan said.
    He said the congressional budget process was in desperate
need of reform and urged passage of an amendment to the U.S.
constitution that would require a balanced federal budget.
    "This yearly deficit feeding process must stop," he added. "We
must act now to pass a constitutional amendment to balance the
budget."
    In the meantime, he said, Congress cannot back away from
the deficit reduction goals set by federal law he said.

President Reagan said the United
States must do more to lessen its reliance on imported oil.
    President Reagan said during a nationally televised news
conference that the rising U.S. reliance on foreign oil is a
problem that the administration is studying.
    "We have to study this more," Reagan said. "This is why we
increased the Strategic (Petroleum) Reserve, but we have to do
more," he said.
    Reagan said his administration has already proposed
deregulating natural gas and eliminating the windfall profits
tax on crude oil production.
    However, he complained that Congress had not yet approved
those measures.
    The Department of Energy earlier this week released a
report that warned of rising U.S. reliance on foreign oil
imports at a time when domestic production is declining. It
suggested options for the administration to consider, but made
no specific recommendations.

Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said
Japan plans to announce a package of economic measures
immediately after the 1987/88 budget passes Parliament.
    The passage of the full budget is expected after May 20 as
the government has decided to compile a 50-day stop-gap budget
for the year starting April 1. An opposition boycott over a
proposed sales tax has disrupted parliamentary business.
    Miyazawa told a press conference Prime Minister Yasuhiro
Nakasone is unlikely to take the package to Washington.
    Nakasone hopes to meet President Reagan in late April or
early May to prepare for the Venice economic summit in June.
    Asked if he planned to visit the U.S. To attend monetary
conferences including International Monetary Fund meetings in
early April, Miyazawa said he will make a decision carefully on
the matter, taking into account parliament debate.
    The package is likely to include a record amount of public
works spending in the first 1987/88 half, Miyazawa said.
    Miyazawa said the provisional budget will total about 8,800
billion yen and incorporate a little more than 1,800 billion
for public works. Japan expects the stop-gap budget to help
spur the economy, Miyazawa said.
    Miyazawa said the Government and the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party will seek the passage of the bills related to
the controversial sales tax without any revision.
    Japanese press reports had previously interpretated remarks
by a top government official as indicating a revision of the
tax but the official did not mean that, Miyazawa said.

Britain's gross domestic product (GDP)
on the average basis of output, expenditure and income rose by

Central Statistical Office (CSO) preliminary figures show.
    In the fourth quarter, GDP rose 0.7 pct over the previous
quarter and was up 3.3 pct on the same 1985 quarter.
    The average estimate index, seasonally-adjusted and based
1980, was set at 114.3 in the fourth quarter of 1986 against
113.5 in the previous quarter and 110.7 in the final quarter of
1985.
    The CSO said the average GDP estimate index for 1986 as a
whole was 113.1, up 2.6 pct from 110.2 for 1985.
    On the output measure, GDP rose an upward revised
seasonally adjusted 0.3 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986 to
114.9 on the output index from 114.5 in the previous quarter,
giving a 3.2 pct rise over the fourth 1985 quarter, the CSO
figures show.
    On income-based GDP, the index in the fourth quarter rose
by 0.7 pct from the third quarter and was up 3.8 pct on the
year-ago quarter.
    The indices stood at 115.3, 114.4 and 111.0 respectively.
    Expenditure-based GDP rose 1.2 pct in the fourth quarter of
1986 from the third quarter and was up 2.9 pct from the same
1985 quarter.
    The CSO set the expenditure index at 112.9 from 111.6 in
the third quarter of 1986 and 109.8 in the final 1985 quarter.
    The year-on-year rise for expenditure GDP was 2.3 pct with
the expenditure index for the whole of 1986 set at 111.9
against 109.4 a year earlier.
    For income GDP, the year-on-year rise was 2.6 pct against
against three pct a year earlier. The ouptut GDP measure rose
2.8 pct year-on-year, down from 3.8 pct in 1985.
    The government usually considers the output measure the
most reliable way of measuring short-term GDP changes.
    It is based on output data for production industry and
partial information for the rest of the economy.
    The government had forecast that average measure GDP would
rise 2.5 pct in calendar 1986 after 3.3 pct in 1985. The budget
unveiled on Tuesday foresaw GDP growth in 1987 of three pct.
    The GDP deflator, based on expenditure at market prices,
rose 1.2 pct in the fourth quarter from the third, to give a
2.4 pct rise over fourth quarter 1985. Year-on-year, the
deflator rose 3.7 pct.

by its Stuttgart branch by officials there exceeding their
powers, a bank spokesman said in answer to queries.
    The spokesman declined to say exactly how large the losses
were. Berliner Bank has suspended the three managers of its
Stuttgart branch and is continuing an investigation into the
case, in which state prosecutors are also participating.
    The fact that powers had been exceeded emerged in a routine
check at the branch. The City of West Berlin owns 74 pct of
Berliner Bank and the rest is held by small shareholders.

President Ronald Reagan said he
would veto any tax increases voted by Congress.
    "My pledge to veto any tax rate increase remains rock solid,"
Reagan said during a televised news conference.
     The president said he opposed efforts by some members of
Congress to back away from deficit reduction targets set by the
Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law. He urged passage of a
constitutional amendment to balance the budget.
    "It's time Congress cut the federal budget and left the
family budget alone," Reagan said.
    He said the congressional budget process was in desperate
need of reform and urged passage of an amendment to the U.S.
constitution that would require a balanced federal budget.
    "This yearly deficit feeding process must stop," he added. "We
must act now to pass a constitutional amendment to balance the
budget."
    In the meantime, he said, Congress cannot back away from
the deficit reduction goals set by federal law he said.

President Reagan said the United
States must do more to lessen its reliance on imported oil.
    President Reagan said during a nationally televised news
conference that the rising U.S. reliance on foreign oil is a
problem that the administration is studying.
    "We have to study this more," Reagan said. "This is why we
increased the Strategic (Petroleum) Reserve, but we have to do
more," he said.
    Reagan said his administration has already proposed
deregulating natural gas and eliminating the windfall profits
tax on crude oil production.
    However, he complained that Congress had not yet approved
those measures.
    The Department of Energy earlier this week released a
report that warned of rising U.S. reliance on foreign oil
imports at a time when domestic production is declining. It
suggested options for the administration to consider, but made
no specific recommendations.

The London Commodity Exchange (LCE) and
International Petroleum Exchange (IPE) are to introduce revised
trading slip systems incorporating the time that futures
business is executed, an LCE spokeswoman said.
    The LCE's six week trial system starts on April 1, with
buyers and sellers filling in slips which carry not only the
transaction, but also the date and time of execution.
    These slips will then have to be forwarded to market staff
for entering into International Commodities Clearing House
(ICCH) terminals within 15 minutes of the trade being
transacted, the spokeswoman said.
    The IPE system is similar, although here traders will use

London International Financial Futures Exchange.
    Time-stamping of U.K. Futures business becomes mandatory

Geodome Resources Ltd said
following receipt of a feasibility study from Raytheon Co's

County, Idaho, as quickly as possible.
    The company said the study found proven ore reserves of
3,302,000 short tons grading 0.077 ounce of gold per ton.  It
said the mine will operate at a rate of 626,000 tons of ore per
year, with higher-grade ore being mined in the first three
years for a rapid payback of capital costs.
    The company said the feasibility study calls for gold
production averaging 41,000 ounces a year for the life of the
mine and 50,000 ounces a year over the first three years, with
99,000 ounces of silver per year being produced over the miune
life.
    Capital costs would be 22.3 mln dlrs with all-new equipment
and 500,000 to one mln dlrs less with used equipment, it said. 
It said the mine would be operated by a contract miner but the
associated mill by Geodome.

on filing a rate application with the Public Utilities

Treasury Secretary James Baker said
that over the long-term the tax reform bill and lower marginal
tax rates should increase compliance with the tax law and bring

    In testimony before a senate appropriations subcommittee
Baker said no savings in the Treasury's budgetary requirements
wil be achieved in the short-run by the new tax law.
    "The tax changes occurring in 1987 and 1988 under tax reform
will not directly effect IRS enforcement activities until
financial year 1989 and 1990."
    He told the subcommittee that the Treasury's objective was
to strengthen the capability of the Internal Revenue Service to
promote tax compliance and generate revenue.
    He said they were seeking funds to increase staffing to
reduce the backlog of delinquent tax accounts, reducing pending
tax litigation cases under appeal, and resolving unreported
income cases disclosed through a program that matches third
party documents to returns.
    "This request will continue our effort to build a stronger
and more credible deterrent against non-compliance with tax
laws," he said.
    Baker also told the subcommittee that the administration
would continue the efforts to improve the management of the
government's cash and credit, and its financial information.
     In addition a policy of full reimbursement to Federal

Gulf Canada Corp said a
discharge of material at its Amauligak drilling site in the
Beaufort Sea caused no danger to the environment.
    Yesterday, the federal department of energy charged Gulf
Canada with eight counts of illegal dumping for discharging
powdered cement and drilling mud between September 23 and 30
last year.
    The charges carry a maximum 50,000 dlr fine on each count.
    Gulf said the government's charges relate to discharging
materials without a permit, not to environmental damage
resulting from the action.
    Gulf said it voluntarily informed appropriate government
officials when the material was discharged.
    The company also said none of the material was discharged
within 12 miles of the closest shoreline. It added that one of
the materials cited, barite, is a naturally occurring mineral
routinely discharged into the sea during drilling operations.

Pubco Corp said its board declared a
dividend distribution of one common stock purchase right on
each outstanding share of Pubco's common stock.
    It said each right will entitle shareholders to buy one
share of common stock at an exercise price of three dlrs.
    The rights will be exercisable only if a person or group
acquires 20 pct or more of Pubco's common stock or announces a
tender which would result in ownership by a person or group of
20 pct or more of the common stock, the company said.
    Pubco said it will be entitled to redeem the rights at 0.1
cts per right at any time before a 20 pct position has been
acquired and afterward in certain circumstances. It said the
exercise price will be substantially reduced in the event of an
acquisition of 25 pct or more of common stock.
    If Pubco is acquired in a merger or other transaction, each
right will entitle its holder to purchase, at the right's
then-current exercise price, a number of the acquiring
company's common shares having a market value at that time of
twice the right's exercise price, the company said.
    The dividend distribution will be made March 31, 1987,
payable to shareholders of record on that date. The rights will
expire ten years later on March 31, 1987, the company said.
    Pubco said the rights are not being distributed in response
to any specific effort to change control of Pubco, and the
board is not aware of any such effort.

Treasury Secretary James Baker said
the administration still opposes Senate Banking Committee
legislation that would close a key loophole in federal bankinng
law.
    The loophole has spawned a proliferation of limited service
banks known as non-bank banks that can engage in risky
activities barred to traditional banks.
    Baker has been asked to support the legislation by Banking
Chairman William Proxmire (D-Wisc).
    Proxmire's panel approved closing the loophole in a bill
recapitalizing the thrift insurance fund.
    Baker said the administration supports moving a bill
through Congress that would address only the recapitalization
issue, for fear such "collateral provisions" as the
loophole-closing measure would stall the bill.
    Proxmire later told reporters he backs the committee bill
with or without administration support.
    "I'm going to push it through in any event," he said.
    The administration also opposes the committee bill on
grounds it bars new banking powers.

Morgan Guaranty Ltd, through a special
financing subsidiary, said it is issuing the first repackaging
of perpetual floating rate notes, consisting of a repackaging
of an outstanding WestPac Banking Corp security.
    Trading in perpetual floating rate notes, about 17 billion
dlrs of which are outstanding, has come to a virtual halt as
prices plunged. Because the securities never mature, there is
no way to price them properly unless there is a liquid two-way
market for them.
    Investors have been stuck with billions of dollars of notes
on their books that no one else will buy.
    Under terms of the offer, Morgan said it has set up a
special-purpose financing company, Pacific Securities Co Ltd,
which will issue two separate securities. The unit becomes the
holder of 200 mln dlrs of Westpac floating rate notes.
    Morgan officials declined to disclose the level at which
Pacific  purchased the Westpac securities, although in late
February, they were quoted at 85 against an issue price of par.
    Pacific Securities will issue two instruments. The first is
a floating rate bond due March 29, 2002. The bond pays interest
at 50 basis points over the London Interbank Offered Rate.
    While the initial Westpac issue offered investors only 15
basis points over LIBOR, Morgan Guaranty said WestPac has
agreed with Pacific Securities that it will pay investors the
remaining 35 basis points.
    Also, WestPac has agreed to redeem to floating rate notes
after 15 years.
    The other portion of the security consists of a zero-coupon
bond, also maturing at 2002, for which the investor pays 20
cents on the dollar. Morgan officials said that by 2002, the
effective yield will be a 20 pct return.
    However, Morgan officials said, holders of the zero-coupon
bonds will not be paid in cash when the securities mature.
    Instead, they will be paid in an equivalent amount of
zero-coupon Westpac perpetual floating rate notes.
    As part of the agreement, Pacific Securities has agreed to
place proceeds of the sale of the new securities on deposit at
WestPac and earnings from the deposit will be used to subsidise
the payment of the additional interest to investors.
    Also as part of the issue, there is an option for issuance
of a 70 mln dlr tap to be offered the following year.
    The tap will consist of 70 mln dlrs in floating rate notes
paying and an additional equivalent amount of zero coupon bonds
also at a deep discount of 20 cents on the dollar.
    Fees consist of a one pct selling concession and 0.50 pct
combined underwriting and management.
    Westpac itself has agreed to be co-lead manager of both
tranches and two small syndicates are being formed, Morgan
Guaranty said.

sharply this morning after analyst Daniel Lee of Drexel Burnham

said.
    McDonald's, an operator of fast food restaurants, rose
1-5/8 to 77-3/8.
    "Comparable store sales are up 5.6 pct in 1986 vs 1985,"
Lee said, "and the stock is trading below the market multiple."
He said "not many companies have a consistent 15 pct annual
earnings growth rate, return on equity above 20 pct, but trade
at less than the market multiple."
    Analyst Lee said "the introduction of a new line of salads
this spring, at about the time we are all trying to squeeze
into bathing suits, should boost sales."
    He also noted that "the average McDonald's does about 1.369
mln dlrs in revenues a year. That compares with 1.1 mln dlrs a
year for the average Burger King and 800,000 dlrs a year for
the average Wendy's." Since it cost about the same to build a
single store for any one of these chains, he said, "McDonald's
can well justify their expansion."
    Lee expects McDonald's to earn 4.40 dlrs a share in 1986
and 5.15 dlrs in 1988. Last year it earned 3.72 dlrs a share.

distillate oil or natural gas, GE said, the program will look
at the feasability of powering a turbine with coal/water slurry
-- a mixture of water and finely ground coal particles from
which most of the ash has been removed.
    Besides using a cheaper fuel, the company said, such a
system would also be less expensive to build than conventional
coal plants which require a boiler in which coal heats water to
make steam to drive a turbine or a coal gasifier which converts
to coal into gas, which is then burned to power a turbine.

First City Bancorporation's sale of 54
mln dlrs in oil loans to Prudential-Bache should significantly
reduce its energy problems, but the bank's losses are still
virtually guaranteed to continue, analysts said.
    The package of energy loans was sold at book value, so
First City did not to show a gain or loss, said bank spokesman
James Day. He added it was possible First City would sell more
of the bank's remaining 1.4 billion dlrs in oil-related loans
to raise cash.
    The loans had been made by First City to oil producers and
to oilfield service and supply companies. Day said some had
already been classified as nonperforming, or charged off as a
loss, but he could not identify how many were included in those
categories.
    The loans were purchased by Prudential Bache's Energy
Growth Fund, a limited partnership created last month with 90
mln dlrs in funding to invest in oil and gas properties.
    First City, the big Texas bank hit hardest by the downturn
in oil prices, lost a record 402 mln dlrs in fiscal year 1986
and has said it is seeking a merger partner or some other
capital assistance. The Houston-based bank's nonperforming
assets totaled 897.1 mln dlrs at yearend, up from 563.1 mln
dlrs at the end of 1985
    Analysts have said no buyer is likely to be interested in
the troubled bank unless government assistance is available.
    "Their problems are not just limited to energy. They have a
substantial portfolio in real estate. This sale in and of
itself won't make the company look better to a potential
buyer," said Ray Archibold, a banking analyst with McCarthy,
Crisanti and Maffei Inc.
    "It does reduce the bank's exposure in energy loans and 54
mln dlrs is a substantial amount," Archibold said, "but the
deal represents only about four pct of their energy loans."
    Of First City's total loan portfolio of 9.9 mln dlrs, about
14 pct or 1.4 billion dlrs were made to energy producers or
suppliers, analysts said. Its record losses have been caused by
its past status as one of the nation's top lenders to oil and
gas producers and suppliers during the boom days of the late
1970s and early 1980s.
    First City said about half of the loans sold to Prudential
came from its Energy Finance Co., an entity formed in 1982 to
loan money to "more venturesome" oil borrowers that promised a
higher potential return. The other half of the loans were from
First City's lead bank in Houston.
    Chris Kotowski, an analyst with Oppenheimer and Co., said
the sale of the package of energy loans was the first
encouraging news from First City in months.
    "It's not going to solve all of First City's problems but
it's a good transaction for them. It may be possible for them
to sell additional loans," Kotowski said. "Prudential can fund
these things more cheaply than First City and there's an
incentive to invest in troubled energy companies right now as
values are depressed"
    In a statement, First City chairman J.A. Elkins said the
bank's strategy was to reduce the proportion of energy loans to
total loans. "This move, which we believe is the first
transaction of its kind, helps us further, and we were able to
make it without suffering a loss."

has filed suit against <Dixons Group PLC>, Cyclops Corp,

    The company said the suit, filed in U.S. District Court for

order and preliminary injunction requiring Dixons, for 10
business days, to permit any Cyclops shareholder who previously
tendered and now wishes to withdraw to do so.
    The company said the order and injunction would also

Cyclops to immediately provide to all potential bidders for
Cyclops all information given to Dixons.

The Food and Drug Administration has
approved Burroughs Wellcome Co's AZT as a treatment to help
certain AIDS patients, including those with advanced-AIDS
related complex.
    The drug is the first approved treatment for AIDS in the
U.S. AZT or azidothymidine will be marketed as Retrovir by the
company, the U.S. arm of Britain's <Wellcome PLC>.
    Because of its limited supply, the FDA said the drug will
be restricted initially to those patients with AIDS or
AIDS-related complex with severely depressed immunity or a
history of Pnumocystis carinii, pneumonia.
    "Today's approval marks an important step but by no means a
final victory against our ongoing war against AIDS," said Dr
Robert E. Windom, assistant secretary for health at the Public
Health Service.
    He noted that available clinical data were sufficient for
approving the use of Retrovir only for certain indications and
not for all AIDS associated conditions.
    Nevertheless, Windom said today's action means that
significant medical relief will be available to thousands of
those afflicted with the disease.
    "Retrovir is not a cure but it has demonstrated ability to
improve the short-term survival of AIDS patients with recently
diagnosed PCP (Pneumomystis carinii pneumonia) and certain
patients with advanced ARC (AIDS-related complex)," said
Windom.
    Advanced AIDS related complex is a condition that
frequently precedes and develops within a short time into
full-scale acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
    As of March 16, there were 32,825 AIDS cases reported
nationwide, with more than 16,000 deaths.
    The Public Health Agency said advanced ARC patients have
symptoms that include weight loss, persistent fever and
diarrhea, and less severe infections such as oral thrush and
herpes infections.
    The federal agency said that AIDS patients who are expected
to qualify for retrovir treatment are those who have serious
opportunistic infections associated with AIDS and those with
advanced AIDS related complex.
    It is estimated that about two to three times as many
Americans may suffer from advanced ARC as from AIDS.
    Burroughs Wellcome, of Research Triangle Park, N.C., has
scheduled a press conference for Monday in New York where it
will discuss what patients will quality for treatment. The
company has said that a year's treatment with the drug would
cost 8,000 dlrs to 10,000 dlrs.
    Burroughs has also said that it has adequate supplies of
the drug for the most seriously ill patients, and will have
supplies for a minimum of 30,000 patients and probably more by
the end of the year.
    Retrovir's approval was expected as a panel of expert
medical advisers to the FDA recommended in January that the
drug be licensed for sale even though there were gaps in
understanding the drug's effectiveness.
    The panel said the drug could prolong the lives of certain
AIDS patients but it also caused severe side effects such as
anemia and other blood problems.
    Due to the extraordinary situation surrounding AIDS, a
fatal disease reaching what some health officials say is
epidemic proportions, Windom said the FDA has moved in near
record time--four months--to approve the drug.
    AZT, derived from herring sperm, was created in the 1960s
by Jerome P. Horwitz of the Michigan Cancer Foundation as an
anticancer agent.
    Meanwhile in London, dealers said Wellcome shares rose to
497p in response, up from last night's close of 457p.
    But pharmaceutical analyst Mark Clark of Barclays de Zoete
Wedd said the new drug's share of the market may not be as a
high as expected since it had very severe side effects.
    "It is not a cure and the side effects are so bad it is
unlikely that someone could support a full year's treatment," he
said. "There are also a whole host of other drugs likely to come
onto the market quite soon."
    Last week the drug was approved for marketing in the U.K.

    Kurt Dew, president of Risk Analysis Systems, said the idea
was on the drawing board at the staff level and not near
realization.
    Dew said the contracts would be logical successors to two
contracts already proposed by the exchange -- futures on
interest rate swaps and on Treasury repurchase agreements, or
repos.
    Regulations recently proposed by federal bank regulators
could enhance the attractiveness of futures contracts on
currency swaps, he said.
    Those regulations would require banks to allocate a certain
share of its capital to currency swaps, Dew said. Futures on
currency swaps would not require capital allocation.
    A futures market in Government National Mortgage
Association (Ginnie Mae) repos would help investors outside the
circle of primary dealers get the best possible price, Dew
said.
    Dew emphasized that the COMEX board had not yet considered
the contracts.

West Germany's money supply growth
slowed in February after January's sharp rise but the trend is
still definitely upward, the Bundesbank said in a statement.
    Growth in the traditionally broad M3 aggregate was only
moderate in February. While cash in circulation, deposits with
statutory withdrawal notice and sight deposits grew sharply,
short-term time deposits fell after expanding unusually
strongly in January.
    In the six months to February, M3, which excludes holdings
of German non-banks abroad, grew at a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 8.5 pct after 9.8 in the six months to January.
    Compared with February 1986, M3 rose 7-1/2 pct.
    In the six months to February, M2, which excludes time
deposits with statutory withdrawal notice, rose at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 8.8 pct and M1, which consists of cash
and sight deposits, rose seven pct.
    International transactions of non-banks again led to a
significant inflow of funds, the Bundesbank said.
    Net claims of commercial banks and the Bundesbank against
foreigners, refecting these foreign payments, increased by 9.1
billion marks in February, little changed from January's rise.
    But in contrast to January, the dampening effect of the
inflow on domestic credit demand outweighed the expansionary
effect on money growth, the Bundesbank said.
    Outstanding bank credits to companies and private
individuals remained virtually unchanged in February.
    A sharp drop in short-term company credits, which reflected
the foreign funds inflow, was balanced by a moderate rise in
long-term credits and a sharp rise in credits for securities.
    At the end of February total bank credits to the private
sector were 4-1/2 pct above the February 1986 level.
    The effect of public authority cash movements on the money
supply was slightly expansive, the Bundesbank said.
    Although banks acquired large amounts of public authority
paper, public authorities drew down book credits at commercial
banks and the Bundesbank.
    Capital formation strengthened in February and slowed money
supply growth to a larger extent than in January.
    A total of 7.7 billion marks in long-term funds was placed
with banks after 6.6 billion the previous month.

<Houston Metals Corp> said the

drilling and bulk sampling program at its Silver Queen Mine has
yielded positive results.
    Houston said representative assays from the 2,750 ft and
2,600 ft levels at the south end of the mine established ore
deposits in the following ranges: copper, 3.7 pct to 5.08 pct,
lead .99 pct to 1.5 pct, zinc six pct to 9.6 pct, silver 15.63
pct to 79.92 oz per ton, gold .062 to .19 oz per ton, germanium
93 to 103 grams per ton, gallium five to 18 grams per ton.
    In addition, Houston Metals said the weighted average of 25
diamond-drilled holes 375 ft below the 2,600 foot level and 800
ft along the strike assayed gold at .237 oz per ton, silver at
10.91 oz per ton and zinc at 8.99 pct.
    An apparent parallel vein structure at the 2,600 ft level
returned similar values, the company said.
    It added that preliminary metallurgical tests from
representative bulk ore samples indicate the commercial
feasability of producing a zinc and a copper-lead concentrate.
    Houston Metals said gold, silver and the base metals have
recoveries of 90 pct to 95 pct, with 95 pct of gold recovered
from better gold ores, while gallium, germanium and indium have
recoveries of between 66 pct to 82 pct and are included in the
zinc concentrate.

British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
came under fresh pressure for an early election today as
financial indicators bolstered the government's forecasts of a
boom in the economy following the budget earlier this week.
    Two of the country's leading lending institutions announced
cuts in home loans rates following Wednesday's cut in interest
rates by the main banks by half a point to 10 per cent.
    Analysts said today's reduction by Abbey National from
12.75 pct to 11.25, and one by the Halifax Building Society
from 12.25 to 11.25 in lending rates for house buyers would be
followed by other main institutions.
   One financial analyst commented: "I imagine the Abbey
National is being toasted in Downing Street (the prime
minister's residence) but not in the boardrooms of other big
societies."
    Coupled with income tax cuts announced by Chancellor of the
Exchequer (Finance Minister) Nigel Lawson in his budget last
Tuesday as well as recent opinion polls showing Thatcher's
rightwing Conservative Party well ahead of Labour and the
centrist Alliance, they said pressure was now building up on
Thatcher to call a general election as early as June.
    Yesterday there was more good news for Thatcher in the form
of a continuing drop in the number of unemployed, with
government minister predicting that it would fall below the
three million mark before long.

The Agriculture Department is not
considering any major changes in its pricing system for posted
county prices, an Agriculture Department offical said.
    "We do not have current plans to make any major adjustments
or changes in our pricing," said Bob Sindt, USDA assistant
deputy administrator for commodity operations.
    U.S. grain traders and merchandisers said earlier this week
USDA might act soon to reduce the cash corn price premium at
the Gulf versus interior price levels by dropping ASCS posted
prices to encourage interior PIK and roll movement.
    But Sindt denied USDA is planning any such changes.
    "If people are suggesting that we are going to make
wholesale changes in pricing, we are not considering this," he
said.
    Sindt, however, did not rule out the possiblity of
implementing more minor changes in its pricing system.
    "We are continually monitoring the whole nationwide
structure to maintain its accuracy," he said. "If we become
convinced that we need to make a change, then appropriate
adjustments will be made."
    Sindt acknowledged that concern has been voiced that USDA's
price differentials between the New Orleans Gulf and interior
markets are not accurate because of higher than normal barge
freight rates.
    He said commodity operations deputy administrator Ralph
Klopfenstein is currently in the midwest on a speaking tour and
will meet with ASCS oficials in Kansas City next week.
    Sindt said a number of issues will be discussed at that
meeting, including the current concern over the gulf corn
premiums.
    He defended the USDA differentials, saying that these price
margins reflect an average of prices throughout the year and
that seasonal factors will normally cause prices to increase or
decrease.
    The USDA official also said that only those counties that
use the Gulf to price grain are being currently affected by the
high barge freight tariffs and increased gulf prices.
    When asked if the USDA emergency storage program which
allows grain to be stored in barges was taking up barge space
and accounting for the higher freight rates, Sindt discounted
the idea.
    He said USDA has grain left in only about 250 barges and
that, under provisions of the program, these all have to be
emptied by the end of March.

A panel of four leading economists
told a congressional hearing today that foreign economies will
need to expand to avoid recession as the U.S. trade deficit
declines.
    C. Fred Bergsten, a former senior Treasury Department
official, and Robert Solomon of the Brookings Institution told
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the major exporting
countries risk recession if they do not expand because U.S.
demand for imports is expected to fall.
    "They need to beef up domestic demand as their trade
surplus falls," or unemployment will keep growing, Bergsten
said.
    Bergsten predicted the U.S. trade deficit, which hit 169
billion dlrs last year, will fall 30-40 billion dlrs a year for
the next two years as a result of the dollar's 35-40 pct
decline since September 1985.
    The government should intervene to push the dollar down
further if the previous declines do not lead to an improvement
in the trade picture, if the U.S. budget deficit is not reduced
and if foreign expansion does not occur, he added.
    Solomon said the dollar must fall further to compensate for
the huge interest payments required on U.S. foreign debt. The
Paris agreement between the major industrialized countries
provided only for a pause in its decline, he said.
    Rimmer de Vries, senior vice president of Morgan Guaranty
Trust Co., said the U.S. trade deficit problem is a problem of
lagging growth in industrial economies, prolonged currency
misalignment, debt problems of the developing countries, and
unbalanced growth in the Asian industrializing countries.
    John Makin of the American Enterprise Institute, suggested
foreign tax cuts to increase demand and pick up the slack from
the U.S. trade deficit fall.

Morgan Guaranty Ltd's novel and complex
repackaging of Westpac Banking Corp's perpetual floating rate
note (FRN) may attract some investors, but is unlikely to aid
current holders of the Westpac securities or the FRN market,
FRN traders said.
    "It actually does nothing for anyone who has been stuffed
and right now, that's the problem," said a trader at one U.K.
Clearing bank that has also issued its own perpetuals.
    Trading in perpetual issues, which pay interest but never
mature, has come to a virtual halt. Prices have fallen so far
that only about five firms still make markets in them.
    The Westpac perpetual notes are technically now the
property of a newly formed single-purpose finance subsidiary,
Pacific Securities. If Morgan tried to find a home for the
actual Westpac notes, as is, they would be paid no more than 85
cents on the dollar, at most, traders said.
    But the repackaging allows them to target a new class of
investor for the notes and take the old issues off their books
without registering a loss, the traders said.
    "The only one the repackaging favours is Morgan," a trader
said.
    Meanwhile, the end-holders of perpetual notes, most of whom
are Japanese banks, must still find a way to value them by
year-end, now a week away.
    From Morgan's point of view, the repackaging does aid the
present holders of the notes as well as offering value to a new
class of investors.
    "At least we've put a floor under the price of the notes.
We've created a way to set a real value for them," one Morgan
official said. Morgan had earlier attempted, but abandoned,
another plan to repackage the Westpac securities.
    Morgan's holdings of Westpac paper create special problems
for it because of the way U.S. Regulators view bank holdings of
the primary capital of other banks, traders said. Therefore, it
is crucial that a vehicle for selling the paper be found.
    And indeed, note traders said, the FRN portion of the
repackaged securities -- which Westpac has offered to redeem
for cash in 15 years -- does have real value.
    For one thing, traders noted, it pays about the highest
rate over the London Interbank Offered Rate of virtually any
newly issued security. The spread is 50 basis points.
    However, the other portion of the security, in which the
investor pays 20 cents on the dollar for a zero coupon 15-year
bond, is of dubious value unless the Westpac perpetual assumes
a market value near par 15 years from now, traders said.
    The zero-coupon portion could provide value for an account
which for tax purposes, wants to take a large capital loss, the
traders said. In the 15-year period between the time the note
is purchased and the time it is redeemed, no interest is paid.
    When repayment finally occurs, it is not in cash like an
ordinary zero-coupon bond. Instead, the investor receives one
of the Westpac perpetual floaters.

from 51-pct-owned liquor producer Hiram Walker-Gooderham and

said the company will record higher earnings in the first
quarter and for the full year.
    Addressing analysts, Tsai said "First quarter results have
been extremely encouraging and results for all of 1987 will
show significant improvement over 1986."
    American Can earned 196.3 mln dlrs, or 3.21 dlrs per share,
adjusted for a two-for-one stock split, in 1986.
    In the 1986 first quarter, the company reported net income

or 2.30 dlrs per share, before the stock adjustment.
    In the 1987 first quarter, American Can will record a
one-time gain of 28 cts per share from the sale of shares in
its Musicland Group subsidiary. The gain is slightly higher
than the expected gain the company predicted in February
because additional shares of the unit were sold.
    In response to a question, Tsai said American Can's
investment in Jefferies and Co is "very small".
    "We treat it as just another passive investment," he said.
According to press reports, American Can owns 20 pct of
Jefferies and is its largest single shareholder.

said he would plead guilty to two felony charges for breaking

    He told a meeting of securities analysts that, although the
company is not yet at point in its cost-cutting drive to
improve profit margins, it is "on the right track."
    Olson said ATT's cash flow was "very strong in the first
two months of the year, better than budgeted."
    While Olson does not know if the company's earnings and
revenues will improve by yearend, he said ATT is "moving in the
proper direction."
    For 1986, ATT's earnings dropped to 139 mln dlrs, or five
cts a share, on revenues of 34.1 billion dlrs, from 1.56
billion dlrs, or 1.37 dlrs a share, on revenues of 34.4 billion
dlrs in 1985.
    During 1986 ATT took 3.2 billion dlrs in charges from
expenses related to reducing its work force by 32,000.

<Hudson's Bay Co> said a writeoff of
40.4 mln dlrs, or 1.39 dlrs per share, that it took in 1986 was
mainly due to its investment in Dome Petroleum Ltd <DMP>.
     The company reported an operating profit of 33.0 mln dlrs,
or 32 cts per share, for fiscal 1986, compared to an operating
loss of 9,055,000 dlrs, or 1.23 dlrs per share, in the previous
year.
     Hudson's Bay holds about four mln shares of Dome's 10 pct
series one cumulative subordinate convertible preferred shares.
    Last March, Dome suspended payment of dividends on all
preferred shares until June 1, 1987. The shares give the holder
the right to convert to Dome common shares at 3.33 dlrs per
share.
    Dome has the right to force conversion if Dome common
reaches 3.885 dlrs per share. Dome is trading at 1.12 dlrs per
share, down one ct, today on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
    Hudson's Bay also said it had an increase in 1986 in retail
operating profit to 185.3 mln dlrs from 111.4 mln dlrs, but
that was partially offset by an increase of 14.9 mln dlrs in
interest costs and 25.3 mln dlrs in taxes.
     Hudson's Bay also said its Markborough properties
subsidiary had an operating profit of 108.6 mln dlrs, up from
98.8 mln dlrs the year before.
    Profit from non-Markborough real estate was 23.5 mln dlrs
in 1986, down from 27.6 mln dlrs a year ago.
    Operating profit from natural resources was 4.2 mln dlrs,
up 1.2 mln dlrs from the prior year. Pensions costs were
reduced by 34.9 mln dlrs due to an accounting change. Total
debt declined during the year by 251 mln dlrs to 2.28 billion
dlrs and debt to equity ratio improved to 1.8 to one from 2.1
to one.

<Allied-Lyons PLC> will report
substantial growth in the second half of fiscal 1987 ended
March 7, chairman Derrick Holden-Brown said in answer to
reporters' queries.
    "You will certainly see substantial growth in Allied-Lyons
in the second half," Holden-Brown said following a presentation
to Toronto securities analysts.
    Holden-Brown declined to say whether second half growth in
profit before taxes would exceed the 20.7 pct rise reported in
the first half. Allied-Lyons had first half profit of 148.0 mln
stg, up from 122.6 mln stg in the prior year.
    Allied-Lyons will also have a full year extraordinary cost
of slightly more than seven mln stg for defence costs
associated with Elders IXL Ltd's failed take-over bid for the
company, Holden-Brown also said.
    But that cost will be more than offset by an extraordinary
gain of about 60 mln stg on Allied-Lyons' sale of its 24.9 pct
interest in Australian brewers Castlemaine Toohey, he said.
    "So with Australians, you win some and you lose some. But
hopefully you win them all in the end," Holden-Brown said.
    Asked if he thought Allied-Lyons is vulnerable to other
take-over attempts, Holden-Brown replied: "No, I don't."
    "We must never be complacent and we must always be very
watchful, but I think we would be very expensive," he said.
    Holden-Brown said Allied-Lyons' share price to corporate
earnings ratio is now comparable with other leading companies
in the food and beverage industry.
    "That was not the case two years ago. If the Australians had
come a little bit earlier, they might have had more luck, I
think," Holden-Brown said.
    Holden-Brown said Allied-Lyons' move to acquire Hiram
Walker-Gooderham and Worts Ltd in March, 1986 during Elders
take-over bid for the company was "100 pct a growth action."
    "We knew when we did it that it could be misconstrued, and
that people almost inevitably would say (the acquisition was)
defensive, but it never was," Holden-Brown told reporters.
    Asked by securities analysts if Allied-Lyons plans a share
issue in Canada after acquiring a 51 pct interest in Hiram
Walker, Holden-Brown responded: "Plan might be too strong a
word. But I must say I do feel the need for Allied-Lyons to be
better known in Canada."

American Express Co said it was
subpoenaed by the Securities and Exchange Commission in
connection with documents on transactions in securities of
American Express and its former unit, Fireman's Fund.
    American Express said its brokerage unit, Shearson Lehman
Brothers Inc was also served with a subpoena. Shearson acted as
co-manager in the underwriting of units of Fireman's common
stock and warrants last May, was also served with a subpoena,
it said.
    American Express said the subpoena to Shearson relates to
transactions with Jefferies and Co and others.
    American Express said it and Shearson intend to comply with
all requests from the SEC and to cooperate fully. American
Express said neither company is aware of any unlawful conduct
with respect to the matters and a thorough investigation is
continuing.
    American Express said the subpoenas were received
yesterday, and that it and Shearson were unaware of any inquiry
prior to receiving the subpoenas.
    Yesterday, Boyd Jefferies, founder of Jefferies Group, said
he agreed to plead guilty to two felony counts of securities
violations.
    Jefferies also settled charges with the Securities and
Exchange Commission of market manipulation and another scheme
with Ivan Boesky, who has settled SEC charges of insider
trading.
    Jefferies' firm was censured by the SEC and ordered to
retain an outside consultant to review its procedures.
    In documents filed on Jefferies yesterday, the SEC did not
identify who was involved in the market manipulation scheme
aside from Jefferies. It said "a certain issuer," which held
controlling interest in a second public company, offered
several mln shares of the company's common stock to the public
in a secondary offering during 1986.
    The SEC alleged that Boyd Jefferies carried out a scheme
with an unidentified person to drive up the price of the second
company's stock prior to the offering by having the Jefferies
firm trade in the stock.
    Jefferies and co was allegedly compensated for the loss
from those trading activities after sending a fake invoice to
another unnamed person, the government charged.
    American Express first offered Fireman's Fund Corp's stock
to the public in 1985. It lowered its holding from 100 pct to
41 pct. In May, 1986, it reduced its ownership interest to 27
pct by completing a public offering of nine mln units.
    Each unit consisted of one share of common and one warrant
to buy Fireman's fund. The warrants are exercisable from the
issue date through March, 1989.
    At the same time, American Express sold warrants directly
to Fireman's Fund to purchase five mln shares. Those warrants
are exercisable between November, 1988 and March 1991.
    American Express said if all warrants were exercised it
would own about 13 pct of Fireman's fund.
    American Express stock fell 1-1/2, to 77-1/4 on volume of
1.9 mln shares. The stock had been strong in the last two days,
first on rumors, then an announcement of an understanding
American Express reached to sell Nippon Life Insurance Co 13
pct of Shearson.
    Wall Street has also been anticipating American Express
will sell a stake in the brokerage unit to the public as well.
    E.F. Hutton analyst Michael Lewis said he does not believe
the subpoenas will affect Nippon's deal with American Express,
but it could result in a delay of the public offering
anticipated for Shearson.

    "If they're forced to keep a bigger percentage of Shearson
a little longer...big deal. They're certainly not going to
throw Shearson away. Shearson is still an attractive asset," he
said.
    American Express has not commented on speculation it would
offer part of Shearson to the public, but it has said it was
continuing to review options for the brokerage.
    Analysts had speculated an offering of a part of Shearson
would be forthcoming shortly.
    "It puts a cloud over it for a while...The market is
anxious to see them consumate whatever they were going to
consumate," Lewis said.

Bally Manufacturing Corp's proposed
public offering of 24 pct of its Health and Tennis Corp unit is
seen as the first step towards the sale of the entire unit,
analysts said.
    "In the longer-term horizon, Bally wants to concentrate on
its gaming businesses," said analyst Dennis Forst of Seidler
Amdec Securities Inc.
    Last week, Bally said it was considering the sale of
another non-casino unit, its Six Flags amusement park unit,
which analysts said could fetch about 300 mln dlrs.
    Bally spokesman Bill Peltier said "the company currently
has no hard plans to the sell any more of the health club
company, but in the long term we'll wait and see how the
offering goes."
    Once Bally's biggest revenue producer, the health club unit
had 1986 operating income of 60 mln dlrs on revenues of 456.2
mln dlrs, 28 pct of Bally's revenues. Analysts estimate the
unit could be sold for for 300-500 mln dlrs.
    Analysts said Bally's decision to offer shares in the unit
could be the first step to selling it.
    "It would seem obvious that an offering would decrease the
health club unit's debt, increase its cash flow and operating
income, making it an attractive buy to a third party," Steven
Eisenberg of Bear Stearns said.
    On Monday, Bally said it filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission for an initial offering of 24 pct, or 5.8
mln shares, of the unit's common stock at 13-15 dlrs a share.
   About half the proceeds, 40 mln dlrs, will be used to reduce
parent Bally Manufacturing's debt which has swelled to 1.6
billion dlrs due to recent hotel acquisitions and the purchase
of shares from Donald Trump who had threatened a hostile
takeover, according to Bally treasurer Paul Johnson.
    Remaining proceeds from the stock offering and from a
separate offering of 50 mln dlrs of 20-year convertible
subordinated debt would be used to repay about 75 mln dlrs of
short term senior bank debt of the health chain unit, a Bally
spokesperson said.
    Analysts said Bally's health club unit's profits have
remained strong, but are skeptical about the industry's long
range prospects.
    "The fitness club industry, over the last 10 years, has
grown tremendously, but the question is whether its a fad or a
permanent part of our lifestyle," said Eisenberg of Bear
Stearns.
    Analysts said fitness clubs will likely flourish if the
public stays at its peak of health consciousness, but that
overcapacity is likely to occur as consumer enthusiasm wanes.
     In addition, "the returns in the fitness club industry are
just not as high as they are in the gaming industry," said one
analyst.
     There are about 6,500 fitness clubs in the U.S., excluding
clubs run by not-for-profit organizations, according to the
Association of Physical Fitness Centers who estimates it to be
an 8.0-billion-dlr-a-year industry.
     Asked if anyone has offered to buy the unit, which is the
nation's largest health club chain, Peltier said, "no one has
the money to offer to buy it."
    "The fitness industry is a fragmented industry with no
leader and there is a great opportunity for growth through
acquisition and then standardization," said Wayne LaChapelle,
chief financial officer of Livingwell INc <WELL>, the nation's
second largest fitness chain operator whih
    LaChapelle said Livingwell is always interested in
acquisition opportunities but "could not afford an acquisition
the size of Bally at this time."

A financial newsletter which reported
last November that car maker Volkswagen AG <VOWG.F> lost large
sums in currency transactions alleged that unnamed banks had
circumvented banking regulations with help from VW's foreign
exchange department.
    VW had no immediate comment and there was nothing in the
report by the newsletter, the Platow Brief, to link its new
allegations with a suspected currency swindle at VW which is
now being investigated by a prosecutor.
    VW said this month that it had had to make provision for
possible losses up to 480 mln marks in the possible currency
fraud.
    A spokesman for the Federal Banking Supervisory Office in
West Berlin said the office was aware that the newsletter had
made the new allegations and would follow this with interest.
    Platow Brief said around 16 mainly foreign banks based in
West Germany had "parked" excess open positions in currency
trading with VW's foreign exchange department.
    Under West German banking law, banks may not end a trading
day with open positions totalling more than 30 pct of their
capital. During the day banks buy and sell currencies, usually
aiming to match up all deals by the end and balance their
books.
    Some traders who take a view on how currencies will move
may prefer to leave certain positions open, a speculative
situation that the German regulations are designed to limit.
    According to Platow Brief, some traders apparently were
getting round the regulation by getting VW to buy or sell
currencies and hold them temporarily so that their books were
squared. Up to 100 mln dlrs was sometimes involved.
    Non-bank corporations are not covered by the restrictions,
imposed after a bank crash in 1974 to protect bank depositors.
    Breaches of the Banking Law in this way can be punished by
a fine for the dealers involved, and in extreme cases by
removal of the managers, if their active involvement is proved.
    But the Federal Banking Supervisory Office said it first
had to be established how far, if at all, regulations were
breached.
    The suspected VW currency swindle meanwhile involved
operations to protect the company against fluctuations in the
value of the dollar, VW spoksmen have said.
    Some operations to hedge against changes in currency values
were not completed, meaning VW stood to lose money.
    A senior executive has been fired and several other people
suspended, while a prosecutor is looking into the matter.

ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc  has
about 500 mln dlrs in cash and another 1.50 billion dlrs in
available credit, which it intends to use to buy a
pharmaceutical company, Chairman Milan Panic said.
    At the company's annual meeting, he said an acquisition
could take place in the next 24 months.
    "The company has nearly two billion dlrs available for
acquisition today," Panic said, adding, "We are investigating a
number of companies." One company being studied could possibly
be acquired on a friendly basis, he said.
    Panic also said he intends to seek board approval today to
repurchase up to three mln ICN common shares.
    Discussing the possibility of an acquisition, Panic said
the such a purchase is necessary because ICN's current
marketing capability would not be sufficient to support
distribution of the company's products, given ICN's
expectations for market growth worldwide.
    ICN's principal product is ribavirin, also known as
Virazole. The drug is marketed in a number of countries and
described as a broad-based anti-viral.
    The company has said its possible applications include
treatment of some types of hepatitis, herpes, influenza,
childhood diseases and hemorrhagic fevers.
    ICN has been the focus of consirable investor attention in
recent months because of Virazole, which has undergone clinical
trials as a possible treatment of some AIDS-related diseases.
    Panic said today he would not discuss the drug with regard
to AIDS until the Food and Drug Administration completes its
review of data submitted by the company.
    He said an investigation of the drug being conducted by a
House Subcommittee is continuing.
    The subcommittee and the FDA have acknowledged they are

ICN witheld data from the FDA on adverse reactions to the drug.

form as a treatment for an infection that strikes infants,
called respiratory syncytial virus.

The all-party House of Commons Finance
Committee has unanimously called for a "substantial" cut in
credit card interest rates charged by banks and other financial
institutions.
    In a report, the committee recommended that if action is
not taken soon, the government should investigate whether there
is "anti-competitive behaviour" among the banks.
    Minister of State for Finance Tom Hockin told the Commons
prior to the release of the report he favored a cut in the
rates and promised to act quickly on its recommendations.
    The committee said interest rates should be lowered to no
more than the 15.9 pct per annum level announced recently by
the Toronto Dominion Bank.
    Rates on other bank cards range from 18 to 21 pct and to 24
to 28 pct on gasoline and department store cards.
    At a news conference, committee members said they would
call for a legislated rate ceiling if the banks do not take
action quickly.
    "I would be unhappy if they didn't make an announcement
next week," said Committee Chairman Don Blenkarn, also a member
of the ruling Progressive Conservative Party.
    New Democratic Party member Michael Cassidy said, "I hope
the banks see the writing on the wall and take appropriate
action."
    The group did recommend legislation be enacted to ensure a
uniform method of calculating interest on unpaid balances and
that a grace period be allowed for new purchases.

Total food aid needs in 69 of the
least developed countries declined in 1986/87, as requirments
fell in many countries in Africa, the Middle East and Asia, the
U.S. Agriculture Department said.
    In a summary of its World Agriculture Report, the
department said grain production in sub-Saharan Africa was a
record high in 1986, with gains in almost every country.
    However, food needs in Central America rose, worsened by
drought-reduced crops and civil strife.
    Record wheat production in 1986/87 is pushing global wheat
consumption for food to a new high, and higher yielding
varieties have been particularly effective where spring wheat
is a common crop, it said.
    However, may developing countries in tropical climates,
such as Sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, and Central
America, are not well adapted for wheat production, and
improved varieties are not the answer to rising food needs, the
department said.
    World per capita consumption of vegetable oil will rise in
1986/87 for the third straight year.
    Soybean oil constitutes almost 30 pct of vegetable oil
consumption, while palm oil is the most traded, the department

The U.S. Agriculture Department 
formally transmitted to Congress a long-awaited proposal to
drastically slash the sugar loan rate and compensate growers
for the cut with targeted income payments.
    In a letter to the Congressional leadership accompanying
the "Sugar Program Improvements Act of 1987", Peter Myers,
Deputy Agriculture Secretary, said the Reagan administration
wants the sugar loan rate cut to 12 cents per pound beginning
with the 1987 crop, down from 18 cts now.
    Sugarcane and beet growers would be compensated by the
government for the price support cut with targeted income
payments over the four years 1988 to 1991. The payments would
cost an estimated 1.1 billion dlrs, Myers said.
    The administration sugar proposal is expected to be
introduced in the House of Representatives next week by Rep.
John Porter, R-Ill.
    Congressional sources said the program cut is so drastic it
is unlikely to be adopted in either the House or Senate because
politically-influential sugar and corn growers
and high fructose corn syrup producers will strongly resist.
    The direct payment plan outlined by the administration 
targets subsidies to small cane and beet growers and gradually
lowers payments over four years. It also excludes from payment
any output exceeding 20,000 short tons raw sugar per grower.
    For example, on the first 350 tons of production, a grower
would receive 6 cts per lb in fiscal 1988, 4.5 cts in 1989, 3
cts in 1990 and 1.5 cts in 1991.
    The income payments would be based on the amount of
commercially recoverable sugar produced by a farmer in the 1985
or 1986 crop years, whichever is less, USDA said.
    Myers said the administration is proposing drastic changes
in the sugar program because the current high price support is
causing adverse trends in the sugar industry.
    He said the current program has artificially stimulated
domestic sugar and corn sweetener production which has allowed
corn sweeteners to make market inroads.
    U.S. sugar consumption has declined which has resulted in a
"progressive contraction" of the sugar import quota to only one
mln short tons this year, he said. This has hurt cane sugar
refiners who rely on imported sugar processing.
    Furthermore, USDA said the current sugar program gives
overseas manufacturers of sugar-containing products a
competitive advantage. The result has been higher imports of
sugar-containing products and a flight of U.S. processing
facilities overseas to take advantage of cheaper sugar.
    USDA also said the current program imposes a heavy cost on
U.S. consumers and industrial users. In fiscal 1987, USDA said
consumers are paying nearly two billion dlrs more than
necessary for sugar.
    "Enactment of this bill will reduce the price gap between
sweeteners and help to correct or stabilize the many adverse
impacts and trends which the sugar industry is currently
facing," Myers said.
    The following table lists the rate of payments, in cts per
lb, to growers and the quantity covered, in short tons
recoverable raw sugar, under the administration's proposal to
compensate sugar growers with targeted payments.

The USDA monthly cold storage report
for meats is expected to have little, if any, effect on
livestock and meat futures at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
Monday and daily fundamentals will likely provide the bulk of
direction, livestock analysts said.
    The increase of 66.4 mln lbs in total poultry offsets the
22.6 mln lbs decline in total red meats. Fundamentals may
provide most of the direction in futures on Monday, they said.
    "I think the market is going to be looking at some other
things and accentuate whatever the action of cash markets might
be early next week," Jerry Gidel, livestock analyst for GH
Miller, said.
    Shearson Lehman livestock analyst Chuck Levitt said futures
will be in the shadow of a little larger seasonal hog
marketings pace next week. Also, Easter ham business was
completed this week and there may be less aggressive interest
for pork in general next week.
    "We needed some help from the cold storage report to avert
a possible setback next week in the pork complex," Levitt said.
    Analysts agreed with CME floor traders and called the belly
figure neutral to slightly negative. Although belly stocks were
down 33 pct from last year, they exceeded the average
expectation and actually showed a lighter than expected decline
from last month due to an adjustment to last month's holdings,
they said.
    However, analysts noted that the amount of bellies put in
storage has been light since the beginning of March and this is
a potentially bullish situation.
    Glenn Grimes, agronomist at the University of Missouri,
said, "I would not look for (belly) storage during the next
month or two to be heavier than a year ago - I think it will be
less."

The St. Lawrence Seaway, set
to reopen March 31 after the winter, faces another tough year
because of depressed traffic levels and the possibility of the
first strike in 20 years on the Great Lakes, seaway officials
said.
    Depressed grain exports, rising costs, and competing modes
of transportation are all expected to result in only a marginal
increase over last year's traffic levels -- and revenues -- on
the 2,300 mile waterway, officials said.
    In 1986, a season that ran from April 3 to December 27, the
seaway moved 37.6 mln metric tons of freight between Montreal
and Lake Ontario and 41.6 mln tons on the Welland Canal,
linking Lake Erie and Lake Ontario.
    By comparison, in 1985 about 37 mln tons of cargo traveled
through the Montreal-Lake Ontario section and 42 mln through
the eight-lock canal.
    The waterway is expected to lose 9-10 mln Canadian dlrs
this year, about the same as the estimated deficit for fiscal
1986-87 ending March 31, said William Blair, an executive
member of Canada's St Lawrence Seaway Authority.
    The seaway moves about one-half of Canada's exported grain.
Those exports of the single most important commodity carried on
the waterway have been depressed by world surpluses.
    The Seafarers' International Union, which represents about
2,300 workers on the Great Lakes and the ocean coasts, has said
it will likely go on strike this spring to protest employers'
demands for wage rollbacks and other concessions.
    "It's 99.9 pct (certain)--I guarantee you a strike," Roman
Gralewicz, head of the Seafarers' Canadian branch, has said.
    The Canadian government has called in a labor conciliator
to try to hammer out a contract agreement between the two
sides. The seaway authority said a walkout tying up ships on
the Great Lakes would badly hurt traffic.
    "We haven't had a strike on the seaway for years...a
prolonged strike would have a disasterous effect," Seaway
Authority spokeswoman Gay Hemsley said.
    "These are the heaviest contract talks in the history of the
St Lawrence Seaway," George Miller, vice-president of the
Canadian Lake Carriers Association, an association of major
Canadian shipping companies, said recently.
    The workers' current contract expires May 31. The
association said it is asking for a five per cent cut in wages
for the next three years, reduced crew levels and the power to
restructure crew dispatching.
    The association said its members recorded about a 6 mln dlrs
(U.S.) loss in each of 1985 and 1986 due to lower traffic and
freight rates and increasing competition. The seaway said 1985
was its worst year in two decades.
    Hemsley said the seaway authority plans to raise tolls on
the Welland Canal by eight pct this year, compared to last
year's 15 pct rise, while maintaining a freeze on tolls
throughout the rest of the waterway.
    Canada is responsible for 13 of the seaway's 15 locks and
about 85 pct of its revenues and maintenance costs.
    "We may see and hope for a steady upward climb...but we
won't see a major increase for a number of years," Hemsley said.
    A Canada-U.S. delegation to promote the seaway to shippers
in Western Europe should result in some increased traffic this
season but the full benefits won't be felt for several years,
Blair said.

The four-times-a-year "triple
witching hour" did not jolt Wall Street as much as it has in
the past.
    Market averages finished sharply higher as stock index
futures, index options and options on individual stocks expired
simultaenously. Some analysts warned part of the gain may be
retraced next week. But there were signs Wall Street is getting
used to the phenomeon which causes a huge burst of activity in
the final minutes. Officials of the New York Stock Exchange
said the day went smoothly and efficiently.
    "This has been one of the few times that the consensus has
been right," said Jim Creber, trader at Miller, Tabak, Hirsch
and Co.
    He expects a "follow-through" Monday and Tuesday to the
advance which lifted the Dow Jones Industrial Average 34 points
for the day and 75 points for the entire week.
    Creber, whose firm was one of the first to get involved in
arbitrage activity involving index futures and options, said
the general trend of the market has been upward for months.
"Every time the market comes in, somebody comes along with more
money," he said.
    He said investors adding to Individual Retirement Accounts
prior to a mid-April tax deadline and buying from Japanese
investors are apparently helping push stocks higher.
    Ron Feinstein, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc,
said reports of heavy Japanese buying, just prior to the end of
the fiscal year in Japan, fueled bullish sentiment.
    He said investors who had long positions in stocks hedged
with short positions in index futures rolled the expiring March
futures over into June contracts. But he added different
players with other goals also were active and there was no
simple explanation of the market's gyrations.
    For example, Feinstein noted the June contract for the June
Standard and Poor's 500 stock index future hit 300 about 15
minutes prior to the close of NYSE trading. In 12 minutes, the
contracted dipped to 297.50. "That could have been a wave of
selling from institutional people making a roll," he said.
    It was the first time a nearby contract of the S and P 500
hit 300. The cash index closed at a record 298.17. "It looks
like the market is going to continue to go higher," he said.
    "Triple expirations didn't really mean that much, it was a
strong day for stocks," said Steve Chronowitz of Smith Barney,
Harris Upham and Co.
    Chronowitz said the stock market has been underpinned by
"good solid buying interest" which will cushion any pullback.
    Other investors who were long futures and short stocks
bought stocks on the close today instead of rolling over, said
Mark Zurack of Goldman, Sachs and Co. He cautioned against
"over-dramatizing" the day's activity, which said was more a
reflection of fundamental strength in the markets.
    Leigh Stevens of PaineWebber Group Inc said what he saw was
mostly covering of short positions in stocks as index options
and individual options expired. He said there could be a
decline early next week in the stock market.
    "It looked like it worked well today," said Howard Kramer,
asssistant director of market regulation for the Securities and
Exchange Commission. But he said all of the data will have to
be analyzed next week.
    He said there was relatively little commotion at the close,
with about 50 mln shares changing hands in the final minute
compared to 85 mln in the triple expirations three months
earlier. He noted the Dow industrials jumped about 12 points in
the closing minutes, a modest move for a 2333-point index.
    Kramer pointed out an SEC-NYSE measure to curb volatility,
disclosure of "market-on-close" orders in 50 major stocks 30
minutes prior to the end of trading, showed imbalances of
modest proportions. The disclosures are aimed at evening out
volatility by attracting orders on the opposite side of the
imbalance.
    The data showed more buy orders than sell orders for 47
stocks, a preponderance of sell orders for only one stock, and
no significant imbalance for two stocks. The NYSE had tightened
a rule governing what type of market on close orders can be
accepted in the final half hour.

The Alberta provincial
government will increase its general corporate tax rate on
April 1 to 15 pct from 11 pct under its 1987-88 budget
announced today, provincial treasurer Dick Johnston said.
    The budget forecasts the 1987-88 provincial deficit to be
1.90 billion dlrs, compared to a forecast deficit of 3.30
billion dlrs for fiscal 1987, which ends March 31, Johnston
said.
    The budget forecasts fiscal 1988 revenues of 8.63 billion
dlrs and expenditures of 10.42 billion dlrs, Johnston said.
    The provincial budget raises combined personal and
corporate income taxes by about 20 pct, Johnston said.
    Johnston told a news conference taxes were increased after
revenues from oil and gas taxes fell by 64 pct last year and
are not expected to increase sharply in the short term.
    The provincial government expects resource tax revenues for
fiscal 1987 to fall to 1.30 billion dlrs from a previously
estimated 2.20 billion dlrs, compared to 3.60 billion dlrs
collected in fiscal 1986 before the collapse in oil prices.
    Johnston told reporters he needed to raise taxes in order
to begin moving towards a balanced budget in 1990-91.
    Johnston said the personal income tax increase takes three
forms. The basic provincial tax rate rises to 46.5 pct from
43.5 pct of the basic federal income tax rate.
    The provincial budget also imposed a temporary eight pct
surtax on individuals with taxable income of more than 36,000
dlrs, he said.
    In addition, the government levied a flat one pct surtax on
all individuals with taxable income.
    Johnston said overall government spending of 10.42 billion
dlrs represents a cut of 4.4 pct, but various grants and tax
credits for agriculture and energy industries will remain.

The Federal Home Loan Bank Board
said Dallas-based Vernon Savings and Loan Association, the 15th
largest thrift in Texas, was closed by state authorities and
its assets, deposits and liabilities were transfered to a new
federally chartered association.
    Vernon, with 1.35 billion dlrs of assets and nine offices
in Texas and Oklahoma, was closed after state regulators
concluded it was in unsafe and unsound condition.
    The thrift was owned by Texas businessman Donald Dixon, who
bought it in early 1982, when it had only 120 mln dlrs in
assets.
    The bank board said growth was accomplished largely through
the purchase of brokered deposits and the sale of jumbo
certificates of deposit, which totaled 29 pct of total deposits
at the end of 1986.
    The bank board also said that 96 pct of its loan portfolio
was nonperforming as a result of sloppy loan practices.
    It said Vernon also paid excessive salaries and dividends
to officers and directors and bought a beach house and five
airplances for the use of thrift executives and stockholders.
    The bank board ousted the thrift's officers and directors
and hired another Texas association to run it.
    The bank board also said it closed First Federal of
Maryland, a federal savings association that had 115.2 mln dlrs
in assets. It said its 118 mln dlrs in insured deposits were
transferred to Columbia First Federal Savings and Loan
Association of Washington, D.C.
    The bank board said First Federal had engaged in unsound
loan underwriting practices and many of the loans are now
deliquent. The institution experienced heavy and continuing
losses and became insolvent, the bank board said.

The public prosecutors and police
here arrested five former senior executives of a bankrupt gold
deposit business group for defrauding about 450 clients of
about 1.5 billion yen for gold bars which were never delivered,
police said.
    The case involving the Toyota Shoji Company was highlighted
when its 32-year-old Chairman Kazuo Nagano was stabbed to death
here in public view in June, 1985.
    Television crews which had been waiting outside Nagano's
home filmed two men smashing their way into the home and later
emerging with a bloodstained bayonet.
    The company, established here in 1981, undertook to hold
gold on deposit for investors. It grew into a nationwide
business operation with 87 branch offices and 7,000 employees
at its peak in early 1985.
    Toyota Shoji's business group collected an estimated 200
billion yen from about 30,000 clients, many of them pensioners
and housewives, before the firm went bankrupt in July, 1985,
according to lawyers.
    Of them, some 18,000 clients cla&#127;imed they could get back
neither gold or money, suffering an aggregate loss of 150
billion yen, local press reports said.
    Police said the five arrested on charge of fraud today
included Hiroshi Ishikawa, 47, former Toyota Shoji president,
and a sixth former executive was placed on a wanted list.
    They were suspected of having collaborated with the late
Nagano in swindling about 1.5 billion yen from about 450 people
in Osaka and n&#127;earby Kobe during a six month period just before

Bundesbank vice-president Helmut
Schlesinger said that although West German economic growth was
not expected to be satisfactory in the first 1987 quarter, two
pct growth was still attainable for the whole of the year.
    A further rise in the value of the mark would worsen export
prospects and have a negative effect on investments, he told
the Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper in an interview. But if such
an appreciation did not materialize, the economy would expand.
    The federal government has predicted a growth rate of 2-1/2
pct or more in its annual economic report published in January,
but some economists have said the forecast was too optimistic.
    Schlesinger said private consumption was likely to rise
strongly. Government expenditure and construction were also
expected to increase. But there was uncertainty about the
prospects for exports and investment.
    The Bundesbank had viewed with concern the money supply
overshoot in 1986, but the sharp rise was unlikely to have an
effect on inflation in the forseeable future. However, there
were potential dangers in the long run.
    Schlesinger said there was hope that in 1987 the West
German money supply would grow within the three to six pct
target zone set in December.
    Schlesinger said the dampening effect on inflation of the
drop in import prices could continue to a lesser degree for
some time. Prices in West Germany were likely to rise between
one and two pct this year.
    He said 1987 would be the fifth successive growth year for
the West German economy. Although there was a possibility of a
downturn at some stage in the future, there were no signs this
would happen in 1988.
    The main risks for the West German economy stemmed from its
close ties with the rest of the world, Schlesinger added.

Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski said a tax increase

    Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat, also told the Futures
Industry Association that he did not think congressional tax
writers would approve a tax on stock transfers or ease taxes to
promote U.S. Exports.
    He congratulated House Speaker James Wright for proposing
tax increases to help cut the budget deficit.
    Rostenkowski said he hoped White House Chief of Staff
Howard Baker could persuade President Reagan to support a
package of tax increases and spending cuts.
    He noted that Baker and Treasury Secretary James Baker both
supported tax increases in l982.
    Rostenkowski suggested that about 18 billion dlrs of new
taxes might have to be found, along with nine billion in
defence and spending cuts and another nine billion in domestic
spending reductions. But, he said, proposed tax rises would be
brought to the floor only if House Democratic leaders felt
there was Republican support.
    A string of indictments of Wall Street figures could move
some in Congress to support a tax on stock transfers, he said.
    "But the fact many people don't like what's happening in
financial markets doesn't mean they will be hit with a tax," he
said, noting that Wright's securities tax idea had not been
"fleshed out."
    Efforts by special interests to rewrite provisions of the
tax reform bill will fall on deaf ears, Rostenkowski predicted.

approve legislation to reform the welfare system.

The United States and major Latin
American nations agreed to set aside sharp differences over
control of the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) and
reconsider the issue this summer.
    The bank's policy-making board of governors, meeting here
ahead of this week's IADB annual meetings, put off any
decisions when it became apparent differences between
Washington and the Latin countries ware too great.
    IABD officials said Washington had indicated, however, it
might be prepared to compromise in the future.
    The United States is the principal donor nation and has
pressed the bank, controlled by the Latin American borrowing
nations, to cede virtual veto power over loans to Washington.
    The Reagan administration wants to make the bank part of
its controversial strategy to resolve the debt crisis.
    The U.S. Plan calls for loans from multilateral banks like
the IADB to be tied to economic reforms in debtor nations which
would promote open markets, reduced government intervention and
inflation-free economic growth.
    Brazil, which declared an interest payments moratorium last
month, is leading a challenge to Washington's strategy and
officials here obviously feared any decisions that might deepen
rifts between the United States and Third World nations.
    IADB officials also said Washington hinted at future
compromise. "The U.S. Said it remains hopeful they can reach an
agreement and expressed optimism that such a consensus could be
reached," said an official who asked not to be named.
    Washington has threatened to scuttle a 20-25 billion dlr,
four-year capital replenishment for the bank if the veto issue
is not resolved.
    But it has asked Congress to give it authority to finance
its one-third share in the event agreement on voting power is
reached. The United States controls 34.5 pct of the vote and
wants a loan veto to exist at the 35 pct level.
    Currently, a simple majority can approve or disapprove
loans giving the borrowing nations control of the purse strings
and resulting in loan conditions too lax for Washington's
taste.
    The U.S. Strategy for dealing with the debt crisis is
expected to be repeated by Treasury Secretary James Baker in a
speech to the bank's annual meeting on Monday.
    But monetary sources expect Baker to suggest the United
States has some room for compromise and also to fend off other
challenges to its strategy by signalling Washington is open to
innovative solutions to the debt problem.

U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker
again said the meeting of six major industrial nations in Paris
last month did not establish a target exchange rate for the

    Baker said in a television interview aired here yesterday:
"We don't have a target for the dollar." He declined to comment
on what might be a desired level for the dollar, saying: "We
really don't talk about the dollar."
    He said protectionism was becoming "extremely strong" in the
U.S. In response to widening U.S. Trade deficits and import
barriers in other countries.
    "The mood in the United States is extremely disturbing. It's
extremely strong," he said.
    "As I've said before, we sort of see ourselves as engaged
here in a real struggle to preserve the world's free trading
system, because if the largest market in the world (the U.S.)
goes protectionist we run the risk of moving down the same path
that the world did in the late 1930s," he said.
    While relative exchange rates had a role to play in
defusing the threat of protectionism, it alone did not offer
any solution, he said.
    "You must address this problem on the exchange rate side,
but it cannot be solved on the exchange rate side alone. It's
far more comprehensive and broad than that, and the solution of
it requires a comprehensive approach," Baker said in the
interview.
    Baker said it would be necessary for other countries to
adjust their currencies upwards, as well as remove their
barriers to U.S. Imports. But he did not elaborate or name any

A hefty slice of new U.S. Treasury
supply is not the most welcome prospect for a slumbering credit
market, but at least this week's offerings should provide it
with some focus, economists said.
    "Banks and mutual funds have cash that should be put to
work, so the auctions should breathe some life into the market,"
said economists at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc.
    The Treasury will place a 25 billion dlr package of
two-year, four-year and seven-year notes on the sales block
this week.
    The "mini-refunding," which will raise 9.27 billion dlrs in
new cash, comprises 10 billion dlrs of two-year notes for
auction on Tuesday, 7.75 billion dlrs of four-year notes on
Wednesday and 7.25 billion dlrs of seven-year notes on
Thursday. The market also faces the regular weekly three- and
six-month bill auction today, amounting to 12.8 billion dlrs.
    The mini-refunding does not come at a particularly
auspicious time for the market. Bond prices have been drifting
sideways in a narrow range against the backdrop of a cloudy
U.S. Economic outlook, diminished chances of a change in
Federal Reserve Board policy and a stable dollar.
    Moreover, the bond market's inertia has compared
unfavourably with the rash of activity taking place in
high-yield markets overseas, like the U.K., As well as in U.S.
Equities.
    But according to the Merrill Lynch economists, there are
signs the pall hanging over the U.S. Bond market is lifting a
bit.
    "Customer activity has been light, but all on the buy-side,
and there is a marked absence of selling," they said in a weekly
report.
    Philip Braverman of Irving Trust Securities Inc believes
banks will snap up the two- and four-year issues at this week's
sales.
    "The banks are in need of investments that provide earnings.
Though the yield spread to the cost of carrying these
maturities has been wider, it is still positive," he said in a
weekly market review.
    But economists agreed not even the auctions will generate
enough impetus for a major move. This will only come once the
overseas markets have had their run.
    "Based on last week's events, there is little to indicate
that the appetite for yield has begun to wane," said economists
at Salomon Brothers Inc.
    Indeed, talk persisted last week that Japanese investors
are planning to re-weight their portfolios in favour of the
higher-yielding markets at the start of Japan's new fiscal year
on April 1.
    And while traditionally the Japanese have not been big
buyers of the shorter-dated issues on offer at this week's U.S.
Auctions, such reports undermine market confidence.
    Even actions by the British, Australian and Canadian
monetary authorities to curb the rise of their currencies
should also enhance the attractiveness of their respective bond
markets, the Salomon Brothers' economists said.
    Meanwhile, ecomomic releases are unlikely to enliven the
U.S. Market unless they deviate widely from expectations,
economists said.
    This week's economic calendar begins on Tuesday with
February durable goods orders. Economists expect a rebound from
January's depressed levels.
    Peter Greenbaum of Smith, Barney, Harris Upham and Co said
several areas, including transport equipment, should have
bounced back. But a decline in military capital goods will cap
total new orders. He forecasts a rise of two pct after
January's 6.7 pct slump. Some other economists foresee a gain
as large as five pct.
    Friday's consumer price report for February is expected to
show an increase of about 0.3 pct after a 0.7 pct January gain.
Economists said energy prices -- the driving force behind the
January rise -- rose more moderately last month, while food
prices declined.
    Meanwhile, economists warned that the federal funds rate
will be subject to volatility in the weeks ahead due to the
approach of quarter-end and the mid-April tax date.
    Some economists expect the Fed to execute a bill pass this
week because its adding requirement increases sharply in the
new statement period beginning on Thursday.
    Fed funds traded at 6-1/16 pct late Friday and are expected
to open near that level.

The solution of the world's debt
crisis requires open markets but a possible resurgence of
protectionism is the biggest danger, the president of the
Federal Association of German Banks, Wolfgang Roeller, said.
    Roeller, who is also management board spokesman of Dresdner
Bank AG, said in a radio interview it is unlikely Brazil's
suspension last month of part of its interest payments would
lead to a chain reaction in Latin America.
    It is important to increase the efficiency of debtor
countries to such an extent they earn sufficient currency from
exports to repay foreign debt, he said.
    Brazil had taken a unilateral step, Roeller said, but
Brazil had a strong and broad economic base. With the help of
appropriate economic programmes there should be a way to bring
back financial stability to that country.
    Roeller said action on the debt situation had to be taken
now. It could not be expected debtor countries would be able to
repay debts in the short run, even if economic conditions
improved. Programmes had to be developed which would strengthen
the economic position of these countries, to ensure world
economic growth so they are able to sell their products at
adequate prices.
    Roeller said the debt crisis could only be solved in
coordination with governments, international organisations such
as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, and
creditor banks.
    "This is not a topic which can be solved by creditor banks
alone," he said. One aim had to be to raise the credit standing
of debtor countries to such a degree they are able to raise
funds on international credit markets again. He said a whole
set of new ideas had been developed and he was convinced the
international banking system would provide more funds, but the
problem is not just economic but also political.

Economics Minister Martin Bangemann said
the state could not continue to pour money into West Germany's
ailing steel and coal industries because the subsidies
endangered other parts of the economy.
    "The situation is completely absurd from an economic point
of view," Bangemann told the newspaper Die Welt in an interview
released ahead of publication tomorrow.
    "We are subsidising the production of mineral coal and steel
to an enormous extent and at the same time putting a huge
burden on all other branches of industry and making them
uncompetitive," he said.
    Bangemann said the steel and coal industries were no longer
capable of being competitive. Continued state subsidies would
not save them but would only prolong their lives artifically
for a few years, he said.
    "That is why I have refused to continue subsidising them in
the way that we have done in the past," he said.
    Several steel firms have announced plans to reduce their
workforces, citing weak prices and lower exports due to the
strength of the mark and tough foreign competition.
    Bangemann said everything possible would be done to find
new jobs for the workers affected by the cuts.

<Dart Group Corp> said it told
Supermarkets General Corp <SGL> it was flexible on the price it
would pay to acquire the company.
    Dart has said it would offer 41.75 dlrs cash for each SGL
share if the SGL board recommended the offer to shareholders.
    SGL has termed the 1.62 billion dlr offer unsolicited.
    In a letter to SGL dated March 20, Dart also said it was
denied confidential information on SGL that would be given to
other potential bidders.
    SGL officials could not be reached for comment.
    Dart said it was advised that a selling brochure for the
sale of SGL had been distributed to about 20 potential buyers,
but not itself. These purchasers would also be given access to
SGL's books and records and the opportunity to talk with key
employees.
    "We suspect that one or more of the 20 are leveraged buyout
firms," said a source close to Dart. Analysts have said SGL
management may be considering a leveraged buyout.
    Dart said it remains interested in acquiring SGL on a
friendly basis and reiterated its willingness to negotiate all
the terms of its offer.
    Dart said SGL representatives said the company has not
received any other offer.
    It said it requested the confidential information to better
understand SGL, but was denied this because it refused to sign
an agreement prohibiting it from making a bid for SGL without
SGL's approval.
    The agreement would also have limited its ability to buy
SGL shares, Dart said. It considered those conditions
unreasonable in the interest of trying to negotiate a friendly
transaction, it said.
    Dart has just under five pct of SGL shares.
    Dart said it requested the information before its meeting
with SGL representatives, but held the meetings in the hope
representatives would reach an agreement.
    It said it indicated it was flexible on price, but was told
there were certain issues important to SGL management and while
they were not conditions to the deal, Dart was expected to take
them into account in putting together its package.
    It said the issues include an immediate payment of 5.7 mln
dlrs to SGL chairman Leonard Lieberman, executive vice
president James Dougherty and financial officer Murray Levine.
    Dart said this payment was intended for the three officers'
severance agreements, although there was an implication that
Lieberman and Dougherty would be leaving the company of their
own volition.
    Dart said under their present agreements, none of these
officers have any right to such accelerated payments. Also,
Dart said Lieberman, Dougherty and Levine are to be paid 2.6
mln dlrs to pay their taxes. It also said top management's
incentive shares were to be accelerated and paid for at a cost
of six mln dlrs although there are restrictions on the shares
unless waived by the company's compensation committee.
    Dart said it was to fund up to five mln dlrs for top
management's supplemental retirement plan.
    Dart said another issue was to agree to future severance
obligations and future salary guarantees for top management,
estimated at more than 15 mln dlrs in excess of obligations
under the company's present policy.
    Dart said despite such management payments, it agreed to
discuss all aspects of its offer and in fact did try to
negotiate a transaction at the March 18 meeting with SGL.
    Supermarkets General owns the Path Mark supermarket chain
and Rickels home centres.
    Dart also released a copy of a lawsuit that was being filed
by an SGL shareholder, seeking to stop SGL from taking such
actions as paying greenmail or enacting a poison pill defence.
    The suit also sought to have directors carry out their
fiduciary duty.
    Greenmail is the payment at a premium for shares held by an
unwanted suitor and a poison pill is typically the issue of
securities to shareholders which make a takeover more
expensive.

Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone defended
his tax reform plans from fierce opposition, even within his
own party, as campaigning for local elections began.
    "Our plan to reform the nation's tax system is by no means
wrong. Unless we reform the system now, Japan is bound to
decay, perhaps within the next 10 years," Nakasone told
supporters of his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).
    The April 12 and 26 elections will be the first nationwide
vote since the LDP's general election victory last July.
    Opposition parties have shown rare unity in joining to
fight a proposed five pct sales tax, one of the main planks in
the tax reform package, and are now challenging the
LDP-dominated local governments and assemblies.
    In Tokyo, incumbent Governor Shunichi Suzuki backed by the
LDP and two centrist parties has said he cannot support the
sales tax as it stands.
    A survey by the National Broadcasting Corporation just over
three weeks ago showed 70 pct of those polled said they would
take the tax, which Nakasone proposes to implement next
January, into consideration when they vote.
    Takako Doi, Chairwoman of the Japan Socialist Party, said
in a speech in central Tokyo where shop-owners are opposing the
tax "The elections are a plebiscite against the sales tax. Your
vote is a vote to force (Nakasone) to retract (it)."
    The LDP is putting up its own candidates only in Iwate and
western Shimane but it is supporting independents jointly with
other parties in other prefectures.
    A close aide to Nakasone, who asked not to be identified,
said he sees the sales tax having little impact on the local
elections since almost all candidates, irrespective of party
affiliation, are opposing it in prefectural assembly polls.

Japan has assured a meeting
of trade ministers it is making every effort to expand domestic
demand and restructure its economy.
    Japanese trade representative Tsomu Hata told an informal
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) meeting that, in
addition to demand boosting measures adopted last September, a
comprehensive economic program will be prepared after the
1987/88 budget is approved.
    Hata, speaking at the first session of the two-day meeting,
said agriculture is no exception to the goal of restructuring
the economy, but did not elaborate.
    Hata said protectionist pressures in the international
economy are as strong as ever, reflecting financial deficits,
payment imbalances and serious unemployment in many countries.
    Despite great potential, developing economies are still
confronted by grave difficulties, particularly debt, he added.
    The basis for the talks is the GATT ministerial declaration
last September in Punta del Este, Uruguay, and the subsequent
trade negotiating plan agreed in Geneva.
    "It is essential that we first reaffirm here our commitment
to implementing that plan as scheduled," Hata said.
    Hata added it is not constructive to speed up negotiations
in some areas at the expense of others.
    In order to rebuild the free trade system, it is important
for each participant to have domestic policies that will serve
this end.
    As part of its contribution, Japan plans in April to
fundamentally improve its generalised system of preferences for
industrial and mining products to make Japan's domestic market
more open to developing countries, he said.

Japan is expected to post a 3.6 pct rise
in real gross national product in 1987/88, higher than the
official 3.5 pct target, a private economic institute said.
    The Research Institute on National Economy said in a report
the economy will start picking up in the April-June quarter,
partly because of an improvement in earnings performance and
capital spending in manufacturing industries.
    The institute assumed an average exchange rate in the year
starting April 1 of 150 yen to the dollar. It predicted the
Bank of Japan will not change the official discount rate in the
year.
    The institute forecast that Japan's exports will gradually
rise in the year in volume terms as the dollar's fall in the
past 18 months is likely to help prop up the U.S. Economy.
    Japan's trade surplus is expected to narrow slightly to
90.2 billion dlrs in 1987/88 ending March 31 from an estimated

French 1987 growth will probably be about
two pct, the same as last year, due to an international
environment that is less favourable than expected, Finance
Minister Edouard Balladur was quoted as saying.
    Treasury director Daniel Lebegue said last month that gross
domestic product is expected to grow by between two and 2.5 pct
this year, against an original target of 2.8 pct.

French gross domestic product should grow
by 2.3 pct in 1988 after two pct growth this year and 2.1 pct
in 1986, the Finance Ministry said.
    The latest forecast, prepared by the National Accounts and
Budget Commission, assumed an exchange rate of 6.20 francs to
the dollar this year and next and an average oil import price
rising to 18.9 dlrs a barrel next year from 17.4 dlrs this year
and 14.7 in 1986.
    The Commission, headed by Finance minister Edouard
Balladur, forecast a fall in consumer price inflation to two
pct year-on-year at end-1988 from 2.4 pct at end 1987 and 2.1
pct last year.
    In annual average terms inflation would fall to two pct in
1988 from 2.5 pct this year and 2.7 pct last year, it said.
    Trade should show a one billion franc annual surplus this
year and next after last year's 0.5 billion surplus, it added.
    Employment should rise by 0.1 pct a year over the next two
years while the state budget deficit should be cut to 2.2 pct
of GDP in 1988 from 2.6 pct this year and 2.9 pct in 1986.
    Other forecasts prepared by the Commission indicated a 1.8
pct 1988 rise in household purchasing power, up from 1.1 pct
this year but less than last year's 2.9 pct, and a 1.6 pct rise
in household consumption, compared with this year's 1.5 pct and
last year's 2.9 pct.

this year and next after 3.7 pct last year, with private sector
productive investment rising 4.9 pct in 1988 after a six pct
rise this year and 5.5 pct in 1986.

A settlement could soon be reached in the
dispute between European sugar producers and the European
Community over EC export licencing policies, Jean-Marc Vernes,
president of French sugar producer Beghin-Say, which is leading
the protest, told journalists today.
    "Our contacts with the EC authorities over the past few days
indicate that we are moving towards a solution," he said, adding
that if this happened the producers would withdraw the 854,000
tonnes of sugar they have offered into intervention.
    Vernes said that the protest, involving 770,000 tonnes of
sugar from French producers alone, was prompted by the EC's
policy since mid-1986 of offering export rebates which failed
to give producers an equivalent price to that they would obtain
by offering sugar into EC intervention.
    At last week's tender the EC Commission made an apparent
concession by offering a maximum rebate only 1.3 European
currency units (Ecus) per 100 kilos below the level producers
say is needed, compared with the previous week's rebate which
was 2.5 Ecus below the necessary level.
    Vernes would not say what form any compromise between the
producers and the EC would take, but he reaffirmed the
long-term desire of producers to export to the world market,
providing they were not losing money by doing so.
    Producers can withdraw their intervention offer after April
1, when the sugar will officially enter intervention stores, or
at any time over the following five weeks before the official
payment date.
    The EC has threatened to put the sugar back on the internal
market if the producers refuse to withdraw their offers.

Japan's long-term banks will soon cut
their prime rate, now at a record low 5.5 pct, by 0.2 or 0.3
percentage point in response to falling secondary market yields
on their five-year debentures, long-term bankers said.
    The long-term prime rate is customarily set 0.9 percentage
point above the coupon on five-year bank debentures issued by
the long-term banks every month.
    The latest bank debentures, at 4.6 pct, have met strong
end-investor demand on the prospect of further declines in yen
interest rates, dealers said. The current 5.5 pct prime rate
has been in effect since February 28.

The business climate in West German
manufacturing industry worsened slightly last month after
deteriorating markedly in January, the IFO economic research
institute said.
    It said its February survey showed firms were also
increasingly pessimistic about the outlook for the coming
months, causing them to cut back production plans.
    IFO blamed the worsening of the business climate and
outlook largely on expectations of further declines in foreign
demand.
    More than a quarter of the firms polled said they thought
orders in hand were insufficient.
    Overall, the business climate in February could be
described as just short of satisfactory, IFO said.
    In a breakdown of responses by industrial sector, the
institute said manufacturers of basic products judged the
business climate to be slightly less favourable in February
than in January. For the coming months they expect export
prospects to dim and production to fall, it added.
    Chemical firms reported a slight improvement in demand but
they increasingly said orders on hand were insufficient.
    The business climate in the capital goods industry was
unchanged in February compared with January, but IFO said this
was due entirely to positive reports from makers of commercial
vehicles.
    Demand in the capital goods sector was generally described
as weak, with the outlook in February cloudier than it had been
in January, the institute said.
    The business climate in the consumer durables sector
remained above the industry average in February. Carmakers were
again positive about current business but forecast a slight
worsening of business conditions in the near future.
    In the consumer goods industry business conditions were
described as favourable in February.
    A small cutback in production meant orders on hand in this
sector rose compared with January, the institute said.

French industrial production fell a
seasonally adjusted 1.98 pct in January after revised unchanged
output in December, the National Statistics Institute (INSEE)
said.
    The figure, which excludes construction and public works,
put the January index, base 1980, at 99 after 101 in December.
January output was 1.98 pct down on January 1986.
    INSEE, which from January changed its base year to 1980
from 1970, originally had December output down 2.2 pct on
November, using the old base year.
    INSEE said production in January was affected by rail
strikes and severely cold weather.
    It said output of gas and electricity was very high but
activity slowed on construction sites, in quarries and in
certain base industries.

USAir Group Inc said it has amended
its 69 dlr per share tender offer for shares of Piedmont
Aviation Inc to reduce the maximum number it will accept to
9,309,394. Previously it had sought all shares.
    In a newspaper advertisement, USAir said the offer and
withdrawal rights have not been extended and will still expire
April 3, along with the new proration period.
    On Friday, the U.S. Department of Transportation approved
USAir's acquisition of 51 pct of Piedmont. If USAir were to
acquire more than 51 pct in the tender, it would be required to
sell the excess within one week.
    USAir said receipt of the 9,309,394 shares -- which is also
the minimum amount it will accept -- would give it a total of
about 61 pct of Piedmont shares currently outstanding and 50.1
pct on a fully diluted basis.
    The company said even if the purchase of the 9,309,394
Piedmont shares caused it to exceed the 51 pct limit, USAir
would waive the condition to the offer that the Transportation
Department approve a voting trust agreement permitting USAir to
buy and hold shares under the offer pending review of USAir's
application to gain control of Piedmont, subject to the order
not being rescinded or modified in an adverse way.

qualified the company's 1986 financial report.

contested.
    The report was filed today with the Securities and Exchange
Commission along with a copy of Chrysler Corp's <C> proposal to
take over American Motors.
    American Motors said earlier than an arbitration award,
made to Emerson Electric Co <EMR> in February, amounted to 60
mln dlrs plus legal expenses. American Motors has challenged
the award.
    The automaker sold the AM General unit to LTV Corp <QLTV>
in 1983, the same year it was awarded a five-year, 1.2 billion
dlr procurement contract with the military. LTV and AM General
last year sought protection under Chapter 11.
    The arbitration proceeding was called after Emerson
Electric charged AM General violated an agreement covering the
development of certain components in the contract.
    The components were for the military's "High Mobility
Multi-Purpose Wheeled Vehicle" (HMMWV), American Motors said.
    In selling AM General to LTV, American Motors agreed to
indemnify LTV against losses incurred by LTV resulting from the
Emerson Electric claims.
    AMC also said the award has not been confirmed by a court,

The Inter-American Development Bank
said it intended this year to match the over three billion dlrs
it lent to Latin America in 1986, despite growing pressures on
its capital.
    In its annual report and in a briefing for reporters, the
Bank made it clear, however, that the Latin countries needed
vast amounts of new investment if they are to strengthen their
ailing economies in the period ahead. The report said Latin
America continued to emerge slowly from the deep recession that
began in the early 1980s, with Gross Domestic Product edging up
to nearly four pct from 3.5 pct in 1985.
    The report said the region's improved economic growth last
year was based on a rise in internal demand and fuller
utilization previously underused production capacity.
    "This situation will be difficult to duplicate in 1987 and
beyond because no significant new investments are being made,"
the report said.
    The Bank's lending last year consisted of 63 loans totaling
3.04 billion dlrs, bringing the agency's cumulative lending to
35.44 billion dlrs.
    Of last year's loans, 2.26 billion dlrs was actually
disbursed, bringing total disbursements to 24.03 billion dlrs.
    To assist in loan activities, the Bank said it borrowed
1.91 billion dlrs in the capital markets in 1986, bringing its
total outstanding borrowings to 12.11 billion dlrs.
    In a briefing for reporters, Bank President Antonio
Ortiz-Mena said that this year lending by the bank "will be at a
similar level to last year."
    He noted that bank lending in 1986 was directed
particularly to projects in energy, agriculture, and
environmental and public health, education and urban
development. The annual report was released as the Bank's
annual meeting is being held in Miami.
    Ortiz-Mena told reporters that the bank's member countries
will discuss a plan by the United States to reduce the loan
veto power from the current majority to 35 pct.
    Such a plan would allow the United States to block any loan
it did not like with the assistance of only one other country.
    The proposal, which is tied to any U.S. backing for a new
financing for the bank, is sure to run into rough going as the
Latin countries view it as a move by the Reagan administration
to control the agency's critical loans.
    The U.S. position is that it is not seeking veto power
although it believes the bank's largest contributors should
have greater influence within the institution.

Because its novel financing deal sold
quickly last week, General Motors Corp's <GM> General Motors
Acceptance Corp unit plans to do more multi-tiered financings,
said Michael Mangan of GMAC.
    "We are certainly happy with the transaction. We plan to do
more," said Mangan, director of corporate financing.
    Offered on Wednesday, the 100 mln dlr issue had three price
levels to attract a wide range of retail investors and small
regional institutions, said officers of P.W. Korth and Co Inc
and PaineWebber Inc, which shared bookrunning duties.
    "We will continue to look at multi-tiered financings,"
Mangan said.
    "GMAC plans to talk to Korth and PaineWebber and get their
thoughts on the deal. We want to see how it went and where the
securities were placed," the GMAC officer added.
    Mangan and the co-lead managers said the three different
pricings enabled the finance arm of General Motors to borrow at
attractive rates. "GMAC saved some basis points with this
technique," said an officer on Korth's syndicate desk.
    "Our all-in-cost was comparable. If the deal had not made
sense, obviously we would not have done it," Mangan noted.
    The GMAC seven-year notes were given a coupon of 7.45 pct.
    For investors buying less than 100,000 dlrs of the notes,
the offering was priced at par to yield 45 basis points over
comparable Treasury securities.
    Those buying 100,000 to 250,000 dlrs pay 99.60 for a yield
of 7.52 pct, or 53 basis points over Treasuries. For purchases
of more than 250,000 dlrs, the notes carried a price of 99.20
to yield 7.599 pct, or 61 basis points over Treasuries.
    In contrast, Ford Motor Co's <F> Ford Motor Credit Co unit
last month sold 300 mln dlrs of same-maturity notes priced to
yield 7.62 pct, or 62.5 basis points over Treasuries.
    "Retail investors generally do not see new issue product,"
said an officer on PaineWebber's corporate syndicate desk.
"They have to buy the securities in the secondary market."
    Bond traders said many corporates rose well above par in
the secondary market this year. They attributed this to a huge
number of bond redemptions by the issuing companies.
    "Institutions and mutual funds are seeing some of their
holdings called away. They're scrambling to replace them," said
one trader. As a result, underwriters said retail investors
would gladly sacrifice some of the yield spread over Treasuries
if they could buy debt issues at or below par.
    "The GMAC financing seemed tailor-made for those retail
investors," commented one underwriter away from the syndicate.
    GMAC's Mangan said his firm also wanted to sell securities
that were aimed at the retail sector.
    "Access to retail investors was the driving force behind
the multi-tiered financing. This is a new market for us, so to
speak," Mangan said.
    "There is a lot of GMAC paper out there," the executive
added, referring to the unit's past offerings. "One of our
basic strategies is to target securities to specific investors
and hopefully attain a broader distribution."
    Officers of Korth and PaineWebber said the GMAC notes were
selling quickly last week, although the issue had not sold out
by Friday afternoon.
    "In selling to retail investors or smaller institutions,
you have to make a lot more telephone calls," an investment
banker pointed out.
    Underwriters noted that Korth and PaineWebber, along with
co-managers A.G. Edwards and Thomson McKinnon, have strong
retail bases. "They can carve out a niche here," one said.
    "We plan to underwrite more of these deals," said a Korth
official. An officer with PaineWebber echoed that sentiment.
    Multi-tiered financings are a relatively new wrinkle on
Wall Street. An officer with Korth said he belives his firm
underwrote the first such issue eight or nine months ago for
Citicorp <CCI>.
    GMAC's Mangan said his company issued through Korth in
October 1986 a 50 mln dlr issue that carried two different
price levels.
    "But the price gap between the first and second tier was
large," Mangan said. In our conversations with the
underwriters, we thought three different tiers would make more
sense because the prices would not be far apart."
    Meanwhile, underwriting syndicates are scheduled to bid
competitively tomorrow for 250 mln dlrs of first and refunding
mortgage bonds due 2017 of Philadelphia Electric Co <PE>.
Non-refundable for five years, the debt is rated Baa-3 by
Moody's and BBB-minus by Standard and Poor's.
    Southern Railway Co, a unit of Norfolk Southern Corp <NSC>,
will hold accept bids on Wednesday for 20 mln dlrs of serial
equipment trust certificates. The debt is rated a top-flight
AAA by both Moody's and S and P.
    IDD Information Services said the 30-day corporate visible

The Commerce Department published
revisions to monthly data on factory orders indicating some
substantial changes to published figures for recent months.
    The revisions take account of several factors including
adjustments to unfilled orders levels, recalculation of new
orders estimates and updating of seasonal adjustment factors,
the department said.
    As a result, December factory orders reported as rising 1.6
pct rose on the revised basis by 3.2 pct, while November orders
reported as 3.6 pct were up only 0.8 pct on the revised basis,
the department said.
    Commerce has already reported January factory orders fell
4.0 pct. The report on February orders is due next week and
that figure will be revised then.
    The revisions, which cover the years 1982-1986, also affect
the key category of durable goods orders. The department said
durables orders reported as 1.5 pct higher in December were up
5.3 pct on the revised basis and November orders reported 5.1
pct higher were up a revised 3.0 pct.
    The department reported January durable goods orders fell
7.5 pct and is scheduled to release February orders on Tuesday
morning.
    The January durable goods orders will be revised and
February orders reported on a basis consistent with the
revisions, Commerce said.
    For all of 1986, factory orders were originally reported as
being unchanged from 1985 levels, but the department said after
revisions orders fell 0.6 pct last year.
    Among changes in the orders survey, the department said it
was changing inventory values to reflect current costs rather
than book value of unsold goods.

Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone defended
his tax reform plans from fierce opposition, even within his
own party, as campaigning for local elections began.
    "Our plan to reform the nation's tax system is by no means
wrong. Unless we reform the system now, Japan is bound to
decay, perhaps within the next 10 years," Nakasone told
supporters of his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).
    The April 12 and 26 elections will be the first nationwide
vote since the LDP's general election victory last July.
    Opposition parties have shown rare unity in joining to
fight a proposed five pct sales tax, one of the main planks in
the tax reform package, and are now challenging the
LDP-dominated local governments and assemblies.
    In Tokyo, incumbent Governor Shunichi Suzuki backed by the
LDP and two centrist parties has said he cannot support the
sales tax as it stands.
    A survey by the National Broadcasting Corporation just over
three weeks ago showed 70 pct of those polled said they would
take the tax, which Nakasone proposes to implement next
January, into consideration when they vote.
    Takako Doi, Chairwoman of the Japan Socialist Party, said
in a speech in central Tokyo where shop-owners are opposing the
tax "The elections are a plebiscite against the sales tax. Your
vote is a vote to force (Nakasone) to retract (it)."
    The LDP is putting up its own candidates only in Iwate and
western Shimane but it is supporting independents jointly with
other parties in other prefectures.
    A close aide to Nakasone, who asked not to be identified,
said he sees the sales tax having little impact on the local
elections since almost all candidates, irrespective of party
affiliation, are opposing it in prefectural assembly polls.

U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker said
he was making progress negotiating reform of the Inter-American
Development Bank with other member nations.
    In a speech prepared for delivery to the annual meeting of
the IADB, Baker said, "We are making progress in negotiating
reforms."
    And he added that if succesful, Washington would be ready
to put up an additional nine billion dlrs to the seventh IADB
four-year capital replenishment, an increase of 75 pct.
    It was not immediately clear what the overall size of the
capital replenishment would be if the U.S. went ahead with such
a capital increase.
    But Baker's statement that he had made progress in
negotiating reforms came after a weekend meeting of the bank's
policy making board of governors at which the reform issue was
put off until next June because of deep differences between
Washington and Latin borrowing countries.
    Baker said the U.S. increase would account for 70 pct of
the bank's useable financial resources.
    Currently Washington is only allowed to vote 34.5 pct in
IADB board meetings considering loans to Latin American
countries.
    But the Latin borrowing nations control 54 pct of the vote
and frequently approve loans to which economic reform
conditions are not tied.
    Baker pointed out that Western nations which provide 95 pct
of the bank's financial resources represent just 46 pct of the
vote.
    Baker said the U.S seeks a greater say in bank decisions
for itself and other creditor countries.
    "In view of this imbalance we don't believe it is
unreasonable to ask for a change," Baker said. He said the
changes sought by the U.S. would require loan approval by a
greater majority of shares than a simple majority.
    But he stopped short of reaffirming the original U.S.
position that veto power should exist with a 35 pct vote.
    Enlarging on reforms Washington would like to see, Baker
said he wanted the IADB to play a much greater role in the U.S.
debt strategy for promoting inflation free economic growth,
open markets and a reduced government role in the economies of
debtor nations.
    Under reforms he said the U.S. wants the IADB to adopt a
major program of lending to specific economic sectors in debtor
countries on condition the countries carried out policy reforms
in those areas of their economies.
    Such reforms would include, among other things, more
concern for natural resource management.
    Baker said this lending should help debtors make a
transition to more open economies and freer markets.
    He also said the bank could double its current lending
volume from capital and triple its concessional loans to the
poorest nations.
    The Treasury Secretary also called for the IADB to improve
its analysis of the policies of debtor countries, strengthening
its process for assessing the specific needs of debtor nations.
He urged a wholesale reorganization of bank personnel. Baker
said, "We simply believe that more discretion and policy
influence should lie with the parties which contribute the
lion's share of resources."
    He pointed out that despite tight budget problems the
Reagan administration has asked Congress to finance the IADB
and other multilateral development banks.
    Pointing out that such funding was difficult today in the
best of circumstances, he said it would be impossible if
Congress did not have confidence in bank lending policies.

Tonka Corp said it expects
results for its fiscal first quarter to end April four, to
decline from the record earnings of 3.8 mln dlrs or 57 cts a
share and revenues of 53.2 mln dlrs.
    The toy manufacturer attributed its anticipated lower
financial results to an an expected moderate decline in
shipments of its Pound Puppies product line.
    Tonka also said it expects revenues and earnings to remain
lower through the 1987 first half compared with 1986 record
results of 125.4 mln dlrs in revenues and 10.3 mln dlrs in net
earnings or 1.47 dlrs a share.
    The company said its level of shipments is good despite a
conservative buying pattern on the part of retailers industry
wide. Tonka's first quarter shipments will be down somewhat
from 1986 record levels and gross profit margins will be down
slightly from a year ago, it said.
    Second half sales are expected to be stronger based on a
return to a more traditional seasonal shipping pattern in which
retailers order and stock conservatively early in the year and
time large shipments for the second half, it said.
    Tonka said that while the pace of order writing is trailing
last year's, bookings are "very good" for orders on several of
its new product introductions for 1987.

Bayerische Vereinsbank AG <BVMG.F>
expects to pay an unchanged dividend of 13 marks on 1987
earnings but profits will only barely reach last year's record
levels, management board spokesman Maximilian Hackl said.
    He told the annual news conference that possible credit
risks, especially those associated with foreign nations, had
largely been covered. Risk provisions in 1987 were therefore
unlikely to reach the same high level as in 1986.
    Group bank net profit rose to 275.52 mln marks in 1986 from
222.73 mln the previous year and parent bank net profit
increased to 187.63 mln marks from 161.58 mln.
    Hackl said that interest margins in the banking business
had declined to 2.71 pct last year from 2.78 pct the previous
year. But in the mortgage sector, the margins had increased
slightly and stood around 0.7 pct.
    Parent bank commission surplus in the securities business
had risen almost 15 pct to 358 mln marks in 1986.
    Expenses for personnel had increased 7.5 pct to 782 mln
marks and others costs had increased 9.4 pct to 272 mln marks.
    The parent bank's 1986 partial operating profit, which
excludes earnings from trading on its own account, had climbed
two pct to 671 mln marks.
    The parent bank's balance sheet total rose 5.3 pct to 81.5
billion marks at end-1986 compared with end-1985, Hackl said.
    It was boosted by a three billion mark rise in mortgage
business and a 1.1 billion mark increase in banking business.
    The mortgage sector's share in total parent bank business
volume rose to 46 pct from 45.
    Hackl said that in January and February this year, the
bank's credit business had not livened up. But despite the
sharp downturn on German bourses, profits from trading on own
account had increased in the first two 1987 months compared
with the same year-ago period. He gave no detailed figures.

Treasury Secretary James Baker urged
commercial banks to be open to new ideas for reducing the third
world debt burden.
    "I believe the commercial banks need to be open to creative
ideas for reducing the debt burden," Baker told the annual
meeting of the Inter-American Development Bank.
    But he said that he was confident banks would make
"substantial new lending" to the major debtors this year.
    He pointed out principal debtor nations are expected to
grow an average 3.5 pct this year, the fastest real rate of
growth since 1980.
    Saying the U.S. debt strategy was making "substantial
headway", Baker said import volumes of debtor countries are
forecast to jump over six pct in 1987 and export volumes almost
five pct -- the best performance in three years.
    He also said economic growth has kept pace with or
surpassed the growth in debt for nine of the 15 major debtors
since 1983.
    "This is a start -- and I venture to say a good one," the
Treasury Secretary said, and he urged the audience of Western
and Latin finance officials and bankers to stand fast against
suggestions of solutions like debt relief.
    While such ideas have political appeal, Baker said, they
would mean a drying up of capital flowing to debtors.
    And even if free market reforms followed, debt fogiveness
would frighten away investors who would not "risk their capital
in a country which abandoned its obligations."
    And he said, "A debt forgiveness plan that damages
commercial banks also weakens confidence in world financial
stability."
    He cautioned that resolving the debt situation would be a
"gradual and painstaking" process, varying from country to
country.
    Reporting on the U.S. debt strategy, Baker said attitudes
in debtor nations have changed and there is much greater
acceptance of free market reforms than hitherto.
    Some countries like Argentina are pursuing anti-inflation
programs. Others, like the Philippines and Chile, are
privatizing companies and swapping debt for equity.
    The International Monetary Fund and World Bank, meanwhile,
have committed nearly 12 billion dlrs in loans for the 15 major
debtor nations since late 1985, official creditors have
rescheduled 14.5 billion dlrs in outstanding loans through the
Paris club, while commercial banks are making new loans.
    Baker pointed out the banks have rescheduld nearly 70
billion dlrs of debt, reaching agreements recently with Chile,
Venezuela and Mexico.
    Elsewhere in his speech, Baker outlined the progress
industrial nations are making in promoting moderate global
growth, low inflation and efforts to reduce massive trade
imbalances.
    He maintained world economic conditions were "continuuing to
improve" a development that would provide a positive backdrop
for debtor nations.

to recover 70,000 ounces of gold over three years, it said.
    The plant will use a chemical process called leaching to

out raising the capital of some state groups to make more money
available for their research programs.
    "We will take decisions on this shortly -- and they will be
positive," he said in a departure from a prepared text. He gave
no details and Industry Ministry officials had no immediate
comment.
    Warning that high technology exports were rapidly losing
world market share, Chirac urged private sector industry to
step up its research efforts.
    Private sector research and development spending, at 1.3
pct of Gross Domestic Product, was below the 1.8 to 1.9 pct of
GDP spent in the U.S., West Germany and Japan, he said.
    France awarded only 12,000 registered patents in 1986,
compared with 20,000 in Britain, 30,000 in West Germany, 60,000
in the U.S. And more than 200,000 in Japan, he said. In the
U.S. Market, France was awarded 2,000 patents last year,
against 6,000 awarded to German and 11,000 to Japanese firms.

<Burroughs Wellcome Co> said it has
set up a distribution system to ensure the people in most need
can get Retrovir, the first drug shown to have activity against
AIDS, during an initial period while supplies of the drug are
limited.
    At a press conference here, Paul Dreyer, the company's
product manager for the drug, said physicians must submit an
enrollment application to the company for each new patient who
is a candidate for taking the drug.
    The company is the U.S. arm of Wellcome Plc.
    The application will list several items required to
evaluate a patient. The company will inform doctors within one
week if a patient meets enrollment criteria and whether there
are sufficient amounts of the drug available.
    On Friday, the Food and Drug Administration approved the
drug for wide clinical use. The drug is not a cure for AIDS,
but it does prolong the lives of certain people with AIDS, who
have a history of certain types of pneumonia, and patients with
an advanced form of AIDS-related complex whose immune systems
have declined after infection with the virus.
    The company said it only has enough supply of the drug to
treat 15,000 patients and by the end of the year should have
enough supply to treat 30,000 patients.
    Dreyer said physicians can call 1-800-843-9388 for
information about distribution of the drug, and pharmacists can
call 1-800-322-1887 to place orders for the drug.
    Dreyer added this distribution system will end once an
adequate supply of the drug is available.
    Thomas Kennedy, vice president of corporate affairs,
declined to comment on the cost of developing the drug.
    Some organizations have criticized the high cost of the
drug, which is said to be between 7,000 and 10,000 dlrs per
year for treatment. Dreyer said it took seven months to make
the drug, and the company obtained the principal raw material
from Pfizer Inc <PFE>.
    Dryer said the company is developing other suppliers.
    The company said it spent 80 mln dlrs for the raw materials
for the drug and an undisclosed amount on research, but would
not disclose the total cost of developing Retrovir.
    Burroughs has cited the high cost of making the drug as one
of the reasons for its cost.

A report by the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) concluded that index trading was not
to blame for the two-day stock market drop that occurred Sept.
11-12, 1986
    The report, made public today, concluded that index trading
magnified but was not the cause of last fall's two-day
120-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Index.
    The commission staff said it planned to continue to closely
monitor developments in index-related trading but planned no
immediate regulatory action as a result of the precipitous
stock market decline.
    "The magnitude of the September decline was a result of
changes in investors' perceptions of fundamental economic
conditions, rather than artifical forces arising from
index-related trading strategies," the report said.
    "Nevertheless, index-related futures trading was
instrumental in the rapid transmission of these changed
investor perceptions to individual stock prices, and may have
condensed the time period in which the decline occurred."
    The SEC staff concluded its study "does not provide an
independent basis to conclude that radical regulatory or
structural changes are necessary at this time."
    The report said "the dramatic growth in the size and
institutional use of index products requires continued careful
analysis of the potential for disruption of the stock market as
well as manipulative or other inappropriate trading in the
index products and their component stocks."
    It said there "may be merit" to requiring additional
reporting and record keeping procedures for index-related
trading. But it added that the SEC staff has not yet considered
the costs and benefits of the various alternatives.
    The report does not deal with a second precipitous dip in
the market which occurred Jan. 23.
    On that day, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 115
points in little more than an hour.
    The SEC said its staff was still analyzing the underlying
causes of that price decline and had not yet made findings.
    The SEC study was made after a number of investors, news
reports and other analysts blamed the Sept. 11-12 drop on
so-called "program trading," in which computers rapidly execute
complex trading strategies designed to profit from minute
changes in the relationship between the price of stock index
futures and the stocks that make up the index.
    The investors and analysts complained that such rapid
movements in the stock market would drive small investors out
of the market and possible even lead to a stock market crash.
    But the SEC report said the possibility of a market
collapse was "remote."
    It said it believed any rapid stock price decline "likely"
would eventually be reversed by renewed buying as prices
reached far lower levels.
    It also argued that index futures and options are important
to traders who use them to hedge their market positions and
lessen risk exposure.
    "While a 'cascade effect' may be possible as a result of
index-related trading, it did not ocur on Sept. 11 and 12," the
report concluded.

Texaco Inc said it has filed
a motion with the Texas Court of Appeals to supplement the
court record with new evidence it has just received of alleged
bias by Judge Anthony J.P. Farris against Texaco and its chief
trial lawyer in its litigation with Pennzoil Co <PZL>.
    The company contended that the alleged bias provides clear
grounds for a new trial. It said the motion was filed in
connection with its appeal of the Pennzoil judgment pending in
that court.
    Texaco said the motion introduces two letters written by
Farris, who has since died, to two Houston lawyers in late
1984, after he had been assigned the case but before the trial
began.
    The company alleged that Farris harbored personal animosity
against Texaco and its chief trial lawyer, Richard B. Miller,
due to an earlier motion to have Farris disqualified from the
case. The motion was filed due to Farris' acceptance of a
10,000 dlr campaign contribution from Pennzoil's chief trial
lawyer, Joseph P. Jamail, shortly after the case was assigned
to him, Texaco said.
    In February the Texas Appellate Court refused to grant
Texaco a new trial, finding no evidence that Farris was biased.
    Texaco said it is preparing its application for a rehearing
on the merits of its case before the Texas Appelate Court, and
the application will be filed on March 30.
    The company said it will ask the court to reconsider its
decision on the issue of due process in light of the Farris
letters.
    In the suit, Pennzoil has been awarded about 10.53 billion
dlrs in damages from Texaco in connection with Pennzoil's
proposed merger with Getty Oil Co, which was later taken over
by Texaco. Texaco is appealing the ruling.
    A Texaco spokeswoman said the company had known of the
letters for some time but were unable to release them until now
due to understandings of confidentiality with the attorneys
from which they were secured.

American Telephone and Telegraph Co is
another illustration of a maxim already learned by several
other huge corporations - that success in one segment of the
electronics industry is very difficult to translate into
success selling computers.
    ATT is learning the hard way that all the resources and
technological advances in the world can not make up for weak
marketing and sluggish responses to one of the most rapidly
changing and competitive industries.
    Consequently, ATT will try again this week to convince the
world that it is serious about computers, after four years in
the business, by announcing a set of new products and
showcasing its latest computer chief, Vittorio Cassoni,
formerly of ATT's Italian affiliate Ing. C. Olivetti and Co.
    Industry consultants said ATT will announce a faster
addition to its 3B line of minicomputers, improved connectivity
products, a new version of its Unix software operating system
and assortered peripheral equipment, including a laser printer.
    The announcements, however, hold "minimal significance" for
both ATT and the industry, said Forrester Research consultant
John McCarthy. "They are just never going to be a significant
player in this market as long as computers play a subjagated
role to the (telephone) network," he said.
    ATT, the world's largest company before its breakup in 1984
and still the pre-eminent phone company in the United States,
has only been able to carve out a fractional share of the
computer industry.
    Last year was particularly disastrous for the company's
data systems division, which posted a pre-tax operating loss
for the year of 1.2 billion dlrs (ATT as a whole reported a
1986 profit of 139 mln, after a 1.7 billion dlr charge against
earnings, down from 1.56 billion dlrs the prior year).
    Morale is down throughout the company after ATT reduced its
work force by 32,000 people last year, leaving a work force of
290,000, but analysts say the situation in the computer
division is particularly bad, especially since the computer
merged its computer and network sales forces.
    Meanwhile, the company's most successful product, the 6300
personal computer, ran out of steam in the last three months of
the year after gaining some five pct of the market.
    "ATT seemed to lose their focus with the 6300," said
consultant Norman DeWitt, president of Dataquest Inc. "There
were no major product enhancements last year and a perception
developed in the marketplace that the product was tired."
    Meanwhile, the 6300 had to face increasingly aggressive
competition from smaller companies that undercut ATT on price
and offered more technologically advanced machines. "I would
have to say that, after a fast start, ATT just lost momentum on
the pc side," said DeWitt.
    The 3B line of minicomputers has never found great
acceptance in the market and ATT's Unix operating system,
though loved by scientists and engineers, has yet to put a
serious dent in the much more widely used systems adopted by
industry giant International Business Machines Corp <IBM>.
    By last fall, ATT executives found themselves trying to
defuse widespread speculation that ATT was going to abandon or
sell off the computer division and the company turned over all
responsibility for personal computers to Olivetti, in which its
owns a 23.5 pct stake.
    But analysts said the company's image was dealt another
blow last week when ATT senior vice president James Edwards,
who preceded Cassoni as head of the computer division,
announced he was leaving to become president of TelWatch Inc, a
small developer of systems to manage networks.
    Several other executives have also left in recent months,
including John Walsh, head of the 3B minicomputer line. And,
although the 43-year old Cassoni has considerable experience
running Olivetti's successful computer operations, analysts
expressed concern about his approach to ATT's business.
    Cassoni has said he wants to acheive recognizable success
in both within ATT and in the marketplace within two years and
it is widely assumed that he will rapidly abandon any product
that does not meet those profitability goals.
     The problem with such a strategy, analysts said, is that
it may not give certain products enough time to become
established and customers may be reluctant to buy a product
that could be discontinued in a year or two.
    ATT chairman James Olson took a slightly more conservative
view of the computer division recently. He lauded Cassoni's two
year goal but said he expects the data systems division to turn
around within five years.
    Olson denied the perception that ATT was retreating "to the
womb, going back to our old business" of long distance
telephone systems at the expense of the computer division.

Takeover speculation buoyed Wendy's
International Inc's stock, even after Coca Cola Co took the
fizz out of market rumors by denying it was an interested
suitor.
    Wendy's retreated from an earlier high of 13-3/8, and lost
a point when Coca Cola <KO> said the rumors were untrue.
However, Wendy's remained up 5/8 at 12-3/8 on volume of more
than three mln shares.
    Several analysts were skeptical of the rumors, yet they
said they could not conclude a takeover of the fast food
restaurant chain was impossible.
    Wendy's declined comment on takeover rumors of all kinds.
Yet, a Wendy's spokesman said the company was aware of a
Business Week article, which named Coke as a potential suitor
and which market sources said helped ignite the rumor mill.
    Market sources mentioned Anheuser-Busch Inc <BUD> and
Pepsico Inc <PEP> as alternatives to Coke as acquirers. Neither
of those companies would comment, nor would the Wendy's
official.
    "It doesn't happen every day, every week, every month, but
its not unusual for us to be linked with those companies," said
Denny Lynch, Wendy's vice president of communications.
    However, Lynch would not comment specifically on the
current market rumors.
    Even before Coke denied the rumors, analysts had been
skeptical of a takeover since Atlanta-based Coke has stated it
views fast food chains as customers and does not want to become
a competitor to them.
    "I can't put another name on it," said Kidder peabody
analyst Jay Freedman as vaguer rumors continued to hold up
Wendy's stock. "It very well could be someone's interested."
    But Freedman said he doesn't believe now is the right time
for Wendy's to be sold.
    "They're obviously having operational difficulties. I've
always believed at the right price Wendy's would consider (an
offer), but I can't believe this is the right price at the
right time," Freedman said.
    "If a transaction takes place, the buyer's going to control
the situation," Freedman said.
    "I just don't think there's anything going on. I don't
think it's worth much more than where it is," said Joseph Doyle
of Smith Barney.
    Analysts said Wendy's has suffered largely from the "burger
wars" between itself, McDonald's Corp <MCD> and Pillsbury Co's
<PSY> Burger King chain. Wendy's, the third largest fast food
hamburger chain in the U.S., lost about 11 pct in same store
sales last year, analysts said.
    Wendy's also fumbled when it introduced a high-priced
breakfast, which it has since withdrawn, analysts said. Some
analysts said the company should be bringing in new products,
but it is too soon to predict a significant turnaround.
    There are analysts, however, who believe Wendy's may be
vulnerable to a takeover.
    James Murren of C.J. Lawrence said Wendy's could be worth
14 to 15 dlrs on a break-up basis. He said the company has
improved its debt-to-equity ratio and Wendy's owns a high
percent of its own restaurants - 38 pct of 3,500.
    "They also have some attractive leaseholds on their
restaurants," Murren said.
    Murren said that despite the downturn in sales last year,
Wendy's real sales, store for store, turned upwards in the
fourth quarter. "That was about the first time in seven
quarters," he said.
    Caroline Levy of E.F. Hutton also believes something could
be going on with Wendy's. "My gut feeling is something's going
to happen. I don't know what," she said.
    She estimated a takeover price would be at least 15 dlrs
per share.
    One analyst speculated that Coke became the rumored suitor
because Wendy's decided to sell Coke at its fountains instead
of Pepsi.
    Wendy's is currently embroiled in litigation brought by
Pepsi, which holds a contract with the company, analysts said.
Pepsi's soda is still sold in the Wendy's restaurants.

West Germany's banking authorities
are being drawn into the currency scandal surrounding
Volkswagen AG <VOWG.F> as the repercussions and allegations in
the financial community widen, banking sources said.
    The Bundesbank has seconded one of its currency experts to
help the state prosecutor investigating the currency fraud at
Volkswagen, VW, in Brunswick, a Bundesbank spokesman said.
    The Federal Banking Supervisory Office in West Berlin also
is considering press allegations that several banks "parked" open
positions with VW, breaching banking regulations.
    Earlier this month Volkswagen said it had incurred
potential losses of 480 mln marks in an alleged fraud involving
the hedging of open currency positions.
    The foreign exchange activities of a large non-bank
corporation would not normally attract the attention of West
German banking regulators.
    Their strict foreign exchange rules, set up after the
Herstatt banking crash in 1974, apply only to banks.
    "This strict banking supervision aims to protect special
interests -- creditors and depositors," the Bundesbank spokesman
said, adding company shareholders were not covered.
    "The Volkswagen case, in so far as it involves Volkswagen's
normal foreign exchange business, lies far outside the area of
the Bundesbank," he said.
    The Bundesbank's decision to send a currency expert to
Brunswick to help investigations into activities involving
Volkswagen's foreign exchange dealing room was part of the
normal assistance rendered by one public authority to another.
    The expert will count as part of the state prosecutor's
staff and not report back to the Bundesbank, he said.
    But the Bundesbank could get more closely involved in
allegations that banks used VW to circumvent regulations.
    Section 1a of the Banking Law requires banks at the close
of business each day to hold no more than 30 pct of their
capital and reserves in open positions.
    The section was introduced after the Herstatt bank crash in
1974 due to currency speculation.
    The Platow Brief financial newsletter said on Friday that
about 16 banks, mainly foreign, had been circumventing section
1a by "parking" such excess open positions with VW.
    This would mean that the bank concerned would sell the
position temporarily to VW, buying it back a day or so later.
    However, such repurchase agreements are expressly included
in section 1a as still counting as open positions.
    A spokesman for the Federal Banking Supervisory Office in
West Berlin said it was following the allegations but
investigations were difficult because the 16 banks had not been
named. He declined to say what steps were being taken.
    But banking sources said the Supervisory Office as an
initial step had approached the Platow Brief for the identity
of the banks, but this had been refused. The Platow Brief
declined comment.
    If the Supervisory Office ascertains that the banking
regulations have been infringed, it will pursue the case with
the assistance of the Bundesbank.
    The Office, subordinate to the Finance Ministry, does not
have branches outside Berlin.
    The independent Bundesbank however operates 203 branches in
West Germany, closely monitoring local banks.
    Banks deposit statistics, including currency position data,
once a month with the Bundesbank's regional administrations at
federal state level, the Landeszentralbanken (LZBs).
    Currency dealers said parking excess positions with
non-banking corporates was frequent practice.
    Such positions would often be sold for tomorrow/next
delivery, with a verbal agreement to buy it back the next day
at the same rate.
    A VW spokesman said it was company policy not to undertake
currency hedging but he confirmed that arbitrage was allowed.
    He declined to estimate the volume of currency arbitraging.
German press reports have put it at 80 billion marks a year.
    The spokesman declined to comment on how it would have been
possible to carry out a fraud involving currency hedging given
the company's policy not to conduct this kind of business.
    VW finance director Rolf Selowsky accepted responsibility
and resigned. VW has suspended six other officials and fired
its former foreign exchange chief, Burkhard "Bobby" Junger.
    Management board chief Carl Hahn told a ceremony today
marking VW's 50 millionth vehicle that personnel changes did
not mean any of those involved was guilty.

France's Societe Generale <SGEN.PA> bank,
which will be sold to the private sector in the second half of
this year, reported increased profits for last year.
    Societe Generale, one of the three largest state-owned
banking groups, said in a statement that its parent company
profit for 1986 totalled 800 mln francs, up 21.2 pct on 1985's
660 mln profit.
    This was in line with earlier forecasts of profit of
between 770 and 800 mln francs.
    The bank's parent company gross operating profits were up
5.4 pct at 21.34 billion francs against 20.24 billion in 1985.
    The increase in the bank's gross operating profits was
mostly due to a rise in french franc deposits and personal
loans as well as the development of its financial activities,
Societe Generale said.
    Parent company net banking earnings last year were also up

Energy analyst Edward Krapels said
the United States should consider an oil tariff to keep U.S.
dependence on imports below 50 pct.
    "On the supply side, the argument in favor of a contingent,
variable import tariff is most persuasive," Krapels, president
of Energy Security Analysis, Inc said in a statement at a House
Energy and Power subcommittee hearing.
    "An optimal tariff would be one implemented only if the
international price of crude oil falls below, say, 15 dlrs a
barrel. On the demand side, the obvious policy is an excise tax
on transportation fuels," Krapels said.
    But William Johnson of the Jofree Corp disagreed with the
oil tariff proposal, saying Congress should remove price
controls on natural gas, repeal the windfall profits tax on oil
companies, allow exports of Alaskan oil and provide tax
incentives for U.S. oil production, or, at the least, preserve
exisiting tax incentives for drilling. He also urging filling

A.H. Robins Co said it filed a
motion in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Richmond seeking to 
establish an orderly procedure to determine the number of valid
Dalkon Shield claims that must be dealt with in the company's
Chapter 11 case.
    The order would prescribe procedures for the filing and
disposition of objections to certain claims, it said.
    Robins said that 200,000 of the 327,000 claims it has
received should be disallowed.
    Robins said the claims are invalid because they are
duplicates, the claimant is claiming injury from a product
other than the Dalkon shield, claimants did not complete
court-required questionnaires by June 30, 1986, or the claims
were made beyond the April 30, 1986 deadline.
    Robins has sought bankruptcy protection since August 1985
following a flood of lawsuits relating to its intrauterine
Dalkon Shield, alleged to have caused uterine perforations,
sterility, spontaneous abortions and death.
     About 3.3 mln of the shields were sold in over 80
countries between 1971 and 1974, including 2.2 mln in the U.S.
before it was withdrawn from the market.
    A spokesman said Robins has been told to withhold refilng a
reorganization plan pending the determination by a
court-appointed examiner whether other parties are interested
in acquiring Robins.
    It had intended to file a plan in February, but received a
purchase bid which was later withdrawn from American Home
Products Corp.
    American Home products never disclosed details of the
proposed acquisition bid but analysts speculated that American
Home would provide about 1.5 billion dlrs for a separate trust
fund to handle the liability claims.
    Robins said that establishing a procedure for identifying
invalid claims is vital to establishing a plan of
reorganization.

A federal judge and a former U.S.
senator are among the top contenders to replace John Shad as
chairman of the federal Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC), government sources said.
    Also on the list of possible replacements are two current
SEC commissioners, said the sources who asked not to be named.
    Last week the White House said it would name Shad U.S.
ambassador to the Netherlands. Among those most frequently
placed on the short list of Shad's possible successors were
Kevin Duffy, a New York federal judge, and Nicholas Brady, who
served about eight months in the Senate in 1981.
    Brady, currently a managing partner with the New York
investment banking firm of Dillon, Read and Co Inc, was an
interim replacement for Sen. Harrison Williams (D-N.J.) after
Williams resigned in a congressional bribery scandal. Duffy was
SEC New York regional administrator during 1969-72.
    However, congressional sources speculated Brady may be
unwilling to take the SEC post because he is active in Vice
President George Bush's presidential campaign.
    The SEC commissioners said to be possible replacements for
Shad are Charles Cox and Edward Fleischman.
    Fleischman was a New York securities lawyer before his SEC
appointment while Cox was the commission's chief economist.
    Sen. William Proxmire, the Wisconsin Democrat whose Senate
Banking Committee would hold confirmation hearings on the new
chairman, said he hoped that Shad's successor "would be very
supportive of the division of enforcement's on-going
investigation of the scandals on Wall Street and would be
someone who did not come directly from the industry."
    The White House said on Friday it would nominate Shad, 63,

International Business Machines Corp,
hit by a two-year earnings slump, should begin a come-back by
the end of 1987 and post strong growth in 1988, analyst Rick
Martin of Sanford C. Bernstein Co Inc said.
    "There will be increasing momentum in earnings, albeit not
until later this year," Martin said at a technology conference
sponsored by the investment firm.
    Martin said the coming rebound reflects new product
introductions in the mid-range area, rather than any drastic
improvement in economic growth or U.S. capital spending.
    IBM, whose stock hit a 52-week low of 115-3/4 dlrs in
mid-January, has come back lately. IBM was trading up 7/8 at
149-1/2 dlrs.
    Analysts, computer industry executives, and the company
itself, have highlighted the external economic factors
hampering IBM's growth.
    But Martin said the product cycle was key to understanding
the rise and fall of IBM and other computer companies, and
pointed to Digital Equipment Corp <DEC> to support his view.
"By replacing the product line, earnings have soared," he said
of DEC's line of VAX computers.
    In contrast to DEC, IBM faultered with an incompatible
mid-range product line. A new computer code-named "Fort Knox"
was supposed to tie together a number of IBM's mid-range
systems, but the product never got off the ground, he said.
    Instead, aspects of the computer were integrated into the
IBM 9370 machine introduced last year, and other aspects should
be unwrapped by 1988, Martin said. "The major story will be a
rebound in its mid-range business."
    He said sales of IBM's mid-range computers fell about 13
pct in 1986. But the new products will lead to 5.8 pct growth
in mid-range computers this year and 30.7 pct growth in 1988.
    High-end computers, primarily the Sierra line, are coming
to the end of their product life cycle. Although growing 22.5
pct in the midst of IBM's sharply lower 1986 year, growth will
drop to 1.5 pct in 1987 and 1.9 pct in 1988, he said.
    By 1988, overall revenue growth should rise to about 16
pct, against 5.8 pct growth in 1987 and 2.4 pct in 1986, Martin
said. Last year, IBM earned 4.8 billion dlrs on revenues of
51.3 billion dlrs.
    Investors asked what this all meant to DEC, whose earnings
and stock have been propelled by a strong slew of product
introductions in the mid-range area.
    In response, Martin said he did not view IBM as a threat to
DEC, nor DEC as a threat to IBM, because both companies were
catering largely to existing customer bases, rather than
stealing market share from one another.

Brunswick Corp expects 1987 first
quarter sales to be up "dramatically" and profits to "do well,"
chairman and president Jack Reichert said after a securities
analysts meeting.
    He declined to be more specific.
    In the 1986 first quarter, Brunswick reported earnings of
23.8 mln dlrs or 57 cts a share on sales of 396.7 mln dlrs.
    Reichart noted that results of its two newly-acquired boat
manufacturing companies will be included in the company's first
quarter report.
    Brunswick expects its recreation centers to benefit from
increased attention to the sport of bowling resulting from
acceptance in the 1988 Summer Olympics of bowling as an
exhibition sport and as a medal sport in the 1991 Pan American
Games, he said.
    He said field testing of a new bowling concept involving
electronic features is being readied for test marketing this
summer, and if successful, could "materially benefit"
operations.
    Brunswick is currently test marketing in California a
health club facility adjoining a bowling center, he said.
    Turning to its defense operations, Reichert said he expects
the division to receive significant contracts in the near
future. At 1986 year end, Brunswick's defense contract backlog
stood at 425 mln dlrs.
    Frederick Florjancic, vice president-finance, told analysts
Brunswick was disappointed two credit rating services recently
downgraded the company's debt which stood at about 665.4 mln
dlrs at 1986 year end.
    "We are confident we can service our debt and bring it down
in the very near term," based on strong cash flow from
Brunswick's expanded boat operations, Florjancic said.
    Shareholders at the company's April 27 annual shareholders
meeting will be asked to approve an increase in the authorized
common shares outstanding to 200 mln from 100 mln shares, a

Congress should give the U.S.
Agriculture Secretary the authority to keep the 1987 soybean
loan rate at the current effective rate of 4.56 dlrs per bushel
in order to help resolve the problem of soybean export
competitiveness, USDA undersecretary Dan Amstutz said.
    Speaking to reporters following a Senate Agriculture
Appropriations hearing, Amstutz suggested that one way out of
the current soybean program "dilemma" would be for Congress to
allow the loan rate to remain at 4.56 dlrs. He indicated if the
loan rate were 4.56 dlrs, USDA could then consider ways to make
U.S. soybeans more competitive such as using certificates to
further buydown the loan rate.
    Under current law, the 1987 soybean loan rate cannot be
less than 4.77 dlrs per bu.
    Amstutz' suggestion would be for Congress to change the
farm bill to allow USDA to leave the soybean loan rate at 4.56
dlrs in crop year 1987 rather than increase it to 4.77 dlrs.
    The 1986 effective loan rate is 4.56 dlrs because of the
4.3 pct Gramm-Rudman budget cut.
    Amstutz stressed that a major factor in any decision on
soybean program changes will be the budget costs.
    He told the hearing that the problem in soybeans is that
the U.S. loan rate provides an "umbrella" to foreign production
and causes competitive problems for U.S. soybeans.
    Asked about the American Soybean Association's request for
some form of income support, Amstutz said "the competitive
problem is the most severe." He said USDA is still studying the
situation and "no resolution" has yet been found.

Canada's Minister of State for Finance,
Tom Hockin, said substantial progress was made today with his
provincial counterparts on deregulation of the country's
financial system, but stumbling blocks remain.
    "We were able to make considerable headway," Hockin told
reporters following a six-hour meeting with provincial
ministers responsible for financial institutions.
    Hockin said he was optimistic an agreement could be reached
by the June 30 deadline to bring the sweeping new system in
place, but he was willing to extend it if necessary.
    Under the proposed system the traditional barriers
separating the banking, securities and life insurance sectors
will be removed and, for the first time, cross ownership will
be allowed.
    But a jurisdictional dispute over who regulates the new
institutions has broken out between the provinces and Ottawa.
The provinces have traditionally had authority over securities
while Ottawa held sway over banking.
    Hockin, without giving details, said under the new system
the regulatory system would have to be harmonized to "insure
orderly and efficient markets."
    Hockin said he made it clear to the provinces that Ottawa
has jurisdiction in any international accords in the financial
sector and would not allow any intrusion by the provinces in
that area.
    Hockin said the ministers did not have time to go into
detail on all the issues and the talks would continue the rest
of this week at the official level.

U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker said
leading Latin American nations have delayed accepting a U.S.
compromise proposal on major reforms of the Inter-American
Development Bank.
    In an interview with a small group of reporters, Baker said
discussions on far-reaching reforms of the bank would resume
around the fringes of the semiannual meeting of the
International Monetary Fund in two weeks time.
    But Baker said his compromise proposal, which he would not
disclose, was no longer on the table.
    "I made it clear that the proposal was not one that I
expected to leave out there if we could not resolve it at this
meeting," Baker said.
    The U.S. had pressed for virtual veto power over IADB loans
which were made on terms Washington considers far too lax.
    In a bid to integrate the Bank into the U.S. debt strategy,
Washington has suggested it would be ready to subscribe nine
billion dlrs to a new four-year capital replenishment of the
Bank.
    In return Latin nations would have to give up their 54 pct
simple majority voting power over IADB lending.
    Baker said, "In my view, they have not rejected it out of
hand at all and that it will be considered, should we choose to
advance it at the April meeting."
    A U.S. contribution of that size would lead to an effective
four-year lending program by the Bank of 22.9 billion dlrs.
    The actual capital increase would amount to 27 billion
dlrs, but usable resources would be less because the callable
capital of Latin debtors is theoretical and does not take place
in practice, U.S. officials explained.
    In return Latin nations would have to give up their 54 pct
simple majority voting power over IADB lending.
    Initially, the U.S. wanted 65 pct of votes to proceed with
a loan, a position that would have given the U.S. a virtual
veto since it holds almost 35 pct of the votes.
    But it seemed clear from Baker's remarks he was at one
point ready to concede an increased voting power, such as 62.5
pct or 60 pct as the majority for approving loans, that would
amount to a compromise between the original U.S. and Latin
American positions.
    Baker said, "In my view, they have not rejected it out of
hand at all and that it will be considered, should we choose to
advance it at the April meeting."
    Baker made clear that since Mexico, Brazil, Venezuela and
Argentina, representing the Latins, had declined to accept the
plan today, the U.S. had reverted to its original position, but
he added, "It's possible the proposal could be revived."
    U.S. officials, who asked not to be named, said they
believed a decision was not forthcoming because several top
Latin finance officials were absent from the IADB annual
meetings here.
    And one official added that the key Latin officials would
be present at the semi-annual meetings of the IMF and the World
Bank.
    The Treasury Secretary warned that if the issue is left
unresolved "we can't look towards a greater (capital)
replenishment here."
    That would mean the U.S. would use another multilateral
development bank, like the World Bank, as its principal vehicle
for lending tied to fundamental economic reforms in debtor
nations.
    The IADB has tended to make loans for projects rather than
sectoral loans aimed at reforming Latin economies and hence has
never fully participated in Baker's third world debt plan.

American Express Co said its board
approved a public offering of about 18 pct of its wholly owned
Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc brokerage unit.
    American Express also approved the previously announced
plan to sell about 13 pct, or 13 mln convertible preferred, of
the unit to Nippon Life insurance co for 538 mln dlrs. The
preferred shares are convertible to the same number of common
shares following Hart-Scott-Rodino and FDIC approvals.
    American Express said it will maintain 60 pct, or 60 mln of
the 100 mln shares of Shearson that will be outstanding.
    American Express said it had agreed with Nippon life that
American Express will hold a minimum of 40 pct of Shearson
until January, 1999.
   American Express said 7.5 mln Shearson shares would be held
by certain employees of Shearson and one mln by a Shearson
stock ownership plan to be formed.
    American Express said it anticipates a registration
statement for the public offering will be filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission shortly.
    American Express also declared a two-for-one stock split
and raised its quarterly dividend to 38 cts per share from 36
cts on a pre-split basis. Both dividends are payable May 8, to
shareholders of record April 3. There are currently 215 mln
American Express shares outstanding.
    The transaction with Nippon Life remains subject to
approval by the Japanese ministry of finance, which is expected
in April.
    American Express also said an agreement was reached by
Shearson and Nippon Life providing for a joint venture in
London.
    The venture will focus on investment advisory asset
management, market research and consulting on financing. It
also said it expects the relationship to extend to selected
projects involving American Express, Shearson Lehman and Nippon
Life in key financial centers of Asia and other regions, and to
future personnel exchanges.
    Under the agreement, Nippon will receive 13 mln cumulative
preferred shares with a five pct dividend rate. The cumulative
preferred stock will become convertible with voting powers to
an equal number of common shares following the U.S. government
approvals.
    American Express said that assuming conversion of the
preferred stock held by Nippon, 100 mln shares of Shearson
Lehman common stock would be outstanding. For the public
offering, it said there will be an underwriters overallotment
option to purchase 1.8 mln shares.
    American Express will also grant Nippon Life a five-year
warrant to purchase one mln American Express common shares at
100 dlrs per share. There are currently 215 mln American
Express shares outstanding.
    Nippon Life would be entitled to nominate two directors to
the Shearson board and one representative to serve as an
adviser to the American Express board of directors.
    "These proposed transactions are yet another signal that
american express intends to stay in the forefront of the
financial services industry worldwide," said American Express
Chairman James D. Robinson. "The implementation of our plans,
moreover, will enable us to maintain a majority interest in
shearson while enhancing the strength of our balance sheet by
tapping additional capital resources for shearson outside
american express."

Britain has reaped profits by using a
stronger pound to buy back dollars used by the government last
autumn to support sterling during a currency crisis, Chancellor
of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said.
    He said in a parliamentary debate, "I can now tell the House
(of Commons) that the dollars that were sold from the reserves
in September and October (1986) have subsequently all been
repurchased - at a profit of some tens of millions of pounds."
    Hindsight had proved him right to resist market pressures
then for a two percentage point interest rate rise, he said.
The increase in base rates was instead limited then to one
point.
    During a debate on the 1987/88 British budget which Lawson
unveiled last week, he said that "during the period of foreign
exchange market turbulence which followed the somewhat
inconclusive Group of Five and Group of Seven meetings at the
end of September, I authorised the Bank of England to intervene
unusually heavily in order to buy breathing space that would
enable me to confine the interest rate rise to one pct rather
than the two pct the market was then pressing for."
    He said that that one percentage point increase, effected
in October 1986, had been reversed by this month's two half
point cuts in banks' base lending rates. They are now at 10
pct.
    Treasury figures show that the underlying change in British
reserves - seen as a guide to possible Bank of England
intervention on foreign exchange markets - suggest that the
authorities sold around 1.0 billion dlrs during September and
October 1986, government sources said.

British manufacturers expect output to
grow rapidly in the four coming months, a Confederation of
British Industry (CBI) survey shows.
    The CBI's monthly trends survey for March shows that 43 pct
of the 1,685 polled U.K. Firms expect to raise output in the
next four months. Only nine pct expect output to fall while 47
pct said production would likely remain unchanged.
    The CBI said the positive balance between firms expecting
production to rise and those forecasting a fall, at 34 pct, was
the highest such figure recorded since 1977.
    In the CBI's February survey, 37 pct of companies expected
a rise in output while 54 pct forecast production would remain
at present levels and eight pct expected production to drop.
    The survey also showed that 23 pct of the polled companies
consider current order books to be above normal while 58 pct
view them as normal and only 19 pct regard them as below
normal.
    This was the highest positive balance since the question
was first asked more than 10 years ago, the CBI said.
    In February, the figures were 24 pct, 22 pct and 54 pct
respectively.
    Companies also rated their export possibilities higher. Of
all polled companies, 23 pct rated their export order books to
be above normal and 53 pct described them as normal while only
23 pct believed export orders were below normal levels.
    In February, 25 pct thought their export books were below
normal and 50 pct believed them to be about normal. At 23 pct,
the proportion of companies rating their export books above
normal was unchanged between February and March.
    On prices, the survey showed that 62 pct of companies
expect average prices at which domestic orders are booked will
remain unchanged in the coming four months, up from 57 pct in
February.
    From 38 pct in February, only 31 pct of firms now expect
prices to rise before July. Six pct forecast prices will fall,
against four pct a month earlier.
    Commenting on the survey, CBI economic situation committee
chairman David Wigglesworth said sterling's more competitive
level against many European currencies had improved exports.
    "But interest rates are still much higher than in our
competitor countries and British manufacturers will still have
to work hard to win new business both in overseas markets and
in the substitution of British-made goods for imports here at
home," he said.

Research into materials that conduct
electricity with minimal resistance could lead to further gains
on Tokyo's booming stock market, brokers said.
    They said the share prices of companies likely to benefit
from the so-called 'superconductors' rose sharply last week
after publication of articles about the research in the
economic daily Nihon Keizai Shimbun. The companies were in the
non-ferrous metal, electrical and mining sectors.
    But industry analysts said development problems remain and
commercial application is still some years away.
    "The area clearly has significant applications but it won't
be commercially viable for a few years," said Thomas Murtha,
technology analyst with James Capel and Co.
    Industry analysts said the use of superconductors could
bring sharp cuts in electricity costs if present problems can
be overcome.
    Nikko Securities Co Ltd analyst Shinichi Nakayama said
superconductors could have applications in computer circuitry,
electricity generation and storage, and scientific research.
    The superconductors are made of a blend of metals fused in
a heat-firing process similar to that used in ceramics.
    Nakayama said Kawasaki Steel Corp <KAWS.T> predicted in an
in-house study that by 1990 the worldwide market would be worth
150 billion yen for superconductors used in computers, 50
billion for those used in electricity generators and 150
billion for those used in electricity storage.
    The study said that by 1995 there would be trains capable
of 500 km an hour, hovering on a magnetic field and powered
mainly by superconductors. One hundred billion yen worth of
superconducting material would be needed for such a train.
    The Kawasaki study also said superconductors would be used
in nuclear fusion physics, but not until the year 2000.
    Industry analysts said superconductors have no commercial
applications at present. In laboratory tests the conductor must
be cooled by expensive liquid helium or hydrogen before minimum
electrical resistance is achieved, though liquid nitrogen,
which is much less expensive, has recently also been used
successfully, they said.
    Despite this, investors on Tokyo's stock market have
boosted shares of firms related to superconducting materials.
    From the close of trading on March 17 until yesterday's
close, Mitsubishi Mining and Cement Co Ltd's <MIMI.T> share
price rose 140 yen to 485 yen.
    In the same period Mitsubishi Metal Corp <MITM.T>, rose 95
to 745 yen, Sumitomo Metal Mining Co Ltd <TOMM.T> rose 200 to
1440 yen, and Kawasaki Steel rose 15 to 260.
    Furukawa Electric Co Ltd shares <URUT.T> jumped 104 yen to
689 yen, and Fuji Electric Co Ltd <FUJE.T> rose 141 to 619.
    Brokers said shares of suppliers of scientific instruments
needed to conduct the superconductor research also rose.
    Industry analysts said the most favoured superconductor,
made from a blend of yttrium, barium and copper, is currently
undergoing laboratory tests under a scheme coordinated by the
Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI).

Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita
said in a statement the central bank will intervene in foreign
exchange markets to stabilise exchange rates if necessary in
close cooperation with other major industrial nations.
    Sumita said the Bank will take adequate measures including
market intervention, if necessary, in line with the February 22
Paris agreement by six major industrial nations.
    Canada, Britain, France, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany
agreed to cooperate in stabilising exchange rates around
current levels. Sumita's statement was issued after the dollar
slipped below 150 yen to hit a record low of 148.40.
    "It is inevitable that exchange rates fluctuate under the
system of floating rates," Sumita said.
    The fact the dollar plunged below 150 yen does not mean
anything significant under the floating system, he said.
    The six nations agreed in Paris exchange rates prevailing
then were broadly consistent with underlying economic
fundamentals and further substantial rate shifts could damage
growth and adjustment prospects in their countries, the Paris
statement said.

Industrial holding company Williams
Holdings Plc said it was bidding 542.2 mln stg for the ordinary
shares of building products and packaging group Norcros Plc.
    The offer would be made on the basis of 29 new Williams
shares for every 50 in Norcros, or 432.7p a share
    Norcros shares firmed to 410p at 0914 GMT from a close last
night of 397p.
    A statement by Williams said it was confident of the merits
of the proposed merger and it had therefore taken care to
propose from the outset the right terms, including a full cash
alternative.
    The offer will include a partial convertible alternative
under which shareholders would receive up to a total of 205.69
mln new second convertible shares in Williams instead of their
ordinary share allocations.
    The offer for Norcros preferential shares offers one
Williams preferential share for each one of Norcros, for a
value of 130p each and a total of 2.9 mln stg.
    Last week Williams reported that pretax profits for 1986
rose to 22.9 mln stg from 6.3 mln.
    Speculation about a bid for Norcros had been circulating in
the market for several months, dealers said. Initially it
centred on <Bunzl Plc>, which once held a 2.6 pct stake, then
switched to Williams when it began accumulating shares.
    Earlier this year, Williams suggested holding talks with
Norcros on a possible merger but was rebuffed by Norcros which
replied that any benefits that could be achieved could also
result from normal trading.
    In the six months to end-September, Norcros reported a rise
in pretax profits to 20.14 mln stg from 18.55 mln on turnover
that lifted to 311.82 mln from 303.91 mln
    Williams Holdings began expanding from 1982 when it had a
market capitalisation of around one mln stg. A series of
acquisitions in the next four years has pushed its
capitalisation up to around 380 mln.
    The convertible offer would be on the basis of four
Williams convertibles for every Norcros share, worth 428p a
share. The cash alternative would offer the equivalent of
400.2p a share.
    The announcement of the bid pushed Williams share price
down to 733p from last night's close at 750p.
    Williams said it held a total 850,000 shares in Norcros, or
0.7 pct, while an associate held a further 1.99 mln or 1.6 pct.
    There was no immediate response from Norcros.

Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation
Co Plc <PORL.L>, P and O, said it plans a free warrant issue on
the basis of 10 warrants for every 150 stg nominal of deferred
stock already held, to mark the 150th anniversary of the
company.
    Each warrant will give the right to subscribe for one stg
nominal of deferred stock at 750p during a specified period in
the five years starting in 1988.
    P and O deferred shares were last quoted at 629p, down 1p
since yesterday, after the company reported 1986 pre-tax profit
of 174.1 mln stg against 125.6 mln for 1985.
    P and O said 1986 produced an acceptable level of growth,
though ground has to be made up in one or two areas.
    The company has a strong balance sheet and considerable
flexibility for 1987, it added. P and O will concentrate on
expanding in its established market sectors.
    Commenting on the recent ferry disaster in the North Sea
off Zeebrugge, the statement said the precise cause is unknown.
The company has instituted an immediate investigation and both
the British and Belgian governments are conducting inquiries.
    The stricken ferry, the Herald of Free Enterprise, belongs
to Townsend Thoresen, which became part of P and O in January.
    P and O is considering listing its shares in Japan and

Japanese private sector investment in
plant and equipment is expected to grow a real 0.9 pct in 1987,
after an estimated 5.5 pct rise last year, the Long-Term Credit
Bank of Japan Ltd said.
    It said its survey of 1,169 companies at the end of
February showed that manufacturing industry investment will
decline eight pct this year, while non-manufacturing will
increase 5.7 pct. It did not provide figures for 1986.
    The bank partly blamed the expected deline in manufacturing
investment on the uncertain outlook for demand in those
industries.
    The Long-Term Credit Bank also said that steelmaking and
shipbuilding companies are putting a squeeze on maintenance and
repair costs for their facilities and equipment.
    In non-manufacturing industry, growth in investment is
expected to be particularly marked in the wholesale and retail
store area, 12.4 pct, as new department stores and supermarkets
are built and old ones are remodelled.
    The Bank though expressed concern at a slowing of corporate
investment that would help restructure the Japanese economy and
urged government deregulation and other action to offset this.

Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita
said in a statement the central bank will intervene in foreign
exchange markets to stabilise exchange rates if necessary in
close cooperation with other major industrial nations.
    Sumita said the Bank will take adequate measures including
market intervention, if necessary, in line with the February 22
Paris agreement by six major industrial nations.
    Canada, Britain, France, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany
agreed to cooperate in stabilising exchange rates around
current levels. Sumita's statement was issued after the dollar
slipped below 150 yen to hit a record low of 148.40.
    "It is inevitable that exchange rates fluctuate under the
system of floating rates," Sumita said.
    The fact the dollar plunged below 150 yen does not mean
anything significant under the floating system, he said.
    The six nations agreed in Paris exchange rates prevailing
then were broadly consistent with underlying economic
fundamentals and further substantial rate shifts could damage
growth and adjustment prospects in their countries, the Paris
statement said.

British manufacturers expect output to
grow rapidly in the four coming months, a Confederation of
British Industry (CBI) survey shows.
    The CBI's monthly trends survey for March shows that 43 pct
of the 1,685 polled U.K. Firms expect to raise output in the
next four months. Only nine pct expect output to fall while 47
pct said production would likely remain unchanged.
    The CBI said the positive balance between firms expecting
production to rise and those forecasting a fall, at 34 pct, was
the highest such figure recorded since 1977.
    In the CBI's February survey, 37 pct of companies expected
a rise in output while 54 pct forecast production would remain
at present levels and eight pct expected production to drop.
    The survey also showed that 23 pct of the polled companies
consider current order books to be above normal while 58 pct
view them as normal and only 19 pct regard them as below
normal.
    This was the highest positive balance since the question
was first asked more than 10 years ago, the CBI said.
    In February, the figures were 24 pct, 22 pct and 54 pct
respectively.
    Companies also rated their export possibilities higher. Of
all polled companies, 23 pct rated their export order books to
be above normal and 53 pct described them as normal while only
23 pct believed export orders were below normal levels.
    In February, 25 pct thought their export books were below
normal and 50 pct believed them to be about normal. At 23 pct,
the proportion of companies rating their export books above
normal was unchanged between February and March.
    On prices, the survey showed that 62 pct of companies
expect average prices at which domestic orders are booked will
remain unchanged in the coming four months, up from 57 pct in
February.

The dollar is expected to decline further
in coming days as scepticism mounts about the effectiveness of
last month's Paris accord to stabilise currency exchange rates,
senior foreign exchange dealers said.
    Following its fall today to a record 148.40 yen, dealers
said they expect the dollar to establish a new trading range of
147 to 150 yen before the market again tries to push it down.
Behind the latest dollar fall lies the belief that last month's
accord was no longer enough to stop operators pushing the
dollar down, the dealers said.
    "The recent remark by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker
that the Paris accord did not set any target ranges for major
currencies has cast a shadow on the agreement," said Koji
Kidokoro, general manager of Mitsui Bank Ltd's treasury
division.
    He said the market interpreted this as indicating the U.S.
Would favour a weaker dollar and it had little intention of
intervening to support the currency.
    "This eliminated the widespread market caution against
possible joint central bank intervention," Kidokoro said.
    Dealers said the dollar had gathered renewed downward
momentum and that Bank of Japan intervention alone could hardly
contain a further slide in the currency.
    They said the central bank bought between one to 1.5
billion dlrs today, including direct purchases through brokers,
and yesterday it might have bought a small amount of dollars
through the U.S. Central bank in New York.
    Most dealers said they doubted the U.S. Federal Reserve
would intervene on its own account to support the dollar, but
some said this might occur if the dollar fell much below 148
yen.
    "If the dollar drops to that low level, it could reduce the
flow of foreign capital into U.S. Securities, which the
Americans don't want," said Haruya Uehara, chief money market
manager of Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corp.
    He said the dollar may return to around 152 yen next month
when corporations reduce their dollar sales after they close
their books for the 1986/87 business year ending on March 31.
    But dealers said the longer-term outlook for the dollar
remained bearish. This was due to the lacklustre performance of
the U.S. Economy, the continuing U.S. Trade deficit and
Japanese delays in announcing an economic stimulation package.
    "The Americans are getting frustrated at Japan's inertia in
stimulating its economy," said Hirozumi Tanaka, assistant
general manager of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd's international
treasury division.
    In the Paris currency accord Japan promised a package of
economic measures, after the fiscal 1987 budget was passed, to
boost domestic demand, increase imports, and thus reduce its
trade surplus. The package was expected in April, but debate on
the budget has been delayed by an opposition boycott of
parliamentary business over the proposed introduction of a
sales tax.
    In the circumstances the government had only a slim chance
of producing a meaningful economic package in the near future,
Dai-Ichi Kangyo's Tanaka said.
    Dealers said if steps are not taken to stimulate the
Japanese economy protectionist sentiment in the U.S. Congress
would grow and put more downward pressure on the dollar.

Japan's economy remains sluggish but is
beginning to show signs it may bottom out soon, the Economic
Planning Agency said in a monthly report submitted to Cabinet
ministers.
    But a bottoming out of the economy depends largely on the
yen's exchange rate trend in the immediate future, Agency
officials said.
    The officials told reporters industrial production, down
0.5 pct in January from December, is likely to turn positive in
February and to rise thereafter, raising hopes for a brighter
economic outlook.
    The Agency predicted industrial production will grow 2.5
pct in the current January/March quarter after falling 0.7 pct
in the previous quarter.
    A rise of this size would be the largest since the fourth
quarter of 1984 when industrial output rose 2.7 pct, the
officials said.
    They also said an expected upturn in exports would be a
mixed blessing as it would contribute to economic growth but
would increase the chance of trade friction.
    Japanese exports contracted five pct in February from
January but are likely to grow from March if the yen stabilizes
around current levels, the officials said.
    They predicted exports will increase by 2.3 pct in the
January/March quarter from the October/December quarter.
    "But the problem is imports are not expanding," said one
official. Imports fell by 9.4 pct in February from January.

The Bundesbank accepted bids for 6.5
billion marks at today's tender for a 28-day securities
repurchase pact at a rate of 3.80 pct, a central bank spokesman
said.
    Banks, which bid for a total 8.6 billion marks liquidity,
will be credited with the funds allocated tomorrow and must buy
back securities pledged on April 22.
    The allocation was in line with market expectations the
Bundesbank would provide more than the 3.4 billion marks
draining from this week as an earlier facility expires.
    Call money fell to 3.60/70 pct ahead of the allocation from
3.75/85 pct yesterday, dealers said.
    The excess allocation compensates for public funds leaving
the system which the Bundesbank added last week via
government-owned banks.
    However major tax payments by banks on behalf of customers
drew to a close this week, lessening the need for liquidity.
    The call money declines surprised some dealers, who
speculated it was because the Bundesbank disbursed further
government funds today. However, most said this had not
occurred.
    Banks were well stocked with liquidity, having 47.1 billion
marks in minimum reserves at the Bundesbank on Friday, up from
49.9 billion on Thursday. Average daily reserves over the first
20 days of the month fell to 52.6 billion from 53.1 billion.
For all of March, banks would be required to hold net daily

Ecolab Inc said it has started its
previously-announced tender offer for all shares of ChemLawn
Corp at 36.50 dlrs each.
    In a newspaper advertisement, the company said the offer
and withdrawal rights expire April 20 unless extended.  The
ChemLawn board has approved the tender and a merger at the same
price that is to follow.
    Ecolab said the offer is conditioned on receipt of at least
5,325,000 shares.  ChemLawn now has about 10.0 mln shares
outstanding.
    Ecolab said ChemLawn has granted it a conditional option to
buy all authorized but unissued and unreseved ChemLawn shares
at 36.50 dlrs each.  The option is exercisable in the event
that another party were to acquire 20 pct or more of ChemLawn
by means other than a tender offer for all shares at a higher
price than Ecolab is offering.
    The company said if the merger agreement is terminated
under certain circumstasnces, it will be entitled to receive 20
mln dlrs in damages from ChemLawn.
    Ecolab said officers and directors of ChemLawn have granted
it options to acquire an aggregate of 2,535,435 ChemLawn shares
or about 24.8 pct for the tender price, again unless a higher
tender were to be made by another party.
    Waste Management Inc <WMX> had originally made a hostile
tender offer of 27 dlrs per share for ChemLawn which ChemLawn
rejected as inadequate.  On Friday, Waste Management said it
would raise its bid to 35 dlrs per share.

New orders for durable goods
received by U.S. manufacturers rose 5.7 billion dlrs, or 6.0
pct, in February to 101.2 billion dlrs, the Commerce Department
said.
    Excluding defense, orders rose 3.8 pct, compared with a
revised January decline of 7.7 pct.
    In January, durable goods fell a revised 9.9 pct instead of
the previously reported 7.5 pct. Durables excluding defense
were reported originally as having fallen 9.9 pct in January.
    The Commerce Department on Monday revised orders statistics
for 1982 to 1986 to reflect more current inventory valuation
methods, and the February orders statistics are consistent with
the revisions, officials said.
    The February order increase was led by transportation
equipment, up 11.1 pct after an 18.0 pct decline in January.
    Orders for defense capital goods rose 48.9 pct to 6.9
billion dlrs, following a 38.8 pct decline in January.
    Non-defense capital goods orders fell 1.6 pct in February
to 26.3 billion dlrs after falling 8.7 pct in January, the

Woolworth Holdings Plc <WLUK.L> which
earlier announced a 1986 pre-tax profits rise of 42 pct over
1985, said its prospects for growth were very exciting.
    The profit figure of 115.3 mln stg exceeded a forecast by
some 10 pct made during the hostile bid by Dixons Group Plc
<DXNS.L> last year and the company said the results were a
major step towards the aim of making Woolworth the most
profitable retailing group in the U.K.
    It aimed to produce growth from all its businesses and look
for opportunities to acquire specialist retail businesses.
    Earlier this month the group said that tentative merger
talks with the high street pharmacist <Underwoods Plc> had been
called off and recently announced a 19.2 mln stg recommended
offer for <Charlie Browns Car Part Centres Plc>.
    The B and Q Do it Yourself centres raised sales by 31 pct
and retail profit by 37 pct, with its pretax contribution of
45.5 mln making it the largest single component.
    The company said that the improvement had been achieved by
substantial organic growth in existing stores as well as by the
opening of a further 29 new outlets and enhanced margins.
    In other sectors, the Comet electrical chain raised retail
profits by 46 pct to 17.4 mln stg, while the Woolworth chain
reported a 120 pct improvement to 38.7 mln.
    The company said its property operations would increase
substantially following the start of a joint venture deal with
developers <Rosehaugh Plc>.
    The defence costs against the 1.9 billion stg bid from
Dixons resulted in a 16.0 mln stg extraordinary charge.
    The results were 10 mln stg up on most analysts forecasts.
As a result, the group's shares rose strongly, peaking at 865p
from last night's 842p before easing to 860p at 1155 GMT.

Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita
said in a statement the central bank will intervene in foreign
exchange markets to stabilise exchange rates if necessary in
close cooperation with other major industrial nations.
    Sumita said the Bank will take adequate measures including
market intervention, if necessary, in line with the February 22
Paris agreement by six major industrial nations.
    Canada, Britain, France, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany
agreed to cooperate in stabilising exchange rates around
current levels. Sumita's statement was issued after the dollar
slipped below 150 yen to hit a record low of 148.40.
    "It is inevitable that exchange rates fluctuate under the
system of floating rates," Sumita said.
    The fact the dollar plunged below 150 yen does not mean
anything significant under the floating system, he said.
    The six nations agreed in Paris exchange rates prevailing
then were broadly consistent with underlying economic
fundamentals and further substantial rate shifts could damage
growth and adjustment prospects in their countries, the Paris
statement said.

The U.S. economy is showing some
promising signs of accelerated expansion despite the
sluggishness of the fourth quarter last year, private
economists say.
    Some of the slowness experienced in the October-December
period had been expected to spill over into the first quarter
this year, as the tax law changes that went into effect in
January slowed business and consumer spending.
    But some of the latest economic data show signs of
surprising strength in the U.S. economy, although some
economists remain cautious about the outlook.
    The Commerce Department reported today that new orders for
durable goods in February jumped by 5.7 billion dlrs, a six pct
rise, to 101.2 billion dlrs. Even excluding volatile defense
goods, durable goods orders rose a healthy 3.8 pct, the agency
said.
    The February numbers surpassed the expectations of many
financial analysts, whose predictions ranged from flat to
increases of up to five pct.
    The January/February employment statistics suggest the
Gross National Product will show a healthy rate of growth for
the first three months of this year, said Lyle Gramley, an
economist with the Mortgage Bankers Association.
    The U.S. jobless rate in February and January was 6.7 pct,
the lowest rate since March 1980. The number of new non-farm
jobs rose by 337,000 in February after a 319,000 gain in
January and a 225,000 December increase, the government said.
    The employment data suggests a GNP annual growth rate of
about three to 3.25 pct in the first quarter, said Gramley.
    Much of that will be attributed to businesses rebuilding
their inventories and is not likely to be sustained in the
second quarter, Gramley said. He expects a slowdown in the
second quarter with smaller increases in personal consumption
and government spending. He also sees residential construction
declining mostly for multi-family housing units.
    Fidelity Bank senior economist Mickey Levy said some of the
fourth quarter slowness will continue.
    Levy predicts GNP will grow at a scant 1.5 pct rate in the
first quarter of 1987, accelerate during the second quarter and
show a brisk 4.5 pct annual rate in the third quarter.
    The key to both forecasts is a marked improvement in the
U.S. trade balance which is expected because of the decline in
the dollar's value over the last year and half.
    "The improvement will be gradual and long lasting," Levy
predicted. Most of it will be through import reduction, but at
least one-third will be due to a rise in product exports as the
prices of U.S. goods become more attractive overseas.
    The Reagan administration has predicted the trade deficit,
which soared to record levels last year, will improve this year
and the U.S. economy will grow by a respectable 3.2 pct for the
year compared with a 2.5 pct rate last year.
    As part of the effort to reduce the trade deficit, the U.S.
has been pressing West Germany and Japan to stimulate their
domestic demand for goods from the U.S. and others.
    U.S. officials believe that would help take some of the
pressure off the United States whose five years of economic
growth has been the mainstay of developing countries.
    The U.S. economy provided them with a giant market for
their goods giving them a way to earn income badly needed to
service their foreign debt.
    The government last week said the U.S. economy grew at a
modest 1.1 pct annual rate during the fourth quarter.
    There were indications of improvement in the huge imbalance
between the volume of goods imported to the United States and
those shipped abroad. The report showed a rising volume of
exports corresponding to a decline in imports despite the fact
that in current dollar terms, the U.S. trade deficit worsened
during the closing three months of 1986.
    While fourth quarter economic growth was weak, corporate
profits jumped a healthy 6.1 pct during the period, the
government said. It also reported that inflation, as measured
by the GNP price deflator, remained in check, growing a
moderate 0.7 pct in the period, the lowest rise in 19 years.
    The government also reported that consumer spending, a key
element of the five year economic recovery, jumped 1.7 pct in
February, after falling two pct in January.
    The Federal Reserve Board also reported that the
manufacturing sector, which had been one of the weaker elements
of the U.S. economy, was showing signs of recovery.
    In its latest report on current economic conditions, the
Fed said that economic activity in the various regions of the
country ranged from uneven or steady to improving.
Manufacturing activity showed signs of improvement in most
regions except Dallas where orders remained sluggish.
    Chase Econometrics Chairman Lawrence Chimerine said the
pick up in the U.S. manufacturing sector is largely due to the
drop in the dollar's value. He said he does not foresee a major
pick up in economic activity, but does not believe the economy
will slip into recession either.
    He said higher prices on imported products and wage cuts
that have helped the manufacturing sector will squeeze
consumers purchasing power.
    "That pattern is starting and will continue for a number of
years," Chimerine said. He sees economic growth hovering around
a modest two pct level for the next few years.

U.S. Department of Energy Secretary
John Herrington said he was "optimistic" about the chances of
providing a more generous depletion allowance for oil and gas
producers, but added that the plan faces strong opposition from
some members of the Reagan administration.
    Herrington, speaking to Houston oil executives at a

a 27.5 pct annual depletion allowance was "heavy and strong"
largely because of some fears that the U.S. oil industry could
eventually become as dependent on federal subsidies as the
agriculture industry.
    Herrington's proposed tax incentives for the oil industry
were issued last week after the Department of Energy released a

    In the quarter ended March 8, the group had a modest sales

A unanimous Supreme Court ruled that
oil and gas exploration can proceed on two tracts off the
Alaska coast which were leased by the federal government to
eight major oil companies.
    The ruling was an important victory for the oil companies
and the Reagan administration's controversial off-shore leasing
program and a setback for two small Alaskan villages that
challenged the leases by claiming damage to the environment.
    The administration said that the court-ordered halt in
drilling had created uncertainty over the 4.2 billion dlrs paid
for 621 leases off the shores of Alaska since December 1980.
    A federal appeals court ordered the oil companies to halt
all exploration and remove all drilling rigs from two tracts in
the Bering Sea off Alaska because of possible harm to the
subsistence needs and culture of native Eskimos.
    But the Supreme Court said the appeals court was wrong in
issuing an injunction halting exploration.
    "Here, injury to subsistence resources from exploration was
not at all probable," Justice Byron White wrote for the court.
"And on the other side of the balance of harms was the fact
that the oil companies had committed approximately 70 mln dlrs
to exploration to be conducted during the summer of 1985 which
they would have lost without chance of recovery had exploration
been enjoined," he said.
    The oil companies, Amoco Corp <AN>, ARCO, Exxon Corp <XON>,
Mobil Corp <MOB>, Sohio, Shell, Texaco Inc <TX> and Union Oil,
had said that voiding previously granted leases would result in
staggering financial losses.
    The first lease sale in 1983 involved 2.4 mln acres and
generated 318 mln dlrs while the second lease sale in 1984
covered 37 mln acres and produced 516 mln dlrs.
    Administration officials, saying the lease sales were
preceded by an intense environmental impact study, denied that
the oil and gas exploration would hurt subsistence resources.
    The Alaskan villages of Gambell and Stebbins, along with an
organization of Eskimo natives on the Yukon Delta, argued that
the drilling would hurt native hunting and fishing.

<Shell U.K. Ltd's> pre-tax profit on
exploration and production operations fell to 869 mln stg in
1986 from 2.12 billion in 1985 due to the fall in oil prices
last year, Shell U.K. Finance director Nigel Haslam said.
    But he told a press conference that due to the high
marginal tax rate on North Sea operations, the main impact of
the drop in profit was absorbed by a fall in taxation to 330
mln stg from 1.45 billion in 1985.
    The bulk of tax last year was Corporation Tax, with
Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) representing only 16 mln stg, he
said.
    As a result, post-tax profit from the exploration and
production sector fell by only 126 mln stg to 539 mln.
    Earlier, Shell U.K., a subsidiary of Royal Dutch/Shell
Group <RD.AS>, reported an overall net profit of 757 mln stg,
up from 667 mln in 1985, on sales of 6.57 billion stg against
8.81 mln.
    Shell U.K. Chairman Bob Reid said the company's crude oil
output from the North Sea was at a record 373,000 bpd in 1986,
which would almost certainly prove to be a peak for the
company. Shell expects a fall in output of around 10 pct in the
current year to around 340,000 bpd, due mainly to the decline
in output from the major Brent field, he said.
    Gas output of 5.9 billion cubic metres and natural gas
liquids output of around one mln tonnes in 1986 are expected to
be maintained in 1987, he said.
    A final decision on development of the Kittiwake and Osprey
North Sea oil fields will be made in the next 12 to 18 months,
Reid said. The Kittiwake field, originally part of the 2.5
billion stg Gannet project abandoned last year when the oil
price fell, is now estimated to cost around 350 mln stg.
    Economies on development costs for the Tern and Eider North
Sea fields, which were approved last year, have brought the
cost down to 30 to 35 pct below the original budget.
    Day to day operating costs of the exploration and
production sector had been cut 10 pct last year, and the target
is to keep costs per barrel constant.
    The company drilled 17 wells offshore, with 10 leading to
the discovery of hydrocarbons, although it is too early to
gauge the commercial viability of these discoveries, Reid said.
    Restructuring of the downstream oil sector contributed to a
profit rise to 187 mln stg in 1986 from 91 mln stg in 1985.
    Jaap Klootwijk, managing director of downstream unit <Shell
U.K. Oil>, said refining margins in the first quarter of 1987
were a "bit better than the very bad fourth quarter 1986."
    In November and December in particular, refining operations
had shown negative margins following the fall in crude and oil
product prices, he said. He expected margins to continue
generally positive over the summer, although they could dip to
become negative from time to time, depending on price
movements.
    A new catalytic cracker at Shell's Stanlow refinery will
now come on stream by the end of first quarter 1988, about five
months behind schedule, following a crane accident which
severely damaged the plant last year, he said.
    Profits from the chemicals sector rose to 33 mln stg from
11 mln after the rationalisation of the Carrington chemical
site.
    Haslam said the Budget announcement on PRT relief, by which
companies will be allowed to offset up to 10 pct of qualifying
development expenditure on certain future oil fields against
PRT, was "helpful," but rather less than had been hoped for.
    Reid said his estimate of crude oil prices this year was in
the range of 15 to 18 dlrs. If prices went much above that, he
would expect some over-production above OPEC"s official 15.8 mln
bpd output ceiling which would tend to bring prices back down.
    He said it looked as if the December OPEC pact to restrain
output was holding, bringing supply and demand into balance,
but the test will come in summer when demand for OPEC oil will
fall.

Robert Heller, a member of the Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, said commodity
prices could form a useful guide for setting domestic and
international monetary policy.
    Speaking to the conservative Heritage Foundation, Heller
said, "A broadly based commodity price index may be worth
exploring" as a guide to monetary policy.
    "In times of rising commodity prices, monetary policy might
be tightened and in times of falling commodity prices, monetary
policy might be eased," he said.
    Commodities are also standardized to avoid measurement
problems and occur at the beginning of production so as to give
"early warning" signs of wholesale and retail changes.
    "There is no need to react to every small fluctuation in
commodity prices or to do so on a daily basis," Heller said in a
prepared text.
    "But if commodity prices exhibit a broad trend, a policy
action might be considered," he said.
    Heller said using a broad-based commodity price index as an
indicator for monetary policy would also contribute to
stabilized currency exchange rates.
    Commodity prices are generally uniform worldwide and prices
for them are more consistent than for other types of goods, he
said.
    He said other beneficial effects would be to stabilize
export commodity prices for developing countries by using a
commodity basket as a guidepost for monetary policy.

it had recorded its best general insurance result for six years
but had not reached satisfactory levels of profit in other
areas.
    Group Chief Executive Brian Corby told a news conference
that despite returning to trading profits, the International
division and the Mercantile and General division had not
reached satisfactory levels.
    But he said he welcomed Mercantile and General trading
profits in 1986 and was optimistic about both that and the
International division.
    The acquisition of the U.S. Life company <Jackson National>
had a small effect in 1986 but its full effect would be felt in
the 1987 results, Corby said.
    The Group also intended to expand the number of its estate
agency firms bought last year, and hoped they will comprise
between 10 and 15 pct of total company profits in the future.
    "We hope they will be very profitable very shortly. We are
looking for profits from the estate agencies themselves as well
as the insurance products associated with them," Corby said.
    Prudential's pre-tax profits rose from 1985's 110.1 mln stg
to 178.1 mln stg in 1986.

CRS Sirrine Inc said it plans a major
restructuring of its balance sheet that will include a
write-off of between 39 mln and 43 mln dlrs, most of which
would be intangible goodwill from the company's past
acquisitions.
    The company said the remainder of its write-off would
include a one-time expense for future costs related to early
retirement programs, office consolidations and an increase in
the general reserve for adjustments and contingencies.
    Bruce Wilkinson, president of the company, said the charges
to the company's third quarter earnings, for the period ending
March 31, would "significantly impact" third quarter results
but would not affect the company's cash position.
    "We expect to have the biggest operating backlog in the
company's history by June 30, 1987, the end of our fiscal
year," Wilkinson said. "We believe the action being proposed
will begin to contribute to improved earnings in the fourth
quarter of our fiscal 1987 and throughout fiscal 1988."
    The company, which is one of the nation's largest
construction firms, also said termination of its defined
benefit retirement plan would produce a pre-tax benefit of
about 10 mln dlrs due to overfunding of the plan.
    In its second quarter ended Dec. 31, CRSS had net earnings
of 800,000 dlrs on revenues of 82.5 mln dlrs.

Tonight's American Petroleum Institute
oil inventory report is expected to show another drawdown in
distillate stocks of between two and 7.5 mln barrels for the
week ending March 20, oil analysts and traders said.
    They said they expect gasoline inventories to be depleted
by about one to four mln barrels.
    Analysts were divided on the crude stocks. Some saw stocks
unchanged to as much as three mln barrels higher. Others said
stocks could be down one to five mln barrels. Crude throughput
volumes are expected to be unchanged to slightly higher or
lower than the week ended March 13, traders said.
    The API recorded a 7.4 mln barrel stockdraw for U.S.
distillates in the week ended March 13. Analysts see another 
draw reflecting historic seasonal trends.
    For the week ended March 13, API reported gasoline stocks
down 2.9 mln barrels.
    Those expecting a draw of as much as four mln barrels said
they are looking for fairly high consumption rates as the
spring and summer driving season gets underway this year,
because retail prices are still low compared to recent years.
    U.S. crude oil stocks were reported down by 4.4 mln barrels
for the week ended March 13. Analysts are divided over the
outcome for last week because there is uncertainty about
whether throughput levels increased or decreased last week.
    Some see crude stock levels unchanged to three mln barrels
higher, while others think inventories could be as much as five
mln barrels below the previous week.
    The lower estimates are supported by the belief that crude
runs increased and imports fell.
    The API reported crude runs 154,000 b/d higher for the week
ended March 13. Analysts are calling it unchanged to slightly
up or down for the week ended March 20.
    Expectations for product stockdraws are already being
reflected in firmer prices, traders said. But if draws are at
the higher end of the estimated range, they added, the effect
will be bullish. Any stockbuild would be a negative factor,
they said.
    Crude runs normally increase in March, and any decrease in
runs would be friendly to the market, said Peter Beutel of
Elders Energy Futures Inc.

The move by foreign exchange markets to
test the strength of the Paris currency accord has thrown into
question the near-term outlook for sterling, until recently one
of the main beneficiaries of the agreement, analysts said.
    Since the six-nation accord last month, sterling has risen
sharply, adding almost five pct on its trade-weighted index.
    While the accord effectively stifled dollar/yen and
dollar/mark movements, the markets turned their attention to
sterling as foreign investors rushed to take advantage of
relatively high U.K. Interest rates.
    But analysts say the pound has been sidelined by the first
tentative test of the Paris accord seen yesterday.
    The market now looks set sooner or later to push the dollar
down further in a test of the willingness of central banks to
intervene. Analysts say if the banks do not intervene
effectively, the Paris accord could collapse.
    "On balance, sterling would be a net sufferer if G-6
collapses," Phillips and Drew analyst Stephen Lewis said.
    He said sterling would lose out as markets turned their
attention to capital movements whereas previously they had been
restricted to looking only at the interest yield on currencies.
    However, although most analysts and foreign exchange
dealers were forecasting a brief period of consolidation or
even retracement for sterling, none were expecting a very sharp
drop in the U.K. Currency.
    Sterling remained supported by optimism on the U.K.
Political and economic outlook, firmer oil prices and
relatively high interest rates, they said.
    Bullish sentiment on the U.K. Economic outlook has been
running especially high after last week's budget, seen as
popular both with the markets and with British voters.
    Sterling was also supported by signs of a weakening in the
West German and Japanese economies, where growth for 1987 is
trailing behind the three pct forecast for the U.K.
    Recent opinion polls showing Britain's ruling conservative
party ahead of opposition parties in popularity have also
supported the pound.
    In addition, sterling has so far shrugged off two
half-point cuts in U.K. Bank base lending rates in less than
two weeks. A further half-point cut, widely expected in the
next week or so, has already been largely discounted.
    U.K. Base rates, now running at 10 pct, are still
relatively high compared to other western countries, and
analysts said a further base rate cut to 9-1/2 pct was unlikely
to affect sterling.
    Sterling today appeared resilient to the dollar's decline,
dropping only slightly on a cross-rate basis.
    Worries about renewed turbulence in the foreign exchange
markets, however, were reflected in the U.K. Government bond
(gilt) market, where prices dropped by up to 5/16 point.
    Until now foreign investor interest in the gilt market has
been one of the major reasons behind the rise in sterling.
    Dealers said they expected the pound to hold quietly steady
for the next few days while the market awaits further
developments on the dollar and this Thursday's U.K. Current
account figures for February.
    Market forecasts are for a deficit of around 250 mln stg
after January's small surplus.

The president of the Export-Import
Bank said the Bank was changing its lending policies to reflect
changing conditions in export financing.
    President John Bohn told a House Appropriations
subcommittee hearing commercial banks have largely withdrawn
from financing exports and export projects were becoming
smaller.
    "Exporters now need financing in riskier markets and on
deals which are smaller, take longer to put together and
close," Bohn said in his testimony. "Lenders, however, want
less risk, higher profit, transaction-oriented and less
labor-intensive activities.
    "It became clear to us the EXimbank must assume a broader
range of explicitly defined country and transaction risks than
it has previously. Programs and procedures need to be
simplified, streamlined and internally consistent," he said.
    Bohn said the Bank would focus on the needs of the middle
market product or service exporter and would have essentially
one loan program and one guarantee program for both medium-term
and long-term export transactions.
    "Both programs will provide up to 85 pct financing, the
maximum permitted under the OECD consensus. Eximbank loans will
carry the minimum interest rate allowed by the OECD rate
schedule for the market and the term," he said.
    Bohn said the Bank was requesting a limitation of 1 billion
dlrs for regular loan obligations, of which up to 200 mln dlrs
may be available as tied aid credits, and a limitation of 10
billion dlrs for guarantee and insurance commitments.
    He said the Bank would have to come back to Congress later
this year to discuss its capitalization needs.

American Telephone and Telegraph Co
said it formed a 600-member sales force dedicated exclusively
to its computers and other data systems products.
    Separately, ATT denied reports that it plans to buy back a
large chunk of its stock. ATT's stock was up 1/4 points at
25-1/8 in heavy trading.
    The company said it also created a separate 600-member team
that will educate the computer sales force and its other sales
groups on ATT's computer products. This group, ATT said,
reports directly to Vittorio Cassoni, senior vice president of
its computer unit, called the Data Systems division.
    Cassoni, speaking at a news conference at which ATT
unveiled its most powerful mid-range computer, said the sales
groups will provide a "sharper focus" to ATT's computer
marketing efforts.
    The executive, hired from Olivetti to bolster ATT's
unsuccessful campaign to become a major vendor of computer
gear, also said the company is committed to its 3B line of
mid-range computers. He said ATT backed the 3B line despite
widespread criticism throughout the industry that it is
inferior to mid-range systems made by International Business
Machines Corp <IBM>, Digital Equipment Corp <DEC> and others.
    Cassoni, however, said ATT would strenghten the 3B line
within the next three or four months. He said ATT will offer
new, more powerful mid-range computers that will protect the
investments of existing 3B users in ATT hardware and software.
    In justifying the company's commitment to the 3B line,
which was originally developed for internal use by ATT and its
former Bell telephone company units, Cassoni pointed to several
recent sales that he said proved the mid-range line's
commercial viability.
    One example he provided was a recent 34 mln dlr deal ATT
signed with the United States Postal Service.
    Cassoni also said ATT will announce a new personal computer
based on the powerful 80386 microprocessor from Intel Corp
<INTC>.
   Compaq Computer Corp <CPQ> is already selling a 386-based PC
and IBM is widely expected to announce a 386 machine sometime
this year.
   Cassoni said the Data Systems division is unprofitable and
that it will take "a couple of years" for the division to meet
its goal of making a "substantial contribution to ATT's
earnings stream." But, he added, the division is "approaching"
the point where it can start making money.
    Cassoni said the new products introduced today are "a very
significant step to foster our efforts in the computer
business."
    Among the new offerings is the 3B2/600 minicomputer, which
ATT said can provide up to four times the processing power of
the 3B2/400, previously its biggest computer.
    But with a top speed of 4.0 mips, or million instructions
per second, the top-of-line 3B cannot match the computing power
of rival systems from IBM and DEC.

Standard Chartered Plc <STCH.L>, faced
with a recession in the key Singapore and Malaysian markets and
an ongoing depression in the shipping industry, boosted its
bad-debt provisions in 1986, chairman Lord Barber said.
    Barber said in a statement on the bank's 1986 results that
bad and doubtful debt provisions, both general and specific,
stood at 545.6 mln stg against 416.6 mln at end-1985.
    Bank figures showed the increase was almost exclusively in
the specific bad risk provision, which qualifies for U.K. Tax
breaks. New specific provisions rose by 111.5 mln stg while
71.2 mln stg were reallocated from the general risk provision.
    In all, a 184.2 mln stg charge was made against profits for
1986, compared with a 100.7 mln stg charge in 1985. Total
pre-tax profits fell to 254 mln after 268 mln in 1985.
    "The continuing serious recessionary conditions in Singapore
and Malaysia and the depressed condition of the shipping
industry made it necessary to provide heavily against bad and
doubtful debs arising from loans in the Asia Pacific region, on
top of the normal level of provisioning," Barber said.
    He said, "the decision was also taken to build up loan loss
reeserves by making a sizeable increase in the charges for
general provisions for commercial and cross border risks."
    Barber said due to bad-debt provisioning, the Asia Pacific
region made "a negligible contribution to pre-tax profits."
    He said the profits contribution from the U.K. Businesses
was "well maintained, although the reported result was affected
by cross border debt provisioning," while Californian subsidiary
Union Bank "showed continued growth."
    "Tropical Africa, Middle East and South Asia all turned in
excellent performances and the revival in Europe continued," he
said.
    Barber said the group, which succesfully fought off a
takeover bid by Lloyds Bank <LLOY.L> last year, strengthened
its capital resources during that year to just over three
billion stg, while total assets increased to 32.2 billion.
    Capital adequacy ratios remained strong, with the primary
capital ratio standing at 7.5 pct at end 1986, he said.

Fairchild Industries Inc said it
will ask stockholders at its April 22 annual meeting to approve
its reincorporation in Delaware to allow more flexibility to
revise its capital structure, among other things. Fairchild is
now a Maryland corporation.
    Fairchild also cited Delaware's recently enacted statutory
provisions relating to directors' liability, allowing companies
to place limits on liability and expand their ablility to
protect corporate officers.
    William E. Fulwider, company spokesman, said Fairchild has
no specific plans to alter its capital structure.
    Fairchild said that if stockholders approve the
reincorporation, it would merge into a Delaware corporation and
its common and preferred would be automatically converted to 
the new corporation's shares, without any exchange of stock,
along with other assets and liabilities.
    Fairchild also said the new corporation would retain its
fair price charter provision.
    Earlier this month, Fairchild announced that it reached an
agreement with the Air Force to stop production on the T-46A
trainer jet.
    As a result, Fairchild said, it will close its Farmingdale,
N.Y., plant this year and layoff most of the plant's 2,800
employees, about a quarter of its entire workforce.
    Fairchild reported a 73.6 mln dlr fourth quarter loss
mainly due to charges for the plant closing and ending of the
trainer jet program. For the year, it reported a 10 mln dlr
loss, compared with a loss of 167.1 mln dlrs in 1985.

A top official of a major
association of blood banks said Americans' fears of getting 
AIDS from tainted blood transfusions were greatly exaggerated.
    "The (blood banking) system is strong," Edwin Steane,
president of the American Association of Blood Banks, said at a
news briefing here. "The current fears about AIDS transmission
are largely unfounded."
    Steane made his remarks after the group found in a public
opinion poll that 55 pct of Americans believed it likely that
one could contract AIDS from a tainted blood transfusion.
    The poll, conducted in December, was made public today.
    A year earlier, in a similar survey, 53 pct of Americans
said it was likely that one could contract AIDS from a blood
transfusion, the group reported.
    Steane said the practice of testing donated blood for the
presence of AIDS antibodies, begun in mid-1985, had virtually
eliminated AIDS-infected blood from the U.S. supply system.
    He said the federal Centers for Disease Control (CDC) had
reported only two cases of tainted blood being transfused since
the testing program began.

France's economic recovery will take
several years, Finance Minister Edouard Balladur told the
Economic and Social Council (CES), an advisory body composed of
industrialists, trade unionists and representatives of other
sectors of the French economy.
    "We will bear for long years to come the weight of the
choices made at the start of the oil crisis about 15 years ago,
unfavorable choices for industries but favorable for
households," he said without elaborating.
    "It is the cost of this choice that our industries are still
having to bear. We must improve their competitivity to regain
growth and employment," Balladur added.
    Balladur said the French budget deficit must be reduced to
below 70 billion francs from 129 billion forecast for 1987 but
he gave no time-scale. He has already announced his intention
of cutting the deficit to 100 billion francs in 1989.
    He said France's public debt, expected to grow by 10 pct
this year compared with 1,300 billion francs in 1986, must not
increase by more than between 60 to 70 billion francs a year.
    He reaffirmed that income from the government's sweeping
privatization program, seen to be at least 30 billion francs
for 1987, must be used mainly to pay off French state debt and
not to finance current needs.

Cyacq Corp, an investor group bidding
for Cyclops Corp, said it amended its outstanding 92.50 dlrs a
share tender offer for Cyclops to eliminate two conditions and
modify a third one.
    The group, which includes Audio/Video Affiliates Inc and a
unit of Citicorp <CCI>, said it also obtained additional
financing commitments, including an increased commitment from
Citicorp Capital Investors Ltd.
    The conditions that were eliminated are Cyacq's request for
non-public information about Cyclops that was previously
provided to Dixons Group PLC and Cyacq's being satisified that
the information provides an adequate basis for Cyclop's
published financial projections.
    Cyclops has agreed to be acquired Dixons Group, which has a
90.25 dlrs a share tender offer for Cyclops outstanding. Dixons
said earlier it would allow the offer to expire tonight.
    The condition that was modified, which required Cyacq to be
satisfied that break up fees or other obligations to Dixons
were rescinded or ineffective, now says Cyclops shall not have
paid any such fees or expenses to Dixons prior to the
consummation of Cyacq's offer.
    Cyacq's amended offer expires midnight New York time on
April three, 1987, unless extended.
    Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co and CIT Group/Business
Credit Inc increased its tender offer commitment to 197 mln
dlrs from 166 mln dlrs and its merger commitment to 275 mln
dlrs from 250 mln dlrs.
    Additionally, the Citicorp unit and Audio/Video have
increased their commitments to Cyacq to 185 mln dlrs. Of the
new total, 150 mln dlrs has been committed by Citicorp.
    Cyacq said it estimates that it needs 407.5 mln dlrs to buy
all Cyclops shares that may be tendered and pay related fees
and expenses.
    It said it is seeking to arrange the balance of about 25.5
mln dlrs necessary to complete the offer.
    All previously announced conditions regarding the lending
group led by Manufacturers Hanover remain in effect, except
that the loans are subject to the concurrent receipt by Cyacq
of equity contributions and other financing of not less than
210.5 mln dlrs for the tender offer facility and 213.5 mln dlrs
for the merger facility.
    Cyacq also said the Citicorp unit had received no
indications of interest in an alternative offer it had made
from Dixons, Cyclops or Alleghany Corp <Y>, which has agreed to
acquire Cyclops' industrial group from Dixons.
    Under the alternative offer, the Citicorp unit, with
Cyacq's approval, proposed to acquire the industrial group from
Dixons.

session on April 8-9 when decisions are needed on the budget

ITC presence to answer the still unresolved legal disputes over
the outstanding debts of its buffer stock with court hearings
likely to continue well after the June 30 expiry of the pact.
    The ITC was informally told of the appeal made yesterday by

ruling against it in the legal bid it led on behalf of ITC
creditor brokers to have the ITC wound up.
    In January the judge ruled that the U.K. Court had no
jurisdiction to wind up the tin council, the ITC was not an
association within the meaning of the U.K. Companies act, and
the winding-up petition was not a proceeding in respect in
respect of an arbitration award.
    AMT is appealing on all points and has said it is important
for the court to accept that a winding-up petition is a move to
enforce an arbitration ruling.

Eastman Kodak Co said it will
reduce capacity and employment levels in two polyester fiber
operations of its Eastman Chemicals division.
    A company spokesman said the company will take "some
writeoff" in connection with the action in the first quarter
and there will probably be a further "carryover" writeoff in
the second quarter.  The writeoffs will cover the costs of
plants and equipment involved, as well as expenses connected
with the staff cuts.
    Kodak said the division will discontinue production of
polyester partially-oriented filament yarn, or POY, at its
Carolina Eastman Co plant in Columbia, S.C., and will idle 100
mln pounds of older polyester staple fiber production capacity,
mostly in Columbia.
    The company said about 350 jobs will be affected in
Columbia, most of which are now performed by contract workers,
and about 225 jobs at its Tennessee Eastman Co plant in
Kingsport, Tenn.
    Kodak said part of the staff reduction will be achieved
through an enhanced voluntary separation and retirement plan
for employees of Carolina Eastman, Eastman Chemical Products
Inc and other Kodak units in Kingsport, except Holsten Defense
Corp. Most of the workforce reduction is expected to be
completed by April 30.
    Kodak said depressed prices and poor financial performance
have led to the decision. It said about 50 mln pounds of POY
production will be shut down as a result of its exit from the
business. All Kodak POY production has been at Carolina Eastman
since last year.
    The company said annual capacity for production of Kodel
polyester staple fiber will be reduced to 400 mln pounds from
500 mln due to lesser demand.
    It said it will proceed with a previous decision to phase
in a new 100 mln pound staple fiber plant at Carolina Eastman.
    Carolina Eastman employs about 1,350 and the Kingsport
units affected about 10,800.
    The company spokesman later said the charges will be
insignificant and will have no impact on earnings estimates.

Heavy buying by speculators boosted
Conrac Corp 7-7/8 to 29, higher than a 25-dlr-per-share cash
tender offer announced by Mark IV Industries Inc <IV>.
    "It's a case of ChemLawn euphoria," said one arbitrageur,
referring to a recent hostile tender that began at 27 dlrs per
share and ended when ChemLawn Corp <CHEM> found a white knight
willing to bid 36.50 dlrs.
    For Conrac, the arbitrageur said, 28 dlrs per share seemed
like an "appropriate price." Another said "it's too early to
project the outcome."
    "The market is speaking for itself and saying the 25 dlr
offer is inadequate," the second arbitrageur said. But he added
it was hard to make a case for Conrac being worth much more
than the 29 dlrs where the shares traded today.
    He noted the stock recently sold in the high teens and
there could be a downward risk of 10 dlrs or more if Conrac is
able to thwart Mark IV.
    Conrac urged shareholders to take no action while its board
studies the offer and confers with advisers. Conrac said it
would make a recommendation by April 17.
    A third arbitrageur noted Mark IV had been involved in
several takeovers previously and has proven itself to be a
determined bidder. "They're not beginners," he said.
    Another said Conrac might have trouble if it tried to find
another buyer. "It's a hodge-podge of non-related businesses,"
he said. "There is only a small universe of people who would
want to own the company as it's presently structured."
    Conrac is involved in video displays, computer software,

    "I'm telling retail clients to sell and leave the rest for
those who can take the risk," said Rudolph Hokanson, analyst at

    He called the 25-dlr offer by Mark IV "fair value but on

    Hokanson said Conrac has conservative finances and has

President Reagan signed a bill
limiting fees that may be charged by the Government National
Mortgage Association (GNMA) for its guarantees of privately
issued mortgage-backed securities but voiced serious
reservations about the measure.
    He said the bill's provision barring GNMA from increasing
its current fee of .06 pct charged to issuers of single-family
mortgage backed securities "is an unnecessary and risky
congressional intrusion into GNMA's ability to respond quickly
and flexibly to changes in financial markets."
    Reagan said his reservations "must be addressed promptly
through remedial amendments."
    Reagan said the provision hampered GNMA's ability to
maintain reserves necessary to meet its obligations,
"particularly in light of a disturbing increase in claims and in
GNMA's contingent liabilities."
    Reagan said the legislative cap on fees "could well call
into question the adequacy of GNMA's  current reserve of 1.4
billion dlrs, given the 250 billion in GNMA-guaranteed
securities presently outstanding and GNMA's monthly contingent
liability of three billion dlrs."
    Reagan said he had instructed Housing Secretary Samuel

legislation.

rate of refinery production should increase product prices and

Wainoco Oil Corp said it is undergoing
a recapitalization program with a proposed offering of two mln
units consisting of common shares and warrants, the planned
redemption of its shareholder value rights, and a change in its
corporate structure that substantially reduces futurer income
taxes.
    Wainoco said it had filed a registration statement with the
Securities and Exchange Commission for the offering of the two
mln units consisting of two shares of common stock and one
warrrant per unit for a total of four mln shares of common
stock and two mln warrants.
    Included in the two mln units to be offered are 280,000
shares of common stock to be sold by <Waverly Oil Co>,
 a selling shareholder of Wainoco, it said.
    Proceeds of the offering will be used to reduce bank debt,
the company said. It said its outstanding 10-3/4 pct
subordinated debentures may be used at face value to pay the
exercise price of the warrants.
    Wainoco said the offering will be underwritten by  E.F.
Hutton and Co Inc, Kidder Peabody and Co Inc, and Smith Barney
harris Upham Inc.
    Simultaneous with the offering, Wainoco said it intends to
redeem its shareholder value rights attached to each common
share at 10 cts per right. Wainoco said without redemption of
the value rights, the company would not have sufficient
authorized and unissued shares of common stock to complete the
units offering.
    Due to certain covenants under the company's 10-3/4 pct
subordinated debentures, the value rights redemption is
contingent upon the success of the units offering, it said.
    Wainoco's said its shareholders purchase rights distributed
to the shareholders in June 1986 are unaffected and remain
valid.
    It said as a result of the liquidation of its Canadian
subsidiary into the parent company, it will be able to offset
all of its corporate overhead expenses and some of its
debenture interests against Canadian income for tax purposes.
    Wainoco said its pool of future Canadian tax deductions has
been increased by an amount which should generate savings that
will exceed existing deferred income tax liability.
    Existing U.S. tax loss carryforward benefits in the U.S.
are not materially affected, the company said. It added this
will considerably reduce future income taxes in Canada and add
to Wainoco's net income and cash flow for a number of years.
    John Ashmun, chairman of Wainoco, said "as a result of this
recapitalization, Wainoco will be in a strong financial
position.
    "Our net income and cash flow will benefit from lower
interest expense, lower Canadian taxes, and the considerable
savings achieved over the past few years from cost reductions,"
he said.
    Ashmun said the company will be able to "utilize enhanced
cash flow to develop its large resource base and explore for
additional reserves at a time when exploration and development
costs are low and opportunities abound rather than using a
disproportiaonate share of cash flow for debt service."

The International Cocoa Organization
(ICCO) moved closer to an agreement on buffer stock rules, with
many delegates saying they expect to reach an accord by Friday.
    "Everyone is convinced the buffer stock rules should be in
place by Friday so the buffer stock can be put into operation
Monday," a consumer delegate said. "The atmosphere is excellent."
    Other delegates said the buffer stock might not be
operational by Monday but could be in place by around April 1,
if the rules are agreed by Friday.
    A detailed package on how the buffer stock manager will buy
and sell cocoa was presented to a buffer stock working group
this afternoon -- a big step toward a "very interesting stage of
negotiations," delegates said.
    The package, based on negotiating principles informally
agreed by delegates, has been forged bit by bit during
fortnight-long meetings by ICCO Executive Director Kobena
Erbynn and a small group of other delegates.
    Producers, the European Community (EC) and consumers are
scheduled to consider the paper separately and then jointly
tomorrow.
    Under the proposal, the buffer stock manager would buy
cocoa from origins or the second-hand market on an offer
system. He would alert the market via news agencies as to when
he wanted to buy cocoa and include shipment details and tonnage
desired, delegates said.
    The manager would buy cocoa on a competitive basis, rather
than choosing the cheapest cocoa as before, giving preference
to ICCO member-country exporters. Standard price differentials
would be fixed for each origin, similar to golf handicaps, to
determine the relative competitiveness of offers of various
cocoas from different origins, they said.
    The differentials could be reviewed at the request of a
member country or recommendation of the buffer stock manager,
the delegates said. Revision would be decided by a majority
vote of the ICCO council.
    Buffer stock purchases from non-ICCO member countries would
not be allowed to exceed 10 pct of the total buffer stock, they
said.
    The purchases would be limited to 5,000 tonnes of cocoa per
day and 20,000 tonnes per week, and could be bought in nearby,
intermediate and forward positions, they added.
    One of the underlying ideas of the rules package is
"transparency," meaning virtually all the buffer stock manager's
market activities will be public and he will have as little
discretion as possible, delegates said.
    After the tin market collapse in 1985, when the
International Tin Council buffer stock ran out of funds, cocoa
delegates are anxious to install safeguards in the cocoa market
mechanism, they said.
     Earnest debate on the buffer stock proposal is expected to
begin late tomorrow, as delegations feel the pressure of the
approaching Friday deadline, when the ICCO meeting is due to
adjourn, delegates said.
    The ICCO failed to agree buffer stock rules in January when
the new International Cocoa Agreement came into force. The
existing buffer stock of 100,000 tonnes of cocoa was frozen in
place with its bank balance of 250 mln dlrs -- both untouchable
until rules are agreed.
     Though the current semi-annual council meeting is not the
last chance for delegates to cement buffer stock rules,
producers are keen to get the wheels of the market-stabilizing
mechanism turning to stem the decline in world prices,
delegates said.

Imperial Oil Ltd, 70 pct owned by Exxon
Corp <XON>, will focus on maintaining its financial strength
and improving near-term earnings performance through operating
expense reductions and selective capital spending, the company
said in the annual report.
    Imperial Oil said it expects to spend about 750 mln dlrs on
capital and exploration expenditures in 1987, compared to 648
mln dlrs in 1986 and 1.16 billion dlrs in 1985.
    Imperial previously reported 1986 operating net profit fell
to 440 mln dlrs or 2.69 dlrs share from 694 mln dlrs or 4.27
dlrs share in the prior year.
    Imperial Oil said the attention to earnings results from
the desire to pursue longer term growth opportunities should
the investment climate improve and the belief that low or
volatile crude oil prices could continue during the next
several years.
    The company also said actions initiated during 1986 to
restructure and improve efficiency should continue to show
benefits in 1987.
    During 1986, the company cut operating, administrative and
marketing expenses by 91 mln dlrs and reduced the number of
workers by 16 pct to 12,500.
    Imperial chairman Arden Haynes said in the annual report
that it is too early to determine whether the recent upward
movement in international oil prices will be sustained.
    "It is still a time for prudence and caution, and the
company's actions will continue to be based on the fundamentals
of market supply and demand," he said.
    Haynes said prospects for the company's petroleum products
division are more promising than before, but are still
uncertain. Imperial's 1986 petroleum earnings rose to 174 mln
dlrs from 102 mln dlrs in 1985.
    Haynes said more satisfactory product margins on its
petroleum products could result if demand recovers as it has in
the United States.
    The company's chemicals business outlook is mixed, Haynes
said. Prospects for growth in petrochemical sales is good as
long as economic growth continues, but future large grain
surpluses could dampen fertilizer demand and maintain pressure
on prices.
    Imperial's chemical business earned 17 mln dlrs in 1986,
compared to three mln dlrs in 1985.

CPC International Inc said it reached
an agreement in principle to sell its European corn wet milling
business to Agricola Finanziaria SpA, a member of the Ferruzzi
Group, for a price in excess of 600 mln dlrs.
    The transaction is expected to be completed by September
30.
    CPC said it expects no material gain or loss this year from
the transaction. But the effect of the deal on 1987 earnings
can be evaluated in full only when the definitive pacts are
completed, it said.
    The long-term effect of the transaction on CPC's earnings
should be positive, it added, as it will allow capital
expenditures to be cut back and will reduce corporate and
divisional overheads as well as operating expenses in the
European business.
    The sale is an important part of a restructuring announced
in November, CPC said.
    Proceeds of the sale will be used to reduce debt incurred
in the purchase of the Arnold Foods and Old London specialty
baking businesses and the stock repurchase program that was 
part of the restructuring.
    As of December 31, CPC had bought about 15 mln of its
common shares, adjusted for a 2-for-1 split in January, for a
total cost of 621.8 mln dlrs, according to its 1986 annual
report.
    In December, CPC acquired Arnold Foods and Old London for a
total of about 170 mln dlrs.
    CPC had previously said it wanted to sell the European corn
wet milling business and use the proceeds to help reduce debt,
including that incurred under the share buyback.
    In total, CPC has bought back about 16 mln shares of common
stock, adjusted for the split, it said today. In November it
authorized a buyback of 20 mln shares, adjusted for the split.
    The buyback and the restructuring were triggered in
November, after companies controlled by Ronald Perelman,
chairman of Revlon Group Inc <REV>, acquired about 7.6 pct of
CPC's then outstanding stock.
    In 1986, the European corn wet milling business had sales
of 914.1 mln dlrs, operating income before overheads of 68.8
mln dlrs and associated headquarters overhead costs of 19.7 mln
dlrs, according to CPC's 1986 annual report.

American Express Co's <AXP> recent
launch of a new "OPTIMA" credit card, with relatively low
interest rates and fees, will increase competition with bank
credit-card issuers but will not lead to a pricing war, a
senior Citicorp offical said.
    "Over the next two to three years, a very interesting
marketing battle will be fought ... competition will not be on
price but on product features," Pei-yuan Chia, head of the U.S.
card products group, told a banking analysts meeting.
    Citicorp is the leading U.S. bank credit-card issuer, with
some 10 mln accounts and an 11 pct market share.
    Chia said that Citicorp would focus its credit card
marketing efforts on acceptance, noting that Visa and
Mastercard currently enjoy a two-to-one advantage over American
Express in terms of worldwide acceptance.
    He also doubted the popularity of American Express' plan to
link interest charges on the new OPTIMA card to the bank prime
lending rate. "The consumer likes to have a fixed rate
instrument," he said.
    Richard Braddock, head of the whole individual banking
division, added that when there is increased competition, "it
is not the big people who get crunched but the small ones."

by Democratic committee chairman William Gray as a make-up
meeting to end bickering that has delayed budget activity  for

    He said the Republicans were prepared to make a "good faith"
effort to cooperate if the budget deliberations were held

    However, they failed to appear today and Gray said he had
been told they wanted House Speaker Jim Wright to answer a

A member of the board which
regulates the farm credit system said Congress should plan to
provide at least 800 mln dlrs in fiscal 1988 to bailout the
troubled system, but other members of the board differed.
    Jim Billington, Farm Credit Administration (FCA) board
member told a House Agriculture Appropriations subcommittee
hearing "I feel your subcommittee should plan on providing at
least 800 mln next year to assist the Farm Credit System."
    However, FCA board member Marvin Duncan differed, saying
"it is premature to talk about the cost of a solution until we
know what kind of solution."
    Chairman of the FCA board, Frank Naylor, said it might be
possible to structure a rescue of the system with government
guarantees or a line of credit which requires little or no
upfront government money.
    However, Billington said Congress must provide help
immediately because "this system needs some assurance that it
will get some help."
    The FCA estimates the system could lose up to 1.4 billion
dlrs in 1987, exhausting the remainder of its working capital,
Naylor said.
    The farm credit system is expected to present its own
proposals for government aid to a Senate Agriculture
subcommittee hearing on Thursday.
    Naylor said the Treasury Department is continuing to refine
Reagan administration ideas on how a rescue should be
structured.
    Congressional sources said they hope to begin drafting a

Sales of U.S.-made cars during
mid-March, the traditional start of the spring selling season,
dropped 3.9 pct behind last year's level, analysts say.
    Automakers sold about 204,000 cars in the March 11-20
selling period, 10,000 fewer than last year. Analysts said the
decline may auger poorly for the rest of the spring season.
    Buyers shied away from the showrooms of American Motors
Corp <AMO>, the target of a 1.5 billion dlr takeover bid from
Chrysler Corp <C>. Analysts said consumers were anxious about
the whether Chrysler will retain some American Motors models,
causing a 62 pct drop in American Motors sales in mid-March.
    Chrysler's mid-March sales fell 3.6 pct.
    "During the spring selling season, you usually look for
some kind of seasonal uplift in sales. It doesn't look like
it's happening," said Joseph Philippi, analyst with E.F. Hutton
and Co.
    "There may be less bloom to the spring selling season this
year than last," one auto company official conceded.
    General Motors Corp <GM>, still working to regain consumer
interest in its cars, led the drop with a 14.8 pct decline.
    Ford Motor Co's <F> sales increased 15.2 pct for the
period. But analysts said the rise compares to a 1986 period
for Ford, leaving it down 10 pct in two years.
    "The total industry (mid-March sales) was slightly less
than expected," the company official said.
    American Motors' decline caught analysts eye. "American
Motors took it on the chin--big," said Philippi.
    Given the prospective takeover by Chrysler, "people might
be a little leary about going to (American Motors) dealers," he
said.
    American Motors sold 790 domestic cars in the period,
meaning each of American Motors 1,050 dealers "is selling a car
about every other day," Philippi said.
    Potential American Motors buyers are afraid their car
models "might disappear," he said.
    Chrysler, in its purchase agreement with American Motors'
majority stockholder <Renault>, has agreed not to undercut
sales of American Motors' new Medallion and Premier cars, made
by Renault.
    On a company by company basis, sales of U.S. made cars from
the March 11 to 20 period were--GM 105,438, down 14.8 pct, Ford
67,672, up 15.2 pct, Chrysler 30,909, down 3.6 pct, American
Motors 790, down 6.2 pct, American Honda 7,447 compared with
5,031, Nissan Motor Corp, 3,358, up 10.7 pct, Volkswagon U.S.
Inc 1,330, down 35 pct.

Resorts International Inc
said it received a proposal from <KSZ Co Inc> under which
holders of Resorts class B stock would receive 140 dlrs a share
in cash and one share of common stock in a new company to be
formed through the takeover.
    Under the offer, Resorts said holders of its class A shares
would receive 15 dlrs a share in cash and three shares of
common stock in the new company.
    Resorts said the offer from KSZ calls for a merger of
Resorts with RI Acquisition Co Inc, a newly formed Delaware
corporation.
    Resorts said that prior to the merger, RI Acquisition would
be capitalized with about 100 mln dlrs of debt and about 220
mln dlrs of equity.
    It said 200 mln dlrs of the equity would be in the form of
special preferred stock.
    The KSZ offer, Resorts said, indicates that KSZ has a
commitment from <M. Davies Cos> to buy all of the special
preferred stock.
    Resorts said the offer will expire at 1700 EST on March 27.
It said it asked its investment advisor, Bear, Stearns and Co,
to advise its board on the offer.
    Earlier this month, the estate of James M. Crosby and
certian members of his family agreed to sell their class B
shares to New York real estate tycoon Donald Trump for 135 dlrs
a share. The estate and family members hold 78 pct of the
752,297 class B shares outstanding.
    Trump also agreed to pay 135 dlrs a share for the remaining
class B shares outstanding.
    Resorts also has about 5,680,000 shares of outstanding
class A stock. These shares carry one one-hundredth the voting
power of the class B shares.
    Trump's offer beat out a rival bid of 135 dlrs a share made
by Pratt Hotel Corp <PRAT>.
    Resorts said that under the proposal made by KSZ, existing
class A and class B shareholders would control about 96 pct of
the outstanding common of the new company formed to acquire
Resorts.
    Resorts said the new company, upon completion of the
merger, would hold the 220 mln dlrs of debt and that the
special preferred stock would immediately be converted into
exchangeable participating preferred of the new company.
    This preferred, Resorts said, would pay a dividend based on
the net cash flows from the new company's Paradise Island
operations.
    A Resorts spokesman said the KSZ offer was made in a
two-page letter and that Resorts could not comment on it
because it did not contain enough information. Resorts has
asked Bear, Sterns to obtain complete data, he said.
    The spokesman said Resorts is not familiar with KSZ but
that it believes the company is controlled by Marvin Davis, the
Denver oilman.
    Calls to Davis were referred to Lee Solters, who handles
public relations for Davis. Solters, said to be travelling, was
not immediately available for comment.
    Donald Trump was also unavailable for comment, as was a
spokesman for the Crosby estate.

bankcard unit will taper off in coming years from 1986's
relatively inflated levels.
    - Customer net revenue in the mortgage banking area will
rise to 464.7 mln dlrs in 1987 from 374.3 mln in 1986.
    - The international consumer business will show 22 pct

U.S. corn acreage this year is 
likely to drop to the lowest level since the unsurpassed
acreage reductions of the 1983 PIK year and could rank as one
of the lowest corn plantings in the United States in sixty
years, Agriculture Department officials said.
    USDA releases its official plantings report on March 31.
Agriculture Department analysts said next week's figures will
likely show a sharp drop in acreage to as low as 65 mln acres,
down 22 pct from last year's plantings of 83.3 mln acres.
    Assuming an 18 mln acre drop in plantings, U.S. corn
production will also decrease significantly. Analysts said 1987
corn production could drop by over one billion bushels to
around seven billion bushels.
    Expected signup of up to 90 pct in the 1987 feed grains
program, along with 1.9 mln acres enrolled in the conservation
program, will cause acreage to plummet, Department feedgrain
analysts said.
    "There's no question that there will be a sharp decrease in
corn acreage," one said. "It's difficult for any farmer to not
go along with the program this year."
    Soybean acreage is also expected to decline this year but
at a much slower rate of around four pct, USDA analysts said.
    Soybean plantings could drop to 59 mln acres or below, they
said, compared to last year's level of 61.5 mln acres.
    If analysts' unofficial estimates prove correct then the
drop in u.s. corn acreage will be the largest since 1983 when
farmers idled 22 mln acres in the Payment-In-Kind program.
    Farmers planted only around 60 mln acres of corn in 1983. A
severe drought that summer in major producing states caused
yields to tumble and final crop production to total only 4.2
billion bushels.
    Given normal weather conditions this year, USDA analysts
said the 1987 corn crop could end up around seven billion
bushels, down from last year's crop of 8.3 billion bushels.
    "This kind of acreage reduction will mean a significant
reduction in production," an analyst said.
    A crop of seven billion bushels is close to the annual U.S.
corn usage, so surplus stocks, while not decreasing, would not
increase significantly, a specialist said.
    High producing corn belt states are expected to show the
greatest acreage reductions, based upon historical
participation in government programs, analysts said.
    In contrast, soybean acreage is likely to be cut the most
in marginal producing areas of the southeast and the western
corn belt, a USDA soybean analyst said.
    "Soybean acreage in the eastern corn belt will not budge,"
he said. Neither does he expect any significant acreage cuts in
higher-producing delta areas.
    Soybean production could drop fractionally from last year's
2.0 billion bushels to 1.8 to 1.9 billion, he said.
    U.S. soybean acreage, after soaring to 71.4 mln acres in
1979 from only 52 mln acres five years prior to that, has
steadily declined in the 1980's.
    U.S. corn acreage, with the exception of 1983, has been in
the low to mid 80-mln acre range for the past 10 years. The
highest corn plantings reported in the 60 years that USDA has
kept such records was in 1932 when farmers planted 113 mln
acres and obtained average yields of 26.5 bushels per acre.
    Last year U.S. farmers obtained record corn yields
averaging 119.3 bushels per acre.
    "We have absolutely no trouble producing an eight billion
bushel crop on only 80 mln acres or so," an analyst said.
    Corn acreage will probably level at around 65 mln acres as
long as government program provisions remain the same, analysts
said.
    Currently farmers enrolling in the program are required to
set aside 20 pct of their base acreage and then are eligible
for payments of two dlrs per bushel by idling an additional 15
pct of their acreage.
    "To get to the PIK level of 60 mln acres, we would have to
provide more incentives," an analyst said.

the union took the action following the firing of 17 flight
attendants who had been handing out information brochures at
American's terminals at the Dallas-Fort Worth airport.
    The union has been negotiating for a new contract with the
American Airlines for the past seven months. The union is
seeking abolishment by the airline of a two-tier wage system
for flight attendants.
    Gibbs said at a press conference today that American had
fired seven flight attendants "on the spot" last Sunday, and by
Monday a total of 17 had been fired.

Automobile dealerships have become
large, multi-store operations, and the largest sell more than 1
billion dlrs a year worth of vehicles a year.
    Around the auto industry there is talk of mergers and
buyouts among dealerships, and there are rumors that the
largest are considering offering shares to the public, analysts
say.
    Retail car sales "are at a point of transition. There's not
much that's off the table in terms of creative thinking" about
ways to sell cars, says David Cole, analyst with the University
of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute.
    The retail car market is "much more freeform now" than it
was in 1956, the year things began to change, says Detroit
analyst Arvid Jauppi of Arvid Jauppi and Associates.
    Thirty years ago, in 1956, the situation was different.
Dealerships sold one kind of car--a "Chevy" or a Ford or a
Studebaker. The average dealer had 17 employees and sold
738,000 dlrs worth of vehicles, according to the National
Automobile Dealers Association.
    That year a tiny car from overseas--Germany's Volkswagen
Beatle--began to gain popularity. The "Bug" caused "a
rebellion" among dealers, who demanded greater freedom from
restrictions placed on them by the major American automakers,
says Jauppi.
    One of the most visible changes in retail car sales has
been in the size of dealerships, auto analysts say. Last year,
the average dealership had 11.2 mln dlrs in sales--a 15-fold
increase from 1956--and employed 34 workers.
    "I had one of these guys tell me he makes six, seven mln
dlrs a year and didn't know what to do with all his money,"
says Cole.
    "There's a whole lot more rich guys who sell cars than that
make cars," he says.
    With the increase in size, large dealers have been buying
up other dealerships, and auto analysts see few signs the trend
will let up.
    Donald Keithley, vice president, dealer services, for J.D.
Power, a California-based market research firm, says that, by
1990, 12,000 people will own dealerships compared to 16,800
principal owners today.
    Many dealers are experimenting with owning several
franchises, some of which might compete against each other. "It
used to be a Chevrolet dealer was a Chevrolet dealer. Now a
Chevrolet dealer might handle several lines," Jauppi says.
    As dealers get bigger, industry officials are talking about
the possibility that some of them might become publicly-owned
or open international operations.
    Offering shares to the public is an option large dealers,
"are obviously thinking of very seriously," says Cole.
    Although some say the franchise system might get in the way
of a public offering, Jauppi says there are few obstacles to
trading in car dealer shares.
    "Dealers are large enough now to go public. The only thing
the manufacturer cares about is that the dealer sells those
cars. It could happen any time," Jauppi says.
    "If you look at the whole merger mania, and look at the
scale some of these dealers, it's going to be very hard to
resist taking them public," said another analyst.
    And Jauppi says that dealerships can be expected to become
international.
    "We're going to have international dealers--dealer networks
that are worldwide," he says. U.S. dealers will be attracted
particularly to Europe, where the market will expand faster
than the U.S., he says.
    "It's not totally off the wall," says Cole.

Chapman Energy INc said it is launching
a major restructuring which, if not approved, it will have no
alternative but to seek protection under Chapter 11.
    Under the plan, Chapman will exchange securities and cash
for all outstanding 12 pct senior subordinated debentures due
2000 and will sell a controlling interest to Troon Partners
Ltd.
   The agreement with Troon requires Troon to advance 6.5 mln
dlrs partially secured by a first mortgage lien on the
company's interest in its natural gas pipeline partnership and
Troon to tender 100,000 principal amount of debentures to
Chapman.
    Proceeds of the loan will be used for the cash portion of
the restructuring. Troon will acquire a majority stock interest
and control of the board.
    In addition, Chapman and Troon will establish a 10 mln dlrs
acquisition joint ventures, it said.
    The plan also contemplates establishing a restructured loan
providing for one master credit agreement having an aggregate
balance of 22.4 mln dlrs.
    The plan also contemplates the recapitalization of
preferred stock whereby each share will be converted into three
shares of common stock.
    Chapman also said it also plans to negotiate settelment and
discharge of a substantial portion of its accounts payable and
settlement of certain litigation.
    If approved by various creditors and shareholders, the
company expects the plan to be completed by May 29.
    Chapman also repoted a loss of 43.4 mln dlrs for the year,
including asset writedowns of 35.5 mln dlrs, compared to
December 31, compared to a net income of 177,243 in 1985.
    The 1986 loss resulted in shareholders' deficiency of 15
mln dlrs compared to shareholder's equity of 28.9 mln last
year.
    Total assets decreased to 35.6 mln dlrs from 81.8 mln dlrs.

the dollar up above 150 yen. But heavy selling at around that

Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita
said that current exchange rates are almost within the levels
agreed to by six major nations last month in Paris.
    Asked whether a dollar/yen rate of 148 or 149 reflected
economic fundamentals, he said current rates almost reflect
fundamentals.
    Sumita told reporters major nations have cooperated to
bring about currency stability in line with the Paris
agreement, which stipulated that they would closely cooperate
to that end. He repeated the central bank will intervene if
necessary, adding he did not think a dollar free-fall was
likely.
    But Sumita said he could not say exactly what currency
levels would be considered in line with underlying economic
fundamentals.
    In Paris on February 22, Britain, Canada, France, Japan,
the U.S. And West Germany agreed to cooperate to hold
currencies around their then current levels.
    Sumita said he could not find any specific reasons behind
the fall of the dollar to a record low against the yen
yesterday. But he said the market rushed to sell dollars as it
nervously reacted to statements abroad and to developments
surrounding trade tensions.
    U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker said over the weekend
that the Paris pact did not encompass fixed tragets for the
dollar. U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter called
U.S/Japan relations on certain key trade issues very strained.
    The market reacted nervously because the dollar has been
moving narrowly against the yen since mid-January, Sumita said.
He added he does not expect the yen/dollar exchange rate to
remain unstable because the market is concerned about a sharp
rise of the yen.
    The Bank of Japan will keep a close watch on exchange rates
in line with the Paris accord, he added.

The yen could rise to 140 yen to the
dollar, a leading Japanese businessman said.
    Bumpei Otsuki, president of the influential Japan
Federation of Employers' Associations, (Nikkeiren), told
reporters: "The yen might rise as far as 140 (to the dollar).
The U.S. Economy is not good, and as long as the U.S. Economy
is not good, the U.S. Will put various pressures (on Japan)."
    "The yen's level depends on the condition of the U.S.
Economy rather than Japan's economy, and as long as the
American situation is bad, the yen will continue to rise," he
said.
    To cope with the negative impact of the strong yen,
Japanese enterprises must strive to cut costs by all means,
including holding down wages as much as possible, Otsuki said.
    He rejected recent calls from some government quarters for
wage increases this year as a means of raising private
consumption and thus boosting domestic demand.
    "We have to keep wages as low as possible," he said.
    He also said the yen's large and rapid rise is depressing
the outlook for the Japanese economy, noting that in addition
to hurting exporters it is also damaging domestic market
manufacturers through cheap imports.
    Parts of the service sector are also threatened, Otsuki
said.
    Tertiary industries provide services to manufacturers and a
downturn in manufacturing profits will adversely affect service
industries, he said.
    It is also doubtful whether the tertiary sector can fully
employ those put out of work in the manufacturing sector, he
said.
    Profits of service sector companies are likely to fall in
the business year ending in March 1988, leading to a possible
recession in the Japanese economy, he said.
    Otsuki said economic growth is unlikely to pick up beyond
levels experienced in 1986.
    The government's Economic Planning Agency said last week
the economy grew at 2.5 pct in 1986, the worst performance
since 1974 when the economy shrank 1.4 pct due to the first oil
price crisis.
    In order to stimulate domestic demand and boost the
economy, tax reforms aimed at bringing down the cost of land
and reforming the nation's housing stock are needed, along with
steps to bring down the high cost of commodities, he said.

Guinness Plc <GUIN.L> will seek an

former Chairman Ernest Saunders in its attempts to recover 5.2
mln stg paid to a Jersey company as part of the company's
takeover battle for <Distillers Co Plc>, a spokesman said.
    He said the court move aimed to freeze Saunders' assets up

whether the court would reach any decision on the request
today. Guinness said last week it planned to take legal action
to recover the funds, paid to non-executive director Thomas

Nippon Steel Corp <NSTC.T> plans to
reduce its dividend to three yen in the year ending March 31
1987 from the five yen of 1985/86, a company spokesman said.
    The company estimated parent company current losses at 15
billion yen in 1986/87, including a gain of 95 billion yen from
the sale of securities. This compares with a 36.07 billion yen
profit a year earlier.
    Sales in 1986/87 are seen at 2,150 billion yen, down from
2,685 billion a year ago.
    Poor business prospects were attributed to the yen's rise
and slow world steel demand. Nippon is expected to report
parent company results in late May.
    Total 1986/87 crude steel production is estimated at 25.57
mln tonnes, down from 27.98 mln a year earlier.
    Crude steel production is likely to be below 1986/87 output
but forecasts for profits and sales in the year starting April
1 are unavailable yet, he said.

A strong performance from all BAT
Industries Plc's <BTI.L> major sectors enabled the group's 1986
pretax profits to pass the one billion stg level for the third
year running, Chairman Patrick Sheehy said in a statement.
    The group earlier reported a 19 pct rise in profits to 1.39
billion, which Sheehy said was achieved without any help from
exchange rate fluctuations or acquisitions.
    Good results were achieved by its Argos and Saks Fifth
Avenue in retailing and by Wiggins Teape and Appleton in paper.
    Tobacco accounted for about 50 pct of profit with a four
pct gain to 764 mln stg and a two pct increase in world volume.
    The results were largely in line with analysts expectations
and BAT shares firmed by two pence to 537p at 0955 GMT.
    BAT said the U.S. Brown and Williamson unit held most of
its 1985 gains and increased profit 18 pct in dollar terms.
    Financial services saw profits double to 282 mln with both
Eagle Star and Allied Dunbar achieving further growth.
    Allied Dunbar reported a 51 pct rise in life annual
premiums to 39 mln stg. BAT said it increased new business by
38 pct in the last nine months after a relatively slow first
quarter. Its permanent health insurance was now the market
leader and its Unit Trust group was now the second largest in
the U.K.
    Eagle Star general premiums rose 32 pct to 1.03 billion.
Its life activities also grew 39 pct with better underwriting
results in the second half.
    Cash flow was strong and the gross debt to equity ratio
dropped to 41 pct from 51 pct. The net ratio, at 26 pct, left
the group strongly placed to pursue its further development.
    Profits from paper and pulp grew 29 pct to 217 mln stg,
nearly three times the 1982 level, with Wiggins Teape's sales
rising 36 pct to pass one billion stg.
    BAT said in 1986 it had sold 88 BATUS stores in the U.S.
For 644 mln dlrs and sold Grovewood Securities for 142 mln stg.

Kloeckner & Co KGaA, the
international trading group, said its 1986 domestic group net
profit fell by around 20 pct against 1985, adding that the
profit resulted largely from a writing back of reserves.
    The company, which gave no 1986 profit figures, posted a
domestic group net profit of 41 mln marks in 1985.
    It said the 1986 profit was made possible through a 40 mln
mark write-back of reserves that had been created to cover
possible price rises. These reserves were no longer necessary
because of recent declines in raw material prices.
    Kloeckner attributed the profit decline to the fall in
prices as well as the lower value of the dollar.
    It said it would pay an unchanged dividend on its ordinary
share capital, which is entirely in private hands and held
largely by family foundations.
    Kloeckner's nominal 100 mark profit-participation
certificates, issued in October 1986, will pay a likely yield
of around 10 pct. Holders of the certificates are entitled to a
quarter of the 1986 payment, or around 2.50 marks, the company
added.

Considerable uncertainty surrounds the

noting it remains overshadowed by European operator threats to

Commission will authorise any exports at all or grant licences
on a large tonnage.
    The subsidy is seen being set above 45.00 Ecus per 100
kilos, although traders are reluctant to predict a precise
level after prices fell yesterday.
    Earlier, traders in Paris said they expected the Commission
to award licences for around 50,000 tonnes of white sugar with
a maximum export rebate of 45.75 to 46.0 Ecus.

60,500 tonnes of whites at a maximum rebate of 44.819.

The yen could rise to 140 yen to the
dollar, a leading Japanese businessman said.
    Bumpei Otsuki, president of the influential Japan
Federation of Employers' Associations, (Nikkeiren), told
reporters: "The yen might rise as far as 140 (to the dollar).
The U.S. Economy is not good, and as long as the U.S. Economy
is not good, the U.S. Will put various pressures (on Japan)."
    "The yen's level depends on the condition of the U.S.
Economy rather than Japan's economy, and as long as the
American situation is bad, the yen will continue to rise," he
said.
    To cope with the negative impact of the strong yen,
Japanese enterprises must strive to cut costs by all means,
including holding down wages as much as possible, Otsuki said.
    He rejected recent calls from some government quarters for
wage increases this year as a means of raising private
consumption and thus boosting domestic demand.
    "We have to keep wages as low as possible," he said.
    He also said the yen's large and rapid rise is depressing
the outlook for the Japanese economy, noting that in addition
to hurting exporters it is also damaging domestic market
manufacturers through cheap imports.
    Parts of the service sector are also threatened, Otsuki
said.
    Tertiary industries provide services to manufacturers and a
downturn in manufacturing profits will adversely affect service
industries, he said.
    It is also doubtful whether the tertiary sector can fully
employ those put out of work in the manufacturing sector, he
said.
    Profits of service sector companies are likely to fall in
the business year ending in March 1988, leading to a possible
recession in the Japanese economy, he said.
    Otsuki said economic growth is unlikely to pick up beyond
levels experienced in 1986.
    The government's Economic Planning Agency said last week
the economy grew at 2.5 pct in 1986, the worst performance
since 1974 when the economy shrank 1.4 pct due to the first oil
price crisis.
    In order to stimulate domestic demand and boost the
economy, tax reforms aimed at bringing down the cost of land
and reforming the nation's housing stock are needed, along with
steps to bring down the high cost of commodities, he said.

Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita
said that current exchange rates are almost within the levels
agreed to by six major nations last month in Paris.
    Asked whether a dollar/yen rate of 148 or 149 reflected
economic fundamentals, he said current rates almost reflect
fundamentals.
    Sumita told reporters major nations have cooperated to
bring about currency stability in line with the Paris
agreement, which stipulated that they would closely cooperate
to that end. He repeated the central bank will intervene if
necessary, adding he did not think a dollar free-fall was
likely.
    But Sumita said he could not say exactly what currency
levels would be considered in line with underlying economic
fundamentals.
    In Paris on February 22, Britain, Canada, France, Japan,
the U.S. And West Germany agreed to cooperate to hold
currencies around their then current levels.
    Sumita said he could not find any specific reasons behind
the fall of the dollar to a record low against the yen
yesterday. But he said the market rushed to sell dollars as it
nervously reacted to statements abroad and to developments
surrounding trade tensions.
    U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker said over the weekend
that the Paris pact did not encompass fixed tragets for the
dollar. U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter called
U.S/Japan relations on certain key trade issues very strained.
    The market reacted nervously because the dollar has been
moving narrowly against the yen since mid-January, Sumita said.
He added he does not expect the yen/dollar exchange rate to
remain unstable because the market is concerned about a sharp
rise of the yen.
    The Bank of Japan will keep a close watch on exchange rates
in line with the Paris accord, he added.

The chances of U.K. Stocks continuing
recent rises as budget euphoria gives way to the uncertainties
of a probable election are small, and market analysts say there
will probably be a downwards correction in the next few weeks.
    The U.K. Market has managed a dizzy rise since the New
Year, with the FT-SE index of 100 leading shares lifting 22.5
pct since January 2 to current levels around 2050.
    "Over the next month or two the odds are that the index will
drop back to around 1,900," said John Goldschmidt, head of
equities research at Chase Manhattan Securities.
    "A five to 10 pct drop is likely. There was a six pct fall
before the 1983 election when the Conservatives were further
ahead in the polls and the market was on a multiple of only 14
instead of 18 now," noted Nick Knight of brokers James Capel.
    "The old adage is "sell in May and go away'. That's likely to
apply this year but will probably start in April," he added.
    But few analysts believed a correction would spell the end
of the bull run that has now lasted for some six years.
    "As long as corporate profits and earnings keep on growing
then the pressure for continued rises will be there. There
seems little prospect of the growth stopping in 1987/1988," one
said.
    Much of the recent enthusiasm has stemmed from the belief,
already virtually discounted, that the ruling Conservatives
will call an election in the next few months - probably June -
and sweep home to a third term in office.
    Even if this does happen, however, pre-election nerves are
likely to produce the traditional effect of damping down the
market until the result is clear.
    "It's likely there will be one or two hiccups of confidence
about the Tories winning an overall majority," Goldschmidt said.
    "It would be quite out of character for the market to
continue to sail serenely upwards right through the election
and beyond," added brokers Phillips and Drew in a recent report.
    The belief that the government itself is worried about the
impact of the Alliance party disrupting the usual two-corner
fight of Conservative and Labour with unpredictable results, is
not likely to give reassurance, one analyst noted.
    Other factors also indicate that the market is vulnerable
to a downwards correction. U.K. Stocks had ridden up partly on
the back of record rises in New York and Japan and a pause in
either suggests that London would inevitably follow suit.
    There would also be little new encouragement provided by
general economic factors as much of the recent optimistic news,
including this month's half point cut in base rates to 10 pct,
is already built into prices.
    "The economy is looking okay, but it can't support 20 pct
increases every three months indefinitely," one said.
    Also, market liquidity, a powerful driving force behind the
recent rises, shows signs of drying up under the pressure of
the government's privatisation campaign.
    The next few months will see cash calls for second tranche
payments on British Gas Plc <BRGS.L> and British Airways Plc
<BAB.L> as well as the proposed sale of <Rolls Royce Plc> and
the as-yet untimetabled sale of the government's 31.7 pct stake
in British Petroleum Co Plc <BP.L>.
    On top of that, there will be calls from the gilt market
even though last week's budget limited the projected 1987/88
borrowing requirement to four billion stg.
    "We are looking for a squeeze on cash flow, and that's not
including rights issues which have been low so far this year
and may pick up in the second quarter," Knight said.

A unit of Inspectorate International
AG <INSZ.Z> is raising 200 mln marks through an equity warrant
eurobond package with a two pct coupon priced at par, lead
manager Schweizerische Bankverein (Deutschland) AG said.
    The five-year bond, for Inspectorate International Finance
NV, gives investors options on two separate warrant series "A"
and "B" exercisable into participation certificates in parent and
guarantor Inspectorate International AG.
    The first "A" series carries warrants for four participation
certificates. Upon exercising the "A" warrants, investors also
get two warrants for the "B" series.
    The "A" exercise period runs from May 7, 1987, to August 6,
1987. The exercise price is 543 Swiss francs.
    Of the two "B" warrants, one entitles investors to purchase
one participation certificate in Inspectorate International AG
and the other provides seven warrants.
    Investors may pay for "B" participation certificates by
redeeming the bond issued today. In this case, the bond, issued
in denominations of 5,000 marks, will be valued at a fixed
price of 4,200 Swiss francs, or 119.05 francs per 100 marks.
    Participation certificates acquired with "B" warrants will be
priced at 597 francs, equalling the price of the first tranche,
plus a 10 pct premium. The exercise period for the "B" series is
from August 8, 1987 to May 5, 1991.
    Fees for the bond total 2-1/4 pct, with 1-1/2 points for
selling, and 1-3/4 for management and underwriting combined.
    Investors will pay for the bond on April 8, and the bond
pays annual interest on the same day. It matures on April 8,
1992. The bond and warrants will be listed in Frankfurt.
    If all participation share warrants are exercised, the
company will obtain some 300 mln marks in new equity.
    The construction allows Inspectorate to borrow at lower
cost than a comparable convertible bond and will give the
Inspectorate equity through issues of participation
certificates in West Germany, a Swiss Bank Corp spokesman said.
    Inspectorate requires funding to finance its purchase of a
51 pct stake in Harpener AG, a diversified West German group,
and other recent acquisitions.

The Bundesbank bought large amounts
of dollars for yen in an apparent attempt to hold the dollar
above 149 yen, dealers said.
    The dollar intervention was in concert with some other
central banks, they said.
    Dealers said the Bank of Japan and Bank of England
supported the dollar against the yen earlier today and that
these two banks and the U.S. Federal Reserve were also active
yesterday.
    The Bundesbank declined to comment on the dealers' remarks.
    Dealers said the intervention underlined the determination
of central banks to keep currencies within recent ranges
following last month's agreement in Paris by six leading
countries to foster currency stability.
    One dealer said he had been repeatedly in contact with the
Bundesbank during the morning to see if it wanted to buy
dollars after the Japanese and U.K. Central bank moves.
    He said the Bundesbank told him it was observing the
situation to see if it should intervene in consultation with
other central banks.
    Since the Paris agreement on February 22 the dollar had
until yesterday traded in a 1.8150-1.8700 mark range, and above
150 yen, with traders reluctant to push the dollar down to test
central banks' resolve to defend currency stability.
    But the test came this week with the dollar falling below
1.81 marks and 150 yen. Dealers said a reviving trade dispute
between Washington and Tokyo and growing sentiment that the
dollar would have to fall further to narrow the obstinate U.S.
Trade deficit were behind the weakness.
    This week's intervention showed central banks were prepared
to cooperate to defend the Paris pact, dealers said.
    Dealers said it was significant the West German and British
central banks were supporting the dollar against the yen.
    That showed the pact involved multilateral cooperation by
central banks to foster currency stability, they said.
    But it was unclear how such cooperation was being arranged
and how frequent consultations between central banks were.

1.7 billion dlr asset subsidiary which will operate under the

A total 59,000 tonnes of current series
white sugar received export rebates of a maximum 45.678
European Currency Units (Ecus) per 100 kilos at today's

said.
    Out of this, traders in West Germany received 34,750
tonnes, in the U.K. 13,000, in Denmark 7,250 and in France
4,000 tonnes, it added.
    Earlier today, London traders had expected the subsidy for
the current season whites campaign for licences to end-Aug to
be more than 45.00 Ecus per 100 kilos but Paris traders were
more precise by forecasting a rebate level of 45.75 to 46.0
Ecus.
    London traders were also reluctant earlier to predict the
likely tonnage to be authorised for export in view of the
on-going dispute between the Commission and European producers
over the threatened action by the producers to move over
800,000 tonnes to intervention.
    Last week saw 60,500 tonnes whites athuorised for export at

Utilicorp United Corp
said it expects to report 1987 first quarter earnings of about
12 mln dlrs or about 1.12 dlrs a share and revenues of about
190 mln dlrs.
    In the comparable quarter a year ago, Utilicorp earned 8.5
mln dlrs or 87 cts on revenues of 203 mln dlrs.
    There are 9.6 mln shares outstanding this year, up from the
8.5 mln shares in 1986, Utilicorp's president Richard Green
told financial analysts here.
    First quarter 1987 results include one month contribution
of West Virginia Power, which became a division on March 1,
1987, Green said in remarks prepared for delivery to analysts.
    Higher earnings for the period reflected reduced operating
and maintenenace expenses and about 10 mln dlrs in rate
increases in Iowa, Minnesota, Kansas and Colorado, he said.
    However, Utilicorp's Missouri Public Service division is
experiencing the effect of a 5.9 pct rate reduction authorized
in September 1986, he noted.
    Of Utilicorp's total revenues expected for the 1987 first
quarter, about 43 mln dlrs will be derived from electric
operations and about 147 mln dlrs will come from gas
operations, he said.
    Operating income derived from electric operations in the
first three months of 1987 is estimated to be eight mln dlrs,
while the contribution from gas operations will be about 10 mln
dlrs, Green said.
    Green told analysts that Utilicorp received regulatory
approval from various states and the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission to reincorporate in Delaware, effective April one.
    Utilicorp signed an agreement with Cominco Ltd of Vancouver
to extend the deadline to May 31, 1987, for completion of the
company's purchase of West Kootenay Power and Light of British
Columbia, due to a longer than expected regulatory approval
process, he said.

Bristol-Myers Co said it has filed an
investigational new drug application with the U.S. Food and

testing its AIDS vaccine in humans.
    The company said it filed the application on behalf of its
Oncogen subsidiary, which developed the vaccine. It did not
name the drug.
    Bristol-Myers, the third largest drug company in the U.S.,
said that "considerable work remains to be done before it is
determined whether a new drug application will be develpoed for
submission to FDA."
    An investigational new drug application is the first step
in testing an agent. After clinical studies establish the
safety and efficacy of an agent, a company then submits a new
drug application to the FDA. It may take three to five years
before a new drug application is submitted and another two to
three years before the FDA approves a drug for marketing.
    Earlier this month, Bristol-Myers said the vaccine produced
antibodies to the AIDS virus in mice and monkeys. The vaccine
uses a live smallpox vaccine to carry two protein on the AIDS
virus that may, in theory, prod the immune system to produce
neutralizaing antibodies against AIDS.
    The company is the second U.S. organization that has sought
premission for human testing of an AIDS vaccine. At team headed
by Allan Goldstein of George Washington University in
Washington was the first.

The Federal Reserve Board
unanimously approved a proposal to allow Federal Reserve banks
to offer a redeposit service for bounced checks.
    The service would allow a commercial bank that sends checks
to a reserve bank for collection to instruct the reserve bank
to redeposit a bounced check rather than return it.
    The reserve banks would be required to charge a fee for the
redeposit service that would cover its costs.
    The plan would leave it to each reserve bank to set a
dollar cutoff for eligible returns.
    The Fed acted after industry studies showed that nearly
two-thirds of bounced checks cleared the second time around.

more than 40 billion checks written each year in the United

<Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc> said
some Wall Street firms have limited their commodities trading
business with Drexel.
    Rumors circulated in financial and commodity markets
yesterday that units of <Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc>, Salomon
Inc <SB> and <Goldman, Sachs and Co> had restricted commodities
business with Drexel because of its involvement in the
government's insider trading probe.
    In response to questions, a Drexel spokesman said, "Any

those few competitors who have instituted restrictions for
whatever their motives well know."
    Securities industry sources said the three firms were
restricting their business with Drexel particularly in oil and
precious metals. The firms have restricted business in some
areas, but not others, the sources said.
    All three firms declined to comment, and the Drexel
spokesman did not identify the companies by name.
    Drexel and some officials, including Michael Milken, head
of its "junk bond" department, were subpoenaed following the
government's settlement of insider trading charges against
arbitrager Ivan Boesky.

Fiat Spa <FIAT.MI> is considering
issuing a eurobond of up to 384 mln dlrs, convertible or with
warrants attached for exercise into its shares still with banks
after the placement of the Libyan stake last autumn, the
financial daily Handelsblatt reported, quoting bourse sources.
    The newspaper gave no other details. But dealers said
shares of Deutsche Bank AG <DBKG.F> had been strong in recent
days, partly on hopes that the issue would allow the bank to
place its Fiat quota with investors at a reasonable price.
    Deutsche was lead underwriter for the 2.13 billion dlr Fiat
placement, announced on September 23.
    In Milan, a Fiat spokesman had no comment on the reports.
    A Deutsche Bank spokesman here said he had no knowledge of
a possible equity-linked Fiat bond. But German banking sources
said concern the bank had to take a hefty writedown for its
unplaced Fiat stock had weighed heavily on its share price.
    Milan share dealers also said Fiat stock had been under
pressure since the placement. Ordinary shares rose 20 lire to
12,880 today, but were well down from 16,600 on September 23.
    Sources close to Italian state-owned investment bank IMI
said earlier this month that a convertible issue was being

<Greenwood Resources Inc> 
said if it is unsuccessful in gaining shareholder approval for
a debt refinancing with Colorado National Bankshares Inc
<COLC>, the bank will have the right to foreclose on
Greenwood's assets.
    On January 28, Greenwood's board approved an agreement with
Colorado National calling for the sale of 4,300,000 shares of
New London Oil owned by Greenwood for 1,700,000 dlrs and
calling for a restructuring and recapitalizing of Greenwood,
subject to shareholder approval.
    As a result of declines in the value of oil and natural gas
properties brought on by the fall in prices for those fuels,
Greenwood started facing substantial bank debt prepayment
requirements in 1986.
    The New London shares are to be sold to a party in London.
    On February 1, Colorado National released to the company
all cash flow from oil and natural gas operations and reduced
its debt in return for the payment of 1,700,000 dlrs from the
sale of the New London stock and other considerations.  Eighty
pct of Greenwood's cash flow from oil and gas operations had
been allocated to servicing debt to the bank.
    Under the deal with Colorado National, existing preferred
and common stocks would be converted into a new common stock,
subject to shareholder approval.
    The company said it expects to file proxy materials for the
special meeting of shareholders at which the matter will be
considered by the first week of April, mail material to
shareholders by early May and schedule the meeting for about 30
days thereafter.
    It said its 1985 audit -- not conducted at the end of that
year due to lack of funds -- is being conducted now, along with
the 1986 audit, by Touche Ross and Co.
    Greenwood said as soon as its 1985 audit is completed, it
will apply for readmission to the NASDAQ system, from which it
was delisted last year.
    It also said it probably plans to change its name to
Greenwood Holdings due to its planned redirection from natural

The U.S. Senate Agriculture
Committee approved a bill that would establish farm trade and
aid missions to promote the use of U.S. food aid, donation,
credit and export subsidy programs by overseas customers.
    The bill, approved by voice vote, would establish trade
missions made up of representatives of the Departments of
Agriculture and State, the Agency for International
Development, the Overseas Private Investment Corp, market
development cooperatives and private voluntary organizations.
    At least 16 missions would have to be sent within one year
after enactment of the bill. The missions would promote U.S.
programs, including PL480, Section 416 donations, Export
Enhancement Program, the dairy export incentive program, and
export credit guarantee programs (GSM-102, GSM-103).
    The panel agreed to drop a provision in the original bill,
offered by Sen. John Melcher (D-Mont.), that would have
required the U.S. Agriculture Department to donate at least one
mln tonnes of surplus commodities to developing countries.
    Current law requires USDA to donate at least 750,000 tonnes
of surplus grains and dairy products under the Section 416 food
donation program.
    The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the proposed
increase in the minimum tonnage requirement would have cost up
to 50 mln dlrs per year, Senate staff said.
    The committee also dropped a provision identifying which
countries would be the focus of the trade missions' activities.
    Under the bill adopted by the committee, countries "friendly
to the United States" would be eligible to host the trade
missions.
    Melcher originally had proposed sending missions to Mexico,
the Philippines, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Senegal, Nigeria, Peru,
Kenya, the Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, Malaysia, Venezuela,
Tunisia and Morocco.
    The bill also would require the Foreign Agricultural
Service, FAS, to have at least 850 full-time employees during
fiscal years 1987-89. As of February 28, FAS had 790 full-time
employees, a FAS spokesman said.

BAT Industries Plc <BTI.L> 1986 results,
which were at the upper end of market expectations, showed the
company was in a strong position and that its shares were
probably undervalued, share analysts said.
    BAT shares were down at 524p in late afternoon trading
after a previous 535p close. They touched a high of 538p
earlier on news of a 19 pct rise in annual profits to 1.39
billion pre-tax.
    Stock market analysts said today's generally weak stock
market plus unwinding of positions after heavy buying of BAT
shares in the run-up to the results caused the fall in the
share price.
    "In the current market, people almost expect companies to
beat expectations," said one analyst, adding that pretax profits
of 1.35 to 1.40 billion stg had been forecast.
    BAT's 1986 figure of 1.39 billion stg compared with a 1985
pretax profit of 1.17 billion.
    Brokers noted that BAT's shift away from its
underperforming industries and the decreasing share of the
tobacco portion of the group were seen as good signs.
    BAT Chairman Patrick Sheehy told a news conference that the
tobacco sector of the company had declined to 50 pct from 74
pct four years ago.
    Sheehy said he could see the tobacco portion of the company
declining further as other sectors increased in importance.
    He said BAT was looking to expand in the area of financial
services, in particular in the U.S.
    Sheehy also said the group had "no sizeable acquisitions" in
sight in the near future.
    Analysts said BAT's increasingly good performance in the
U.K. Insurance area was encouraging.
    Its declining debt-to-equity ratio of currently about 16
pct also made it likely that BAT would soon be looking to make
major acquisitions, they said.

Energy Secretary John Herrington has
proposed several ways to boost U.S. oil production, but he said
all would cost the Treasury money and will come under close
White House scrutiny before action is taken.
    One measure he said he favored would raise the depletion
allowance to 27.5 pct on new oil and gas production as well as
production using enhanced extraction methods.
    Herrington said such a plan would cost 200 mln dlrs a year.
The White House, reacting, said it did not favor amending the
tax code, but would look at the proposal.
    Herrington's proposals to spur production were made along
with the release last week of the energy department's report on
energy and the national security.
    The report said U.S. oil imports, rapidly rising, could hit
50 pct by the mid 1990s and have potentially damaging
implications for national security.
    He has said since in speeches and at news conferences that
any plan he would back to spur lagging domestic oil production
would have to meet three criteria--increase production, not
cause economic dislocation, and be low cost to the taxpayer.
    Herrington said an import fee would meet the first test,
spurring production but fail the second and third.
    He said it would raise production and return 120,000 oil 
workers to their jobs, but at the same time it lifted oil
prices, the higher prices would cost 400,000 jobs nationwide
and cut the gross national product by 32 billion dlrs.
    A tax on gasoline, he said, would fail the first criteria
by not increasing domestic production.
    In any case, U.S. officials say, President Reagan remains
firmly opposed to an import fee and a gasoline tax.
    Options which meet Herrington's criteria include:
    - Loan-price guarantees to shield banks from defaults by
borrowers because of lower oil prices. It was estimated that if
oil fell to five dlrs a barrel it could trigger defaults that
could cost the government an estimated 15 billion dlrs.
    - A five pct tax credit for exploration and development. It
would raise oil and gas production the equivalent of 325,000
barrels a day, at a cost of 740 mln dlrs a year.
    - A five pct credit only for geological and geophysical
expenditures. It would increase production by 80,000 barrels a
day, at a cost of 65 mln dlrs.
    - Lower bid minimums on outer continental shelf acreage to
spur exploration. A drop from the present 150 dlrs per acre for
the typical 5,760 acre tract to 25 dlrs per acre would lower
the cost of the standard tract lease to 144,000 dlrs.
    Herrington also pressed anew for existing Administration
proposals to deregulate natural gas, which he said would cut
the need for imported oil by 300,000 barrels daily.
    He also called again for Congressional approval to explore
off the continental shelf, which may hold more than 12 billion
barrels of oil, and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which
may hold nine billion barrels.
    Herrington said he understood the Reagan's reluctance to 
amend the newly enacted tax code to fund some of these
proposals, but added he hoped his department's energy/security
study would make a strong case for the need to help the
struggling domestic oil industry.
    Another move Herrington said he will press anew, even
though it had been rejected earlier by the White House, is to
raise the fill-rate for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to
100,000 barrels a day from its planned 1988 rate of 35,000.
    This, he said, would further bolster national security in
case of an oil-supply disruption.

Todd Shipyards Corp said it
omitted payment of the quarterly dividend on its common stock
and lowered the dividend on its series A preferred stock to 75
cts from 77 cts a share.
    Todd said the 75 ct preferred dividend will be paid May one
to shareholders of record April 15.
    The company said it omitted the common dividend to cover
both losses from a commercial ship conversion contract and
increased reserves for previously announced discontinued
shipyard operations.
    In addition, the company said its lenders agreed to
temporarily reduce the net worth requirement of its revolving
credit and term-loan pact to 140 mln dlrs from 130 mln.
    The reduction will hold through May 15, it said.
    Todd said the reduction in the net worth requirement
allowed for the payment of the preferred dividend and prevented
it from violating covenants of its credit agreement.
    The company said it is also negotiating with its lenders to
extend the reduced net worth terms beyond May 15.
    Todd added that it has suffered financially because of the
U.S. Navy's unwillingness to release certain retentions under
completed ship construction contracts and a general decrease in

Gould Inc said it is introducing a new
generation of very high performance mini supercomputers for
intensive engineering applications.
    Called the NPL, the mini supercomputers use Gould's UTX/32
operating system, which is a compatible multi-processor
extension of the UNIX operating system consisting of complete
AT and T System V and Berkeley BSD 4.3 environments, company
officials said at a teleconference.
    "The introduction of the NPL family of mini supercomputers,
is by far Gould's most significant computer line developed to
date," chairman James McDonald said.
    Patrick Rickard, computer systems president, said that he
expects sales of NPL family computers to account for 20 pct of
the division's revenues for the first year after its
introduction, and increase to 80 pct of revenues in five years.
    Computer operations accounted for one third or about 300
mln dlrs of Gould's total revenues for 1986 of 908.8 mln dlrs,
a company spokesman said.
    The NP1, the first series of the new family, uses an open
systems architecture, including parallel and high speed vector
processing and "massive" memory to achieve its supercomputing
capability, Gould officers said.
    The NP1 family will form the foundation for new systems
which are expected to be brought to market through the 1990s,
McDonald said.
    The computers are expected to have applications in science
and engineering, in aerospace and defense and extend into other
areas such as medical sciences, Rick Baron, senior director of
marketing development said.
    Gould said it priced and packaged the NP1 at a cost which
will provide the power and advantages of a traditional
supercomputer at a fraction of the cost.
    The NP1 product line includes several models priced from
395,000 dlrs to 2.9 mln dlrs, Gould officials said adding that
the company has already signed orders for eight NP1 systems.
    The low-end NP1 models will be available in the 1987 third
quarter and the high-end will be available in the 1988 first
quarter, they said.
    According to Gould officials, the NP1 cost 50 mln dlrs to
develop and the company plans to spend between 100 to 150 mln
to develop the rest of the family line. Between now and 1995,
the company expects to ship two to three billion dlrs of NP1
mini supercomputers.
    Offering up to 96 mln Whetstone instructions per second and
320 mln floating point operations per second, the largest of
the new systems, Model 480, incorporates up to four billion
bytes of physical memory, they said.
    The NP1 family has connectability but not compatability
with IBM and Xerox computers, a company spokesman said.

Canada's federal government
will provide a 350 mln dlr oil industry aid package that
includes cash incentives designed to cover one-third of a
company's oil and gas exploration and development costs, Energy
Minister Marcel Masse announced.
    The aid program will inject about 350 mln dlrs a year into
the oil and gas industry and could lead to more than one
billion dlrs in new investment, Masse told a news conference.
    The program will affect drilling done anywhere in Canada on
or after April 1, 1987.
    Masse told reporters that the government's oil industry aid
package is aimed at small and medium sized companies.
    The aid package, called the Canadian Exploration and
Development Incentive Program, will restrict the total payments
that any individual company can claim to 10 mln dlrs a year.
    Masse said the program will probably generate new
employment equivalent to 20,000 people working for a year.
    He said oil industry aid is needed because exploration and
development spending dropped by at least 50 pct since world oil
prices fell during the first half of 1986.
    Energy Minister Masse said the federal government decided
to provide cash incentives so a large number of non-tax paying
companies, mainly small Canadian firms, will receive the full
value of the incentive. Such companies would not immediately
benefit from tax benefits, he said.
    The federal government also wanted to deliver an aid
program outside the tax system. Finance Minister Michael Wilson
is now reviewing Canada's tax system and plans to announce tax
reform proposals later this spring.
    An important feature of the aid program is a decision to
let companies issue flow-through shares, allowing investors to
benefit from the subsidy rather than restricting benefits to
only participating companies, he said.
    Allowing flow-through shares under the program will make it
easier for companies to attract investors in exploration and
development, Masse said.
    He told reporters his department is still considering
whether to allow partnerships and other entities to qualify for
the subsidy.

Navistar International Corp expects its
fiscal 1987 capital spending to rise to 100 mln dlrs, up from
74 mln dlrs a year ago, Chairman-elect James Cotting told
reporters after the annual meeting.
    Cotting said much of the spending will go toward
modernization of the company''s painting operations at its
Springfield, Ohio truck assembly plant. The balance will be
used to increase productivity at its various facilities.
    In answer to a question, Neil Springer, who on April 1
becomes chairman of the company's new truck and engine holding
company, Navistar International Transportation Corp, said the
company's goal is to reduce costs 25 pct by 1990.
    Noting that purchased material now accounts for 81 pct of
its cost of production, Springer said Navistar intends to enter
similar relationships to one it has with Dana Corp <CDN>, in
which the two companies are coordinating design, manufacture,
distribution and service of components to cut costs.
    Springer said because of overcapacity in some sectors,
price discounting will continue to plague the truck
manufacturing industry.
    He said the heavy truck industry is operating at 65 pct of
capacity, up 10 pct from a year ago with medium truck operating
at 73 pct of capacity, about level with a year ago.
    Springer said Navistar itself is operating at "over 70 pct
of capacity" in heavy trucks and at more than 90 pct in medium
trucks.
    Asked when Navistar would begin making acquisitions,
Springer said "We're ready now, but we have no specific
timetable."

Pacific Gas and Electric Co said
it will ask the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to change
federal regulations requiring the utility to buy electricity
from unregulated private producers.
    Prices paid for this power under long term contracts signed
before last year's fall in world oil prices now are more than
twice as high as the actual value of the electricity, Pacific
Gas said.
    Under the 1978 Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act
utilities are required to buy electricity from cogeneration
facilities, which produce both steam and electricity.
    Since 1980, Pacific Gas has signed power purchase
agreements, required by the law, with long-term price
guarantees for more than 8,480 megawatts of capacity from
private producers, the company said.
    About 1,870 MW of that capacity is already on line, and
accounted for about eight pct of the company's total energy
sales in 1986, Pacific Gas said.
    The company said it will ask FERC to amend the rules
requiring purchase of this power so that the price paid for the
electricity reflects current market values, and that utilities
be required to buy only electricity needed in the near term.
    Contracts with cogeneration and other small power projects
could cost Pacific Gas' consumers as much as 857 mln dlrs
annually by 1990, the company said.
    The 857 mln dlrs represents the difference between what
Pacific Gas would pay for power from private producers and the
cost to the company to produce the power on its own or buy it
elsewhere, Pacific Gas said.

Middle South Utilities Inc is taking a
conversative approach to formulating a new common stock
dividend policy, chairman Edwin Lupberger said.
    He told securities analysts that when the company's common
dividend is resumed, "the initial rate will appear conservative
to you by industry standards and in relation MSU's net income
and cash flow."
    "Our progress will determine how soon we can reinstate a
dividend to our common stockholders, he said."
    The company last paid a common dividend of 44.5 cts a share
in July 1985.
    Lupberger told the analysts that the company's primary
objective is "to create financial strength, enough strength so
that what happened to us and our stockholders over the past
couple of years never happens again."
    The company has faced regulatory challenges to rates
proposed to cover the cost of its Grand Gulf nuclear plant.
    He said Middle South's net income is expected to post
"modest growth" over the next three years.
    In 1986, the company earned 451.3 mln dlrs or 2.21 dlrs a
share on revenues of 3.49 billion dlrs.
    Lupberger said, "A good portion of the improvement
projected for the next three years comes from keeping the lid
on operating and maintenance expenses."

it expects first quarter earnings to be 20 to 25 pct below the

debt incurred for the AccuRay acquisition, to finance other
costs of the transaction and for general corporate purposes.
    Combustion said 3,500,000 shares will be sold in the U.S.

    Combustion paid about 218 mln dlrs for AccuRay, a maker of
computer-based measurement and control systems used in pulp and

results in the third week in April.

    Combustion said the restructuring at Lummus Crest is

losses in the Engineering and Construction segment.

approximately offset by a number of factors, including a
somewhat lower level of earnings in the Power Generation

acquisition, costs associated with integrating AccuRay

Stocks of tobacco companies rose
sharply as investors grew more confident that an excise tax
would not be imposed on tobacco, traders and analysts said.
    They also said the stocks are relatively inexpensive since
fear of the tax and of pending litigation regarding warning
labels for tobacco products have kept many investors away
recently.
    Philip Morris Cos <MO> rose 2-5/8 to 87-3/4, RJR Nabisco
<RJR> 1-1/4 to 57-1/2 and U.S. Tobacco <UBO> 7/8 to 27.
    "The near-term activity of these stocks has been dominated
by external factors such as smoking restriction legislation,
concern over liability suits and the possible imposition of
excise taxes," Dean Witter analyst Lawrence Adelman said. "But
the feeling is that many of those externals have been
discounted in the price of the stocks."
    Adelman, who issued a positive recommendation on Philip
Morris earlier this week, said there have been indications that
the Reagan Administration's staunch opposition to tax hikes
would short-circuit attempts to tax tobacco.
    "The tobaccos do have more risks than regular consumer
stocks because of these external factors," Adelman said. "They
are not for the weak-hearted, but they offer a lot of value for
the aggressive investor."
    In a market where everyone is looking for affordable
stocks, trader Drew Schaefer of Kidder Peabody said, it is not
hard to understand why the tobaccos, which have been depressed
for a while in a positive market, are attracting buyers.
    Adelman believes one of the better buys is Philip Morris.
"It is a powerhouse of potential growth in earnings, dividends
and free cash flow. And the stock is cheap now," he said.
    Adelman expects Morris to earn eight dlrs a share this year
compared to 6.20 dlrs a share earned a year ago. In 1988, the
company should report a profit 10.30 dlrs a share.

Three men were charged today with
operating a large tax fraud scheme that provided more than 500
mln dlrs in phony tax losses for many prominent people,
including CBS Inc. <CBS> president Laurence Tisch and his
brother Preston, who is President Reagan's postmaster general.
    The indictment was handed down by a federal grand jury to
in New York.
    The three indicted were named as Charles Atkins, William
Hack and Ernest Grunebaum, all well-known promoters of tax
shelters. Atkins was well-known as an organizer of tax shelters
in the late 1970s and early 1980.
    The indictment said that between 1978 and 1983, the
defendants conspired to defraud the government by arranging
"rigged and fraudulent" transactions in governmenmt securities
and false tax deductions based on phony trading losses and
interest expenses.
    More than 350 mln dlrs in false deductions were passed on
to partners in three tax shelters.
    In addition, the defendants sold over 200 mln dlrs in phony
trading losses and interest expenses to other entities and
individuals to be used as tax deductions.
    The indictment said that over 1.1 billion dlrs in trading
losses and interest expenses were generated by the scheme but
were off-set by "fictious gains."
    Laurence Tisch was said by the indictment to have reported
a net loss of 1.1 mln dlrs. His brother, Preston Tisch,
reported a loss of 480,000 dlrs.
    None of the three men's clients were charged with any
criminal acts. But should the three be found guilty, their
clients will be required to pay taxes they originally avoided
through the tax shelter scheme, plus interest and possibly

U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard
Lyng said agriculture should share spending cuts under the
Gramm-Rudman law and that this would ultimately help exports.
    "There needs to be some reduction of some expenditures to at
least get close to the Gramm-Rudman figure," he said.
"Agriculture would not be independent from that."
    He told a Virginia Farm Bureau lunch, "I don't think anyone
believes we'll meet the 108 billion dlr target."
    Lyng said if the federal deficit came down, this would help
exports. "A failure to get the fiscal deficit under control is
having a harmful effect on agricultural exports."
    He added, however, that U.S. agricultural exports had
increased under the Farm Security Act but so far had not
recovered to what he called the successful levels of 1981.

Cyclops Corp said the three
members of its board appointed last week by <Dixons Group PLC>
had resigned and that it named three Cyclops executives to
replace them.
    Cyclops said the moves followed the announcement earlier
today by Dixons that it received only 20 pct of Cyclops
outstanding common stock under an extended tender offer that
expired yesterday.
    Dixons initially ended its 90.25 dlr a share tender offer
on March 17 after receiving 54 pct of Cyclops shares.
    However, the Securities and Exchange Commission last Friday
pressed Dixons to reopen the offer because the U.K.-based
company had dropped a condition that at least 80 pct of Cyclops
stock be tendered by the close of the offer.
    Dixons then extended the offer until yesterday and earlier
today indicated that a substantial number of tendered Cyclops
shares had been withdrawn, leaving it with only 852,000 shares,
or just over 20 pct of the roughly 4.26 mln Cyclops shares
outstanding.
    Dixons said today that it purchased the tendered shares,
which, when combined with the shares it already holds, gives it
a 21.7 pct stake in Cyclops.
    Cyclops said its reconstituted board includes the three
newly named directors and five outside directors, all of whom
were on the board prior to Dixons tender offer.
    The three Cyclops directors were replaced by Dixons
appointees on March 17 under an agreement reached between the

Strong competition remains in the
airline industry despite a recent wave of mergers, a
Transportation Department official said.
    But Assistant Transportation Secretary Matthew Scocozza
said at a Senate antitrust committee hearing he would not
object to a transfer of the department's authority over airline
mergers to the Justice Department.
    Scocozza and Deputy Assistant Attorney General Roger
Andewelt said both departments felt airlines should be judged
under the same antitrust standards as all other industries.
    The Transportation Department is due to lose its authority
in 1989, but subcommittee chairman Howard Metzenbaum wants it
shifted now because he feels the Department has approved too
many airline mergers.
    "Airline mergers have proceeded at a breakneck pace with
barely a whimper being uttered by the Department of
Transportation. Nine airlines control 94 per cent of the
market," the Ohio Democrat said.
    Metzenbaum said he was concerned about the effects the
pending U.S.-Air-Piedmont Airlines merger would have on
service, especially at Dayton, Ohio, a major Piedmont hub.
    Scocozza said even with the recent mergers, such as Texas
Air Corp's acquisition of Eastern Air Lines and People Express,
more airlines were flying now in the United States than before
the 1978 airline deregulation act.
    "Airline deregulation has worked, is working, and, given
the department's commitment to preserving a competitive
environment, will continue to work," Scocozza said.
    He said the department considers the effect each merger
will have on competition over all the routes involved and will
not approve a merger which will reduce competition.
    Scocozza said most of the recent mergers involved airlines
in financial difficulty being taken over by other carriers.
     Andewelt said he was optimistic competition would increase
as airlines expanded airport hubs and routes and believed the
industry did not need special treatment under antitrust laws.
    "It is time to treat the airline industry in precisely the
same way as other U.S. industries; any differences are not
significant for the purpose of merger analysis," Andewelt said.

The administration is expanding its
crackdown on bad debts, officials of the White House Office of
Management and Budget (OMB) told reporters.
    OMB Deputy Director Joseph Wright said the administration
this year plans to turn over to private credit rating firms
data on about 3.5 mln "deadbeats" who are seriously behind or in
default in their payments on federal loans.
    Next year, the government will turn over to private
collection bureaus four billion dlrs in bad education loans and
three billion dlrs in other bad government loans, Wright said.
    The government is also considering letting individuals make
payments on their student loans with credit cards, officials
told reporters.
    The Internal Revenue Service is already studying the use of
credit cards to pay income taxes, but this usage would require
a change in federal law while no congressional action would be
needed for credit cards to be used for student loans, the
officials said.
    The officials disclosed these plans in releasing the third
annual OMB report to Congress on management of the U.S.
government.
    The report details steps to be taken by the administration
to increase federal efficiency and to continue President
Reagan's highly publicized "war on waste, fraud and abuse."
    According to the report, elinquent U.S. debt had soared to
68.3 billion dlrs, or 18.8 pct of total receivables, by the end
of the fiscal year that ended last Sept. 30. At the end of
fiscal 1981, when Reagan took office, bad debt stood at 29.8
billion dlrs or 12.3 pct of total debt.
    But OMB officials said other Reagan administration efforts
had already saved taxpayers 84 billion dlrs and would save
another 25 billion dlrs or so by the time Reagan left office.

The National Highway Transportation
Safety Administration said it granted a request by Ford Motor
Co to delay for four years until 1994 a requirement that air
bags or other passive restraint systems be installed on the
passenger side of the front seat of all new autombiles.
    Under the decision announced today by Transportation
Secretary Elizabeth Dole, automakers will be required to meet
federal passive restraint requirements only on the driver's
side. "The action we are taking today will result in the
installation of more air bags, sooner than would have occurred
without this rule," Dole said.
    Under the ruling announced today, 10 pct of model year 1987
cars must have automatic seat belts or air bags on the driver's
side. For the 1988 model year, 25 pct must have passive
restraints, and for 1989, 40 pct must be so equipped.
    By the 1990 model year, all new cars must be equipped with
passive restraint systems on the driver's side.
    For the passenger side of the front seat, ordinary seat
belts will suffice until 1994 under the new ruling. As
previously written, the federal standard required passive
restraint systems such as air bags on both the driver's and
passenger's side of the front seat in all new cars by 1990.

    Labatt's earnings rose to 92.8 mln dlrs in the nine months

Columbia Gas System Inc said a
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission decision today on natural
gas cost recovery could reduce its 1987 earnings by about 1.25
dlrs a share.
    The company said "this could bring earnings for 1987 below
Columbia's stated goal of earning no less than its 3.18 dlrs
per share dividend." It earned 2.12 dlrs a share in 1986.
    It said management expects to recommend to the board that
the dividend rate be maintained in 1987.
    Columbia Gas said the impact of the FERC decision may be
offset by a one-time accounting change rleated to future tax
liabilities under the new federal tax laws.
    The company recorded these liabilities based on older,
higher tax rates, but an action being considered by the
Financial Accounting Standards Board could result in a gain of
about 1.20 dlrs a share in 1987, it explained.
    "Thus there is a good chance that we will attain our 1987
earnings goal -- although not in the way originally planned,"
Columbia Gas said.
    Columbia Gas said the FERC decision would limit the
recovery of certain gas contract costs by Columbia Gas
Transmission Corp, the company's principal pipeline subsidiary.
    It said the decision specifically excluded from a purchased
gas adjustment filing by the pipeline costs related to
amortizing payments made to producers to reform gas purchase
contracts. These were excluded on the grounds the subsidiary
failed to sufficiently support cost recovery.
    The company said its subsidiary is not precluded from
making a new filing to provide sufficient support.

International Cocoa Organization, ICCO,
Council chairman, Denis Bra Kanon, said he will attempt to
reach a compromise on buffer stock rules for the International
Cocoa Agreement.
    Bra Kanon called for bilateral consultations among
producers and consumers Thursday morning to resolve outstanding
differences on how much non-member cocoa the buffer stock can
purchase and differentials to be fixed for different origin
cocoa, consumer delegates told reporters.
    Bra Kanon is expected to meet with about eight delegations
individually in attempt to iron out remaining problems.
    Producers and consumers indicated support "in principle" for
the draft buffer stock rules package formulated over the past
week by a small working group, consumer delegates said.
    Despite remaining differences delegates remained confident
a buffer stock accord would be agreed to by Friday when the
council session ends, but certain technical points need further
clarification, the delegates said.
    Certain consumers are concerned that differentials included
in the draft buffer stock package are out of line with market
realities, consumer delegates said.
    Unless these are modified there are fears it would promote
purchases of quality cocoas, such as Ghana origin, which are
normally required by manufacturers, they said.
    Restrictions on buffer stock purchases of non-member cocoa
might lead to a supply overhang in Malaysian cocoa, which would
depress prices, they added.

    In 1987, a total manufacturing activities will generate
about 235 mln dlrs in revenues, and engineering and

The Securities Industry Association
backed a variety of restraints on insider trading and hostile
corporate takeovers and asked Congress to define insider
trading in law.
    The industry trade association called on U.S. securities
firms to take steps to protect sensitive corporate secrets to
guard against illegal trading by employees.
    The association also backed broad federal restrictions on a
variety of tactics used in hostile corporate takeovers.
    But it said investment banking firms should be allowed to
continue to engage in both arbitrage and merger and acquisition
activities so long as those functions were kept separate.
    The SIA, in a report adopted yesterday by its board of
directors, backed a higher enforcement budget for the federal
Securities and Exchange Commission and called on U.S. stock
exchanges to beef up their supervision of member brokerages.
    The report said securities firms "should be more rigorous in
restricting sensitive information on a need-to-know basis."
    It said firms should train their employees to understand
the need for confidentiality of market-sensitive information.
    It said legislation to define insider trading should avoid
expanding current law in a way that would impede the market.
    It said an insider trading definition should exempt a
securities firm from liability for law violations by its
employees unless the firm had participated in or was aware of
the wrongdoing.
    In the mergers and acquisitions area, the association
advocated a ban on greenmail payments or poison pill takeover
protection plans without prior shareholder approval.
    It said a group or individual buying up a company's stock
should be required to file a public disclosure statement before
acquiring more than five pct of the company's shares. Under
current law, disclosure may be made as late as ten days after
exceeding the five pct limit.
    The association said all purchases exceeding 20 pct of a
company's voting stock shouls be made only through a tender
offer open to all shareholders. Under current law there is no
limit on open market purchases.
    The group said the federal government should preempt state
regulation of defensive takeover tactics.
    The group said all tender offers should remain open for at
least 30 calendar days.
    The current requirement is expressed in business days.
    It said so-called "lockup" devices, in which securities are
issued to a friendly investor to seal a takeover deal or fend
off an unfriendly predator should be limited to 18.5 pct of the
target company's total common stock.
    Association president Edward O'Brien said the group acted
out of concern over the ad hoc restructuring of corporate
America on Wall Street and investor fears about insider trading
and fairness in the marketplace.

Texaco Inc's oil and gas reserves
declined in 1986 despite reduced production and upward
revisions in the company's previous reserve estimates, its
annual report said.
    The statement of the report's auditor was qualified -- as
was the previous one -- because of the unkonwn final impact of
the judgement won by Pennzoil Co <PZL> against Texaco on
charges Texaco interfered with Pannzoil's contract to acquire
Getty Oil Co.
    The auditor's point out, as Texaco has in the past, the
company's loss of any of several pending court decisions in
this case could cause it "to face prospects such as having to
seek protection of its assets and business pursuant to the
bankruptcy and reorganization provisions of Chapter 11" of the
federal bankruptcy code.
    Commenting on a Texas Court of Appeals ruling which reduced
Pennzoil's judgement by two billion dlrs, to 9.1 billion dlrs,
Texaco said it will file a motion for a rehearing by the
appeals court no later than March 30.
    Texaco said the proven crude oil reserves of the company
and its consolidated subsidiaries totaled 2.54 billion barrels
at the end of 1986, down from 2.69 billion a year earlier.
    However, inclusion of Texaco's equity in the Eastern
Hemisphere reserves of a nonsubsidiary company limited the
decline to 2.91 billion barrels from 3.00 billion at the end of
1985.
    Worldwide production by the consolidated subsidiaries
declined to 341 mln barrels last year from 362 mln in 1985 and
upward revisions in previous reserve estimates rose to 143 mln
barrels from 117 mln, respectively.
    Texaco said the largest drop in reserves came in the United
States -- where the total dropped to 1.46 billion barrels from
1.55 billion.
    The company said U.S. liquids production averaged 660,000
barrels per day last year, down from 714,000 in 1985, with
about 44 pct of the decline -- some 24,000 barrels per day --
representing high-cost production shut-in or curtailed in
response to the decline in crude oil prices during 1986.
    Texaco said its natural gas reserves totaled 8.16 trillion
cubic feet at year end, down from 8.87 trillion cubic feet at
the end of 1985.

Southwestern Bell Corp said that
its planned acquisitions of cellular telephone and paging
systems, including those of <Metromedia Inc>, will result in
some initial earnings dilution and an increase in debt ratio.
    In a letter to shareholders in its 1986 annual report, the
regional Bell company did not indicate the degree of earnings
dilution it expects from the acquisitions, which total some
1.38 billion dlrs. However, the company said the rise in its
debt ratio will be temporary and will leave its debt level
within an acceptable range.
    In its 1986 yearend financial statement, Southwestern Bell
listed a debt-to-equity ratio of 43.4 pct, down slightly from
43.7 pct in 1985.
    In 1986, the company earned 1.02 billion dlrs, or 10.26
dlrs a share, compared with 996.2 mln dlrs, or 10 dlrs a share
in 1985. Revenues dipped to 7.90 billion dlrs from 7.93 billion
dlrs.
    Southwestern Bell said it expects the new tax law to have a
negative impact on its cash flow, due mainly to the loss of
investment tax credits.
    By mid-year, however, the company said a reduced corporate
tax rate should have a positive impact on its net income and
cash flow.
    In addition, the company said it is projecting a 1.7 pct
gain in customer telephone lines and a three to four pct
increase in long distance calling volumes.
    Southwestern Bell said 1987 capital expenditures will be
lower that the 1.97 billion dlrs spent in 1986, a year in which
expenditures were held below budget.

The director of the Office of
Management and Budget James Miller warned that a tax increase
would jeapordise real U.S. economic growth.
    "It's a bad idea. We don't need more money to balance the
budget. We need to reduce spending and avoid things that would
halt economic expansion," Miller told students at the
University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.
    "I think economic growth could be threatened mightily if we
have a tax increase or by the perception that we're giving up
on deficit reduction," he said.
    Miller criticised a proposal by House speaker Jim Wright to
put a one pct tax on securities transactions.
    He said the tax would probably be ineffective because
people would avoid by holding their portfolios in other
instruments, like real estate, or simply by not trading as
often.
    Miller said he doubted this proposal would pass.
    "I think it is frankly all but political suicide to
advocate a tax increase unless the president championed it as
well," he said. "And he's not going to do it, in fact he would
veto a tax increase," Miller added.

Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige
said the U.S. trade deficit should start to decline soon,
possibly in the figures for February or March.
    "We could see the trade deficit start down in February or

Governmental Affairs Committee.
    He predicted the trade deficit, which was 170 billion dlrs
in 1986, would decline by 30 to 40 billion dlrs in 1987 and in
1988.
    Baldrige said he was making his prediction without having
seen the February trade figures, but he said that the volume of
imports has dropped beginning with the fourth quarter of 1986
and will continue to drop in this quarter.
    The eventual turnaround in the monthly trade figures will
reflect the impact of the decline in the dollar, Baldrige said.
    Ealier, Treasury Secretary James Baker told the committee
that the trade deficit had levelled off, but Baldrige said he
was more optimistic, adding, "I think we turned the corner in
February."

U.S. soybean lobbyists and
congressional aides criticized a proposal from a senior
Agriculture Department official that Congress allow the U.S.
soybean loan level to be officially lowered to 4.56 dlrs per
bushel next year.
    "I don't know who in Congress would propose that happening.
Politically it would be totally unacceptable," an aide to a
senior farm-state senator said.
    USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz said this week that
Congress should give USDA authority to keep the soybean loan 
at its current effective rate of 4.56 dlrs per bushel rather
than increasing it to its minimum allowed level of 4.77 dlrs.
    "I'm convinced that Congress will not go along with this,"
American Soybean Association President Dave Haggard said.
    Amstutz told reporters following a senate hearing that if
the soybean loan rate were 4.56 dlrs, USDA could then consider
ways to make U.S. soybeans more competitive.
    His comments were seen as possibly indicating what the  the
administration's position is in the debate over what should be
done to make soybeans competitive and at the same time protect
soybean farmers' income.
    Using soybean specific certificates to further buydown the
loan rate or implementation of a marketing loan have been
pointed to as the most effective ways to get soybean prices
competitive. USDA secretary Richard Lyng, however, continues to
maintain his opposition to a marketing loan, saying such a move
would be too costly.
    "There will be alot of other options that will be
considered before Congress looks at that one (the Amstutz
proposal," said Bill O'Conner, aide to Rep. Edward Madigan
(R-Ill), ranking minority leader of the Agriculture Committee.
    "Anybody representing large groups of soybean producers
would not be very excited about supporting a lower soybean
loan," O'Conner said.
    Congress may very likely look at the soybean loan and
decide that they cannot increase it from its current 5.02 dlr
basic rate, but that there has to be something mandated to
increase soybean's competitiveness, David Graves, aide to Sen.
Thad Cochran (R-Miss) said. Cochran, a staunch supporter of a
soybean marketing loan, would support a soybean loan of 5.02 or
4.77 dlrs with a certificate buydown, Graves said.

Kansas City Southern Industries Inc
said it is ready to promptly purchase the Southern Pacific
Transportation Co from Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp <SFX> if
the Interstate Commerce Commission rejects Sante Fe's attempt
to reopen the merger of Southern and the Atchison, Tokepa and
Santa Fe Railway.
    In a filing with the ICC late today, the company outlined
four conditions of its offer to acquire Southern Pacific.
    Among the conditions are that Santa Fe enter into an
agreement to indemnify Kansas City for any contigent liabilites
of Southern Pacific existing as of the closing date, and that
the financial condition of Southern remain largely unchanged
from today onward.
    "We are willing, even eager, to make a fair market value
offer in cash for the Southern Pacific," said Kansas City
Southern president and chief executive officer Landon H.
Rowland.
    "This offer disproves the constant derogation of the
Sourthern Pacific by SFSP management, best exemplified by SFSP
Chief Executive John Schmidt's comment in ICC hearings that the
Southern Pacific was 'bankrupt,'" said Rowland.
    He said that merging Southern with Kansas City will achieve
the benefits of an end-to-end merger while preseving the
independece of the Southern Pacific versus its existing prime
competitor, Santa Fe.
    Kansas said that Southern's management had estimated the
value of the railroad in 1983 in the range of 281 mln dlrs to
1.2 billion dlrs.
    It said that Morgan Stanley and Co Inc and Salomon Brothers
Inc, hired in 1983 to advise Southern and Santa Fe in their
merger, appraised Southern as worth between 500 mln dlrs and
800 mln dlrs less than Southern's own internal valuations.
    Kanasa City Southern said it will make an offer for
Southern after its books, records and properties are examined.
    "Once that examination has been completed (and even in the
absence of a willingnes of SFSP to negotiate) KCSI will make an
offer in writing...." said the company.
    Kansas also said it argued in the ICC filing that Santa Fe
had not met the legal requirements justifying the Commission's
reconsideration of the proposed merger of Santa Fe and Southern
Pacific, two railroads that it said basically parallel each
other throughout their routes.
    ICC voted four to one last summer to reject the merger as
inherently anticompetitive. Kansas said Santa Fe in petitioning
for reconsideration now argues that the trackage agreements
with the Union Pacific, the Denver and Rio Grande Western and
other railroads, adds to the value of the merger.

Unocal Corp said it intends to
increase its spending for capital projects to 929 mln dlrs in
1987, eight pct more than the 862 mln spent in 1986.
    The company said in its annual report that it would
increase spending for exploration and development of petroleum
resources by about three pct to 614 mln dlrs from 1986's 595
mln dlrs, assuming oil prices hold around current levels.
    The planned spending for exploration and production in 1987
remains well below the 1.1 billion dlrs spent in 1985, Unocal
said.
    The company's proved developed and undeveloped reserves of
crude oil rose slightly in 1986, Unocal said. Net crude oil and
condensate reserves were 752 mln bbls as of Dec 31, 1986,
compared to 751 mln bbls at the end of 1985, Unocal said.
    The company said its net crude oil and condensate
production averaged 248,200 barrels per day in 1986 compared to
251,300 bpd in 1985.
    Unocal said its worldwide natural gas reserves were 6.07
billion cubic feet in 1986 compared to 1985's 6.19 billion. Net
natural gas output averaged 976 mln cubic feet per day in 1986,
down 10 pct from 1985's 1,084 mln, the company said.
    Unocal said its average sales prices for crude oil was
12.67 dlrs a barrel worldwide in 1986 compared to 23.81 dlrs in
1985, and its average sales price for natural gas was 2.03 dlrs
per thousand cubic feet in 1986 against 2.24 dlrs in 1985.
    Average production costs for crude oil and natural gas
declined nearly 30 pct to 3.41 dlrs per bbl of oil equivalent
in 1986 from 4.81 dlrs in 1985, Unocal said.
    In the annual report, the company called for imposition of
an oil import fee by the U.S. government to set a floor price
of about 25 dlrs a barrel for crude oil.
    "Simply stabilizing prices at about 18 dlrs per barrel    
will not materialy slow the drop in U.S. production or the rise
in imports," Chairman Fred Hartley said in the annual report.
    "Without decisive action in Washington, this nation will
once again become a hostage to OPEC's plans and policies,"
Hartley said.

Varity Corp, earlier reporting a full
year loss against a prior year profit, said improvement is
expected in the balance of fiscal 1987 as new products fill the
inventory pipeline, cutbacks in operating costs are realized
and its newly acquired Dayton Walther business is fully
integrated.
    However, operating results are likely to remain under
pressure in the first quarter ending April 30, it said.
    Varity earlier reported a loss for fiscal 1986 ended
January 31 of 23.3 mln U.S. dlrs, compared to a year-earlier
profit of 3.9 mln dlrs.
    Varity said continued deterioration in major markets, a
weakening U.S. dollar and unforeseen delays in launching major
new lines of tractors contributed to the full year loss.
    Industry demand for farm machinery continued to erode
during the latest fiscal year, with worldwide industry retail
sales of tractors sliding more than 10 pct below last year's
depressed levels, the company said.
    However, Varity increased its share of the global tractor

Blizzard conditions in parts of the
west and southwest U.S. severely stressed beef cattle and
Kansas cattlemen are reporting death losses from the storm,
according to livestock associations in the area.
    Talk among futures traders that cattle had died from the
cold and blowing snow accounted for some of the strength in
Live Cattle futures at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange today.
    "Death (of cattle) can be directly attributed to the storm,
but it's hard to get a handle on a number," Todd Domer,
director of communications for the Kansas Livestock Association
said.
    Domer noted that limited reports have been filtering in of
death losses at feedyards and from grazing and cow/calf
operations. Western Kansas was hardest hit while Eastern Kansas
only had rain, he said.
    Paul Johnston of the Nebraska Livestock Feeders Association
said, "There's no question that baby calves coming in that kind
of blizzard are probably not going to make it."
    We were having such a nice winter and the cows were out
calving before the storm hit, he added.
    The worst part of the storm came through the center of the
state. Precipitation was generally in the form of wet snow and
some feedlots are already like "soup", he said, inhibiting
cattle movements.
    The storm also had an effect on weight gain of larger
animals. Drifting snow caused problems in moving feed and mud
made it hard for cattle to reach the feed once it was
available.
    Domer noted that feedyards sources say a tremendous cutback
has occurred in feed consumption by cattle in the yards, which
may or may not lead to sickness over the next several days.
Cattle reduced daily feed consumption to about 12 lbs from 25
during the worst of the blizzard, he said.
    Mud will be more a problem as the weather breaks and snow
melts. Mud adds to stress on full-grown animals and endangers
smaller ones which can fall and be trampled in pens. The cost
of feeding rises as animals generally consume more in cold
weather, Domer said.
    Domer said it will be at least 10 days before yards get
back to normal.
    Roy Gallant, from Accu Weather Services, said that although
the worst of the storm is over, there are still some strong
gusty winds which will not diminish until tonight.
    The storm started late Sunday night in West Kansas and is
just now winding down. The storm has moved into South Dakota,
parts of Minnesota and Eastern North Dakota, he said.
    Snow accumulations from the storm totaled six to 10 inches
in most sections and 12 to 18 in a few spots before moving
north. This equals 1/2 to 1-1/2 inches of water. Drifts of four
to six feet and up to 12 feet were reported, he said.
    There's a possibility of another storm brushing that region
tomorrow night and Friday, Gallant added.

Pennzoil Co said it had not yet
received any "meaningful settlement offer" from Texaco Inc but
added that the company remained willing to consider proposals
to settle the 10.2 billion dlr jury judgment it won against
Texaco.
    In its newly-released annual report to shareholders,
Pennzoil said it expected the Texas state court judgment, which
was upheld by a state appeals court on February 12, to be
upheld if appealed again.
    "To date, Pennzoil has yet to receive any meaningful
settlement offer from Texaco, though it remains open to any
realistic effort to settle the matter," Pennzoil chairman Hugh
Liedtke said in the annual report.
    Pennzoil also said it had budgeted 212 mln dlrs for capital
spending in 1987, a drop from the 233 mln dlrs spent last year.
    Proved U.S. and foreign reserves of natural gas declined to
964 billion cubic feet last year, from 1.01 trillion cubic feet
in 1985, because of a virtual halt in its exploration program,
Pennzoil said. Its crude oil reserves dropped to 140 mln
barrels from 158 mln barrels in 1985.
     The Houston-based company said it sold an average of 339
mln cubic feet of domestic natural gas each day last year, a 17
pct drop from 1985. The average sales price for gas dropped by
60 cents per mcf to 2.16 dlrs per mcf, Pennzoil said.
    U.S. crude oil and gas liquids production last year fell to
an average of 33,290 barrels per day from 34,102 barrels per
day in 1985.
    The company's total revenues in 1986 declined to 482.3 mln
dlrs, from 762.5 mln dlrs the previous year. Operating income
in 1986 fell more than 80 pct, to 38.0 mln dlrs.
    Pennzoil said its goals for 1987 included development of
its Point Arguello oilfield off the California coast, to
maintain current production levels in its Bluebell-Altamont
Field in Utah and to drill for prospects in the Gulf of
Mexico's Mobile Bay area.
    "Production should begin late in the year from the Harvest
Platform in the Santa Maria Basin offshore California," the
company said. "Pennzoil's share of this production initially
should be five thousand barrels a day, increasing to a peak of
15 thousand barrels a day, net, by 1989."
    In its sulphur business, Pennzoil said production totaled
2.1 mln long tons last year, a decline of 18 pct from 1985. The
average sales price also declined, to 138.25 dlrs per long ton
from 141.05 dlrs in 1985.
    "The long term outlook for our sulphur operations remains
bright," the company said. "We expect sulphur's pricing
structure to strengthen during the current year, probably in
the third and fourth quarters."

A senior representative of the
financially-troubled U.S. farm credit system is expected for
the first time tomorrow to ask Congress to provide assurances
that stock held by system borrowers will be guaranteed.
    Farm credit sources said Brent Beesley, president of the
Farm Credit Corporation which represents the system, will make
the request at a Senate Agriculture subcommittee hearing.
    They said Beesley would ask Congress to take some action to
assure borrowers the stock is secure. But Beesley is expected
to stop short of requesting other forms of government aid.
    Borrowers from the farm credit system hold some four
billion dlrs in system stock which could be devalued if the
mounting losses of the system persist, officials said.
    Beesley's request expected tomorrow is seen as the first
official acknowledgment from the system itself that federal aid
will be needed to guarantee the value of the stock.
    Yesterday, Jim Billington, a member of the Farm Credit
Administration board which regulates the system, said Congress
should plan to spend at least 800 mln dlrs beginning late this
year to bail-out the system.
    Congress is moving swiftly toward legislation to aid the
system. Sen. James McClure, R-Idaho, has drafted a resolution
which would put the Senate on record as guaranteeing the value
of farm credit system stock. The resolution may be brought to
the Senate floor soon, Congressional sources said.
    In addition to requesting a guarantee of borrower stock,
Beesley is expected tomorrow to endorse the creation of a
secondary market, called "Aggie-mae" by some proponents, for
the resale of farm real estate loans.
    Sources said the farm credit system will support the idea
if the system is included in the operation of the market.
    Farm credit sources said the system decided to request a
guarantee of borrower stock at a meeting this week in Denver of
the 12 presidents of farm credit system districts.
    Beesley's testimony to the Congressional hearing tomorrow
will not include any new financial forecast of system losses,
officials said.
    Chairman of the FCA, Frank Naylor, yesterday said the
system may lose as much as 1.4 billion dlrs this year.

Richard Lyng today publicly expressed doubts that the federal

target set by the  Gramm-Rudman law.
    "I don't think anyone believes we'll meet the 108 billion
dlr target," Lyng told the Virginia Farm Bureau.
    Lyng is believed to be the first top administration
official to publicly express doubts the target would be met.
    The remark was quickly disavowed by the White House Office
of Management and Budget (OMB). "His 'no one' does not include
the OMB," said spokesman Edwin Dale.
    Lyng made the remark while describing the need for the
agriculture sector to share the burden of cutbacks under last
year's Gramm-Rudman law.
    "There needs to be some reduction of some expenditures to at
least get close to the Gramm-Rudman figure," he said.
"Agriculture would not be independent from that."
     Lyng's special assistant, Floyd Gabler, said the remark
was an opinion based on Lyng's discussions with congressmen.
    "If the Secretary said that he's simply expressing an
opinion he's gotten from the progress or lack of progress on
the Hill," he said.

The House Energy and Commerce
Committee approved major trade legislation that will give

industry said the new machines would lead to rampant recording
piracy and legislation was needed to protect their rights.

Congress, eager to find budget
savings, launches a review of the U.S. Agriculture Department's
generic commodity certificate program tomorrow, amid signs USDA
and the General Accounting Office, GAO, are at odds over how
much the program has cost U.S. taxpayers.
    The GAO concluded in a preliminary report last week that
payment-in-kind, or PIK, certificates cost between five and 20
pct more than cash outlays, administration officials who asked
not to be identified said.
    USDA officials, however, took issue with the report, saying
it did not take into account storage, handling and transport
savings that accrue to the government. The GAO then decided to
re-examine the costs, sources said.
    The issue is an important one, because congressional budget
committees are known to be considering limiting the use of
certificates as a means of cutting spending.
    Agriculture Under Secretary Daniel Amstutz and GAO Senior
Associate Director Brian Crowley are set to testify before the
Senate Agriculture Committee tomorrow.
    Amstutz is expected to tell the committee that there are
uncertainties in determining the cost of certificates compared
to cash outlays, and that savings to the Commodity Credit Corp,
CCC, almost equal costs, department sources said.
    USDA estimates that it costs the government about 75 cents
to store, handle and transport each bushel of commodity put in
government storage.
    It was unclear whether the GAO, Congress' investigative
arm, would stick by its original analysis that it costs the
government more to use certificates instead of cash in farm
price and income support programs, Reagan administration
sources said.
    The GAO is expected to point out that use of
payment-in-kind, PIK, certificates has helped relieve tight
storage by moving grain that otherwise might not have been
sold.
    The testimony by Amstutz and GAO Senior Associate Director
Brian Crowley comes as congressional budget committees
intensify their efforts to pinpoint ways to cut the federal
budget deficit -- including considering limits on the use of
PIK certificates.
    The CCC issues dollar-denominated PIK certificates, or
certs, as a partial substitute for direct cash outlays to
farmers or cash subsidies to exporters. Certs can be used to
repay nonrecourse loans or exchanged for CCC commodities or
cash.
    Between April and December 1986, CCC issued 3.8 billion
dlrs worth of certificates, according to USDA. Up to another
6.7 billion dlrs worth could be issued between January and
August 1987, according to USDA.
    Certs can cost the government more than cash primarily
because recipients can use the certificates to pay back
government loans at levels below the loan rate.
    Eliminating this practice, called "PIK and roll," would save
the government 1.4 billion dlrs between 1988-92, according to
the Congressional Budget Office, CBO. That estimate, according
to a CBO official, was based on an assumption that certificates
cost the government about 15 pct more than cash payments.
    The Senate and House Budget Committees are known to be
considering curbs on PIK-and-roll transactions among other
savings alternatives.
    The GAO last week reached the tentative conclusion that the
estimated three billion dlrs of certificates redeemed to date
have cost the federal government between 150 mln and 600 mln
dlrs, or between five and 20 pct, more than cash outlays, one
administration official said.
    However, the GAO has decided to reassess those estimates
based in part on USDA criticism, department officials said.
    The broad range of the cost estimate is partly attributable
to the different effect certificates can have on market prices
over the course of a crop year.
    USDA's Economic Research Service, for example, has found
that between June and August last year, the 215 mln bushels of
corn exchanged for certificates lowered the price of corn by
between 35 and 45 cents per bushel.
    Between September and November, however, certificates had
only a marginal impact on corn prices, according to the ERS
study, obtained by

France's right-wing government now
expects to raise about 40 billion francs this year from its
privatisation program, 10 billion more than it targetted, Prime
Minister Jacques Chirac said.
    The success of the program, launched late last year, meant
the government would be able to go beyond the 30 billion franc
figure it estimated in its 1987 budget, he said in a television
interview.
    About 75 pct of the additional revenue would be used to cut
state debt and 25 pct to provide additional funds for public
sector investment, he said.
    Chirac said Finance Minister Edouard Balladur proposed to
make two billion francs of supplementary funding available for
a five biillion franc accelerated motorway building program.
    The remaining three billion francs for this would come from
a motorway loan now in the domestic market.
    Balladur also proposed to make some extra cash available to
the French national railways, SNCF, for the construction of
high-speed rail track, and to boost research in the aerospace
industry, he added.
    An estimated 15,000 jobs would be generated by speeding up
motorway construction, Chirac said.
    Reaffirming his long term strategy of cutting the state
sector deficit and easing taxes, Chirac repeated government
pledges to cut the corporate tax rate to 42 pct from 45 pct in
the 1988 budget.
    Personal income tax would also be reduced but details had
still to be worked out, he added.
    The government aimed to make France the leading economic
power in Western Europe within five years, he told his
television interviewer.

The Glass-Steagall Act separating
banking and securities activities in the U.S. is all but dead
following decisions by federal and state authorities, the
chairman of Bankers Trust Co asserted.
    "There are plainly nails in the coffin of Glass-Steagall,"
Alfred Brittain said in remarks prepared for delivery to a
meeting of bank and financial analysts.
    He noted the Federal Reserve Board is due to decide Bankers
Trust's application for a subsidiary that can underwrite
certain securities.
    Brittain said New York State bank regulators have welcomed
applications for affiliates of New York-chartered banks which
could underwrite corporate securities. And he said a U.S. Court
of Appeals upheld Bankers Trust's commercial paper business.
    He said eventually the financial services industry will see
fewer but bigger companies drawn from the ranks of the present
commercial banks, investment banks and conglomerates.
    On another topic, Britain called for a redefinition of the
role of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
    "I think we should return to the original purpose of FDIC
insurance -- to protect small despositors and not depository
institutions themselves," Brittain said.
    He suggested banks be permitted to offer both insured
deposits and uninsured deposits. High quality assets would be
segregated to back up insured deposits.
    He said big banks could then fail without draining the
insurance funds. "Stockholders could be wiped out, management
rmemoved and uninsured creditors could take their fair share of
any losses," he said. But insured deposits under 100,000 dlrs
would be protected.

The shareholders of Illinois
Cooperative Futures Co voted to dissolve the 26-year-old firm,
the futures trading arm of 85 farm cooperatives, its president
said.
    Thomas E. Mulligan, president of the board of directors,
said 87 pct of the 61 members voting favored dissolution.
    The directors recommended the move, citing falling volume
and higher costs, when it called a special shareholders meeting
last month.
    Mulligan said the cooperative would continue operating
until April 24, when the member cooperatives will have to begin
clearing their futures trades through other companies.
    Mulligan said one of the members, Farmers Commodities of
Des Moines, Iowa, was attempting to organize a new cooperative
to replace Illinois Coop as a clearing company.
    Sources close to Farmers Commodities confirmed its plans,
but Hal Richards, president, could not be reached immediately
for comment, and it was unknown how many cooperatives might be
willing to band together.
    Industry sources said Farmers Commodities would face a
difficult task in setting up a new clearing organization by
April 24, the day Illinois Cooperative will be dissolved.
    They would have to obtain commitments from a sufficient
number of cooperatives to meet minimum capital requirements,
obtain trading memberships, and set up the office mechanisms to
handle futures trading.
    In the meantime, commercial clearing firms have been
courting the individual coops, trying to obtain their business
with low trading rates.
    If Farmers Commodities is unable to set up a clearing
organization by April 24, individual members will find other
homes, and they're unlikely to change clearing firms a second
time, one industry source said.
    The demise of Illinois Coop was set in motion by the
withdrawl of Growmark, Inc., the largest member with more than
70 pct of the capital stock, according to sources within the
cooperative.
    Mulligan acknowledged prior to the vote that Growmark had
no need to belong to the cooperative since it became affiliated
last year with Archer Daniels Midland.
    But he said Illinois Cooperative would still have been able
to meet minimum capital requirements without Growmark.
    The vote to dissolve the organization was met with "a
certain amount of pang," he said. "But in the final analysis,
the decision has to be economic, not emotional."

Treasury Secretary James Baker said
he stood by the Paris agreement among leading industrial
nations to foster exchange rate stability around current
levels.
    "I would refer you to the Paris agreement which was a
recognition the currencies were within ranges broadly
consistent with economic fundamentals," Baker told The Cable
News Network in an interview.
    "We were quite satisfied with the agreement in Paris
otherwise we would not have been a party too it," he said.
    Baker also noted the nations agreed in the accord to
"co-operate to foster greater exchange rate stability around
those levels."
    He refused to comment directly on the current yen/dollar
rate but said flatly that foreign exchange markets recently
tended "to draw unwarranted inferences from what I say."
    Baker was quoted on British Television over the weekend as
saying he has no target for the U.S. currency, a statement that
triggered this week's renewed decline of the dollar.
    "I think the Paris agreement represents evidence that
international economic policy co-ordination is alive and well,"
Baker said.
    The Treasury Secretary stressed however it was very
important for the main surplus countries to grow as fast as
they could consistent with low inflation to resolve trade
imbalances.
    He added that Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker
has also "been very outspoken" in suggesting main trading
partners grow as fast as they can.
    Baker noted that the J-curve, the delayed beneficial effect
of a weakening of a currency on that country's trade balance,
takes 12 to 18 months to work its way through to the trade
deficit and it is now 18 months since the Plaza agreement to
lower the dollar's value.
    He also said improvements in the trade deficit should come
from other sources besides the exchange rate, and pointed out
the administration's package to improve U.S. Competitiveness
was now before Congress.

international economic policy, Baker said "there's really no

Congress would enact some spending cuts. "The minute you say

Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita
said a further yen rise would have adverse effects on the
Japanese economy.
    He told Japanese business leaders the Bank of Japan will
continue to take adequate measures, including market
intervention, to stabilize exchange rates if necessary, in
close cooperation with other major industrialized nations. He
said the current instability of exchange rates will not last.
    Six major nations - Britain, Canada, France, Japan, the
U.S. And West Germany - agreed in Paris last month to act
together to hold currencies stable.
    Sumita said the Bank of Japan will continue to pursue
adequate and flexible monetary policies while watching economic
and financial developments in and outside Japan.
    He said the decision to cut the discount rate on February
20 was a hard choice for the Bank because monetary conditions
had already been sufficiently eased.
    To prevent a resurgence of inflation, the Bank will take a
very cautious stance regarding developments stemming from easy
credit conditions, he said.
    He said the latest discount rate cut to 2.5 pct should
stabilize exchange rates and expand domestic demand.
    Commenting on the dollar's fall below 150 yen, Sumita
reiterated he cannot find any specific reason for the
currency's weakness.
    The market undertook speculative dollar selling by reacting
to overseas comments by monetary authorities and trade tension,
he said.

recover in the latter half of the 1987/88 fiscal year ending

AG's <LING.F> world group turnover rose to 518.6 mln marks in
the first two months of 1987, 5.2 pct more than in the same

    But world group incoming orders fell 2.2 pct to 587.3 mln
marks, Meinhardt told the annual news conference. Excluding
exchange rate movements, world group turnover rose 8.9 pct and
incoming orders increased 1.0 pct.
    Linde expects satisfactory results and increased sales this
year but Meinhardt gave no detailed forecast. Domestic group
1986 net profit rose to 105.79 mln marks from 80.71 mln.
    Meinhardt said domestic group turnover rose 6.7 pct to
394.1 mln marks in the first two 1987 months against the same
period last year but incoming orders fell 5.2 pct to 456.6 mln.
    Linde will ask shareholders at the annual meeting on May 13
to raise authorised share capital by a maximum 30 mln marks
nominal for the issue of share warrant bonds with a maximum
issue volume of 200 mln marks. Linde's authorised share capital
currently stands at a nominal 49.6 mln marks.
    Meinhardt said the authorisation would give the company the
necessary flexibility in case Linde needed additional funds for
acquisitions. He declined to give further details.
    While world group turnover rose 7.2 pct to 3.88 billion
marks in 1986, incoming orders were barely changed at 3.91
billion marks. Meinhardt said without the sharp appreciation of
the mark against major trading partner currencies, incoming
orders would have been four pct above the prior year's level.
    World group turnover in heavy plant construction rose 7.4
pct to 777 mln marks, but incoming orders dropped 5.7 pct to
739 mln marks in the wake of the dollar and oil price plunge.
    World sales for technical gases rose 5.1 pct to 1.05
billion marks and incoming orders gained 5.2 pct to 1.05

the refrigeration sector, with particularly strong turnover and
order gains in Austria, Italy and Norway. World group sales in
the sector fell 2.5 pct to 493 mln marks, but incoming orders
rose 2.5 pct to 513 mln marks.

    Money market sources said the surprise announcement might
herald a quarter percentage point cut in the central bank
intervention rate from the 7-3/4 pct level set March 10, but
they added such a cut was relatively unlikely.
    The intervention rate was cut from eight pct on March 10
after being raised from 7-1/4 pct on January 2 to head off
speculative pressure against the franc.
    Dealers said market fundamentals could justify a further
easing, but a combination of technical factors and renewed
currency uncertainties surrounding the dollar had put
short-term upside pressure on interest rates in recent
sessions.
    Call money rose yesterday to 7-7/8 eight pct from 7-3/4 7/8
pct. Today it was first indicated at 8-1/8 1/4 before easing on
news of the tender to 7-13/16 7/8 pct.
    Technical factors making for a slight shortage of liquidity
in the market included the settlement yesterday of the latest
monthly treasury tap stock tender, on March 5, market sources
said.

British Petroleum Co Plc <BP.L> said it
intended to make a tender offer for the 45 pct of Standard Oil
Co <SRD.N> it does not already own at 70 dlrs a share cash, for
a total of 7.4 billion if the offer is fully accepted.
    The offer would be made through its <BP North America Inc>
unit and was intended to commence not later than April 1. The
offer would not be conditional on any minimum number of shares
being tendered.
    BP said in a statement the 70 dlr a share price was based
on its own valuation as well as those of its financial
advisers. It took into account reviews of both public and
non-public information.
    Standard closed in New York last night at 64-7/8 dlrs, down
1-3/4 dlrs.
    BP shares dropped on the announcement to 877p from 888p at
last night's close.
    About a third of the cash payable would be met from BP's
own resources.
    The remainder would come from new borrowings, partly from
banks under a four-year committed revolving credit facility and
partly from a a new U.S. Dlr commercial paper programme. The
company said it was in the course of arranging these
facilities.
    BP Chairman Sir Peter Walters said that the group's
investment in Standard was its largest single asset. Full
ownership would enable investment and operating decisions to be
made without the limitations of a minority interest.
    BP also believed the acquisition represented the optimum
use of its financial resources. It was confident oil prices
were likely to remain within a range sufficient to justify the
investment.
    Walters added that it also felt that, due to management
changes in 1986, Standard could now operate successfully even
in a lower oil price environment.
    Standard's net assets at end-1986 were 7.02 billion dlrs
and in the year it reported a loss of 1.08 billion dlrs before
tax and before an extraordinary item of 608 mln dlrs.
    Analysts said that the move by BP had come as a surprise.
One noted that it was not immediately clear why the group
should spend so much money buying a company it already
controlled.
    BP could also have bought up the remainder of Standard
shares considerably cheaper had it moved six months ago.
    It was also unclear what effect the tender would have on
the U.K. Government's recent announcement that it intended to
dispose of its remaining 31.7 pct stake in BP sometime in the
1987/88 financial year, analysts said.
    Analyst Paul Spedding of brokers Kleinwort Grieveson noted
that any effect on the government sale of its stake in BP would
depend on the reaction of the markets.
    The deal would probably push BP's gearing up to around 59
pct from 20 pct currently, he said.
    However, with the likelihood that oil prices would not
repeat last year's rapid drop the prospects for Standard
returning to profitability this year -- and BP benefitting from
its cash flow -- were good.
    Standard was a high cost oil producer, the analysts noted.
    Spedding noted that it needed about 12 dlrs a barrel to
make money, and at about 15 dlrs a barrel revenue from
production and its downstream activities would push it
comfortably into surplus.
    BP initially took a stake in Standard following the
discovery of oil in Alaska's Prudhoe bay in 1969. BP had
inadequate distribution facilities in the U.S. While Standard,
which was strong on marketing and refining, was short on crude
oil.
    The analysts said that BP had promoted a major management
reorganisation of Standard in the past year.
    The probability that much of the shake-up at Standard was
now complete was one possible factor behind the timing of the
tender offer, Spedding said.
    BP's willingness to take hard decisions such as major
balance sheet write offs and the sale of assets had been well
received in the markets.
    The lower costs that should now be possible -- especially
after the rationalisation of the loss making minerals division
-- should allow the benefits of an oil price recovery to come
straight through to 1987 profits without being cut back by
other sectors.

Hoechst AG <HFAG.F> said in a
statement it increased its pretax profits in 1986 despite a
fall in turnover due to lower foreign sales.
    The lower sales were due to the fall in the dollar and
other currencies against the mark. Other factors were pressure
on selling prices because of a sharp fall in the prices of
crude oil and petrochemical raw materials and the sale of
polystyrene business in the U.S. And Netherlands.
    World group pretax profit rose to 3.21 billion marks in
1986 from 3.16 billion in 1985, with sales falling to 38.01
billion from 42.72 billion.
    Within group turnover, foreign sales fell to 27.18 billion
marks in 1986 from 31.92 billion in 1985, a drop of 14.9 pct.
    The statement made no mention of net profit figures.
Hoechst will announce its dividend proposal on April 23.
    In the first quarter of this year sales were hit by the
cold weather at the start of the year. If the dollar continues
at present low levels, 1987 sales will again be below the
previous year, although in volume terms they are unchanged from
1986, Hoechst said.
    Sales of paints and dyes, fibres, sheeting and information
technology all rose in 1986 but plant construction sales fell.
    Hoechst attributed its good results to the performance of
the parent company, other units in West Germany, and to
<American Hoechst Corp>.
    Improved earnings in the U.S. Largely reflected the
restructuring of styrene and polystyrene activities.
    Roussel Uclaf <RUCF.PA> and most domestic non-consolidated
partners did not perform as well as in 1985.
    Hoechst attributed the 12 pct rise in parent company pretax
profits to 1.82 billion marks above all to a rise in earnings
from interest and holdings in other companies, and a fall in
extraordinary costs.
    The fall in raw material prices was not enough to
compensate for the decline in turnover due to lower prices and
currencies, Hoechst said.
    The bulk of the 2.53 billion marks investment in new
projects, up from 294 mln marks in 1985, went on the capital
increase of Hoechst Capital Corp in connection with the
acquisition of <Celanese Corp>.
    Celanese was merged with American Hoechst in February to
form <Hoechst Celanese Corp>.

BP International and BP North America
are seeking a five billion dlr, four year syndicated credit
facility in support of British Petroleum Co Plc's tender offer
for the 45 pct of Standard Oil Co it does not already own,
Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of New York said as arranger.
    The facility, to be guaranteed by British Petroleum Co Plc
<BP.L> is probably the largest credit facility ever arranged in
Europe, bond analysts said. Full terms will be announced either
later today or tomorrow morning. BP said earlier it planned a
tender offer for the 45 pct of Standard it does not already own
for 70 dlrs a share cash.
    The financing being arranged by Morgan Guaranty will take
the form of a fully committed revolving credit. As announced
earlier, BP also is arranging a U.S. Commercial paper program
in connection with the tender and part of the revolver will be
used to support that program.
    The exact size of the U.S. Program has not been decided and
the dealers have not yet been chosen.
    The credit facility will also allow the borrower to issue
cash advances with maturities of one, three or six months
through a tender panel, which will be comprised of banks
committed to the facility.
    Despite the unprecedented size of this euromarket facility,
Morgan Guaranty said that it was being syndicated only among
BP's relationship banks.
    As a result, banks were being offered lead manager status
at 200 mln dlrs, co-lead management at 125 mln and manager at
75 mln.
    Although pricing on many credit facilities has become
extremely fine in recent years because of the keen competition
to win mandates, Morgan Guaranty said banks would be
compensated fairly since this is a special purpose facility
which must be completed quickly, with signing expected in about
10 days.

West Germany's current account
surplus widened to a provisional 6.6 billion marks in February
from a slightly downwards revised 4.8 billion in January, a
spokeswoman for the Federal Statistics Office said.
    The trade surplus in February widened to a provisional 10.4
billion marks from 7.2 billion in January, she added.
    The Statistics Office had originally put the January
current account surplus at 4.9 billion marks.
    The February trade surplus was well up on the 6.84 billion
mark surplus posted in the same month of 1986. But the current
account surplus was down slightly from the 6.85 billion surplus
recorded in February 1986.
    A Statistics Office statement said the widening of the
February current account surplus compared with January was due
to seasonal factors. Neither the trade nor current account
figures are seasonally adjusted.
    February imports, measured in terms of value, totalled
32.11 billion marks, a decline of 10 pct against February 1986
but a rise of 5.5 pct against January.
    Exports in February, also in value terms, totalled 42.56
billion marks, 0.5 pct less than in February 1986 but up 13 pct
compared with January.
    The Statistics Office said it was not yet able to calculate
the real change in exports and imports in February. But for
comparison purposes it noted that in January the average value
of imports had fallen 15 pct year-on-year while the average
value of exports had declined by only 4.4 pct.
    Within the current account, the services account had 300
mln marks deficit, supplementary trade items a 200 mln mark
surplus while transfer payments posted a 3.7 billion mark
deficit.
    Taking the first two months of 1987 together, imports in
value terms fell 14 pct to 62.6 billion marks compared with a
year earlier. The value of exports totalled 80.2 billion marks,
a decline of 7.4 pct against the same months of 1986.
    The resulting trade surplus of 17.6 billion marks for
January/February compares with a cumulative surplus of 14.1
billion marks in the year-ago period.
    The cumulative current account surplus for January and
February 1987 totalled 11.3 billion marks against 11.4 billion
marks a year earlier, the Statistics Office said.
    Bank economists said the rise in the February trade surplus
reflected an improvement in the terms of trade as well as
seasonal factors. The Federal Statistics Office said earlier
this week that February import prices fell 0.7 pct against
January while export prices were unchanged.
    "The rise in the nominal figures masks a lower export trend
that is not expected to change for several months at least,"
said an economist. He said the nominal trade surplus for 1987
as a whole is likely to fall only slightly from the record
112.2 billion marks in 1986 but other economists said the
surplus could fall to around 80 billion marks.
    An economist at the Bank fuer Gemeinwirtschaft (BfG) in
Frankfurt said a two-month comparison of trade figures gave a
more accurate picture of West Germany's trade position.
    He noted the 17.6 billion mark surplus for January and
February together was lower than the 21.6 billion mark surplus
posted in November and December.
    "The trend is clearly lower," he said.
    This economist, who declined to be named, said the February
rise was also partly explained by special factors in January,
when there had been a number of public holidays as well as
extremely cold weather, both of which hindered trade.

World group turnover of Siemens AG
<SIEG.F> should rise to 51 or 52 billion marks in the current
year to September 31 after a 19 pct upturn in the first five
months, management board chairman Karlheinz Kaske said.
    Siemens reported world group turnover in 1985/86 of 47.02
billion marks.
    Kaske told the annual shareholders meeting turnover rose to
21.2 billion marks in the first five months of 1986/87, about
19 pct above the same year-ago period. The rise was mainly due
to payment in January for a West German nuclear power station
which led to a jump in domestic sales of 36 pct.
    In the first five 1986/87 months, turnover abroad showed a
three pct increase, Kaske said, without giving figures.
    In the same period incoming orders rose five pct to 21.8
billion marks against the same 1985/86 period.
    For the year as a whole incoming orders should rise between
one and two billion marks to around 51 or 52 billion.
    Apart from payments for the nuclear power station, the
communications and telecommunications sectors in particular
should contribute to growth this year, Kaske said.
    But it was not possible to make a profit forecast for
1986/87 because of uncertainty about the direction of the
dollar, Kaske said.
    Siemens already reported that first quarter 1986/87 group
net profit fell marginally to 296 mln marks from 298 mln in the
same period in the previous year.
    Turnover in the first five months rose particularly
strongly in the installations and automotive technology,
communications and telecommunications sectors, but components
and energy and automation showed a sharp decline.
    Kaske said domestic orders rose to 10.2 billion marks in
the first five months of this year, or nine pct above their
level in the same 1985/86 period, boosted in particular by
orders for the fully owned Kraftwerk Union AG subsidiary.
    Foreign orders grew one pct to 11.6 billion marks. An
increase in orders through newly acquired subsidiaries abroad
was balanced by the decline in the dollar.
    While the installations and automotive technology sector
showed a sharp rise in orders, energy and automation and
communications orders were below the level achieved in the same
period of 1985/86.
    Telecommunications orders remained at roughly the same
level.
    Kaske said investments were expected to remain around six
billion marks in 1986/87 after a 50 pct increase the previous
year. Research and development were likely to rise 13 pct to
6.1 billion marks or around 12 pct of turnover.

The Fried. Krupp GmbH
<KRPG.D> steel and engineering group said it had a satisfactory
1986 despite a provisional 12 pct fall in total group sales to
18.1 billion marks from 20.7 billion the previous year.
    Third party turnover declined to 15.9 billion from 18.5
billion in 1985 while orders slipped to 15.5 billion marks from
16.9 billion, it said in a preliminary statement.
    Despite these figures, which reflected the dollar's
weakness against the mark and oil and raw materials price
falls, it said 1986 was a satisfactory year.
    The reason was the continued expansion of the machinery and
plant sector, which accounted for 42 pct of total sales.
    Krupp added that some areas of the mechanical engineering
business achieved notable growth rates and acquisitions had
underpinned machinery and component activities.
    An orders decline in the steel and, in particular, the
trading and services sectors, affected the group's total order
figures.
    However, "all business sectors contributed to the positive
results achieved in 1986," Krupp added, without giving details.
    Domestic orders decreased by five pct to 9.6 billion marks
from the previous year and foreign orders fell 14 pct to 5.9
billion, it said. Foreign business accounted for 38 pct of
orders against 40 pct in 1985.
    Orders received by the machinery and plant sector, 11
member companies which comprise the core area of the group,
rose by four mln marks last year to 6.9 billion, Krupp said.
    The group's orders in hand amounted to 9.1 billion marks at
end-December 1986 from 10.3 billion at the start of the year.
    Orders received by the steel sector last year decreased by
three pct to 6.2 billion marks from 1985, it said.
    The steel market weakened increasingly over the year,
mainly because of exchange rate movements, the deterioration in
foreign trade and a downturn in a number of customer
industries.
    The difficult market for sections and flats of quality
steel depressed order tonnages by around seven pct, Krupp said.
But special steel boosted by strong demand for stainless
cold-rolled flats, grew by five pct in tonnage terms.

Firms need not be pessimistic about export
prospects even though foreign markets have become more
difficult because of the mark's strength the Economics Ministry
said.
     The ministry's parliamentary state secretary Ludolf Georg
von Wartenberg, told a business conference German exports could
start rising again in real terms during 1987, reversing the
lower export trend which emerged in mid-1986.
    But even if the turnaround did not occur, there would be no
need to worry about the economy as long as the weakness of
exports did not affect currently good domestic demand.
    Von Wartenberg said consumer demand remained quite good but
noted there had been a cooling in the investment climate. "This
is certainly a reason for heightened watchfulness but not for
stimulative steps," he said.
    The best way for Bonn to help its exporters is to work
actively to promote free world trade, he added.
    Von Wartenberg said the economy still had good export
opportunities. Price alone was not the only factor in
international competitiveness, he said, adding German firms
have a reputation for high quality standards, prompt delivery
times and good service.
    Von Wartenberg said the government was in a difficult
position on its trade figures.  It faced international pressure
to reduce its trade surplus, but West Germans were worried
about the effect of the mark's strength on the country's
exporters.
    Reports about the trade surplus, especially overseas,
tended to concentrate on nominal trade figures, which rose to a
record 112.2 billion marks in 1986, he said. But this rise was
due entirely to the lower value of imports caused by the
decline of both the dollar and oil prices. German exports have
in fact been falling in real terms for sometime, he said.

Britain's visible trade deficit narrowed
to a seasonally adjusted provisional 224 mln stg in February
from 527 mln in January, The Trade and Industry Department
said.
    The current account balance of payments in February showed
a seasonally adjusted provisional surplus of 376 mln stg
compared with a surplus of 73 mln in January.
    Invisibles in February were put provisionally at a 600 mln
surplus, the same as in January.
    Seasonally adjusted, imports rose in February to 7.16
billion stg from 6.73 billion in January. Exports rose to a
record 6.93 billion last month from 6.20 billion in January.
    Trade Department officials said the improvement in
Britain's current account contrasted with most private
forecasts and they attributed much of the strength to imports
rising less quickly in February than might otherwise have been
expected.
    The Department said exceptionally cold weather in January
reduced exports that month and that there had been an element
of catching up in the February figures.
    The seasonally adjusted volume index, base 1980, a guide to
underlying non-oil trade, showed exports rising to 131.0 from
114.6 in January and imports rising to 142.2 from 136.5.
    The value of British oil exports in February rose to 751
mln stg from 723 mln in Jnauary while oil imports rose to 425
mln from 352 mln.
    The Department said the upward trend in non-oil export
volume continues and the underlying level of non-oil import
volume seems to have stablised.
    The Departnment said exports to the U.S. May be benefiting
from fluctuations in the mark and yen exchange rates.

The release of U.K. February trade data
showing that the current account surplus was a provisional 376
mln stg, up from a 73 mln surplus in January, has boosted hopes
of an early cut in interest rates, analysts said.
    Market forecasts had been for a worse outcome, with
expectations of a deficit in visible trade averaging about 750
mln stg, against the official figure of 224 mln stg, sharply
narrower than January's 527 mln deficit.
    "The figures are unreservedly good," Chase Manhattan
Securities economist Andrew Wroblewski said.
    Sterling rebounded on the trade figures, reversing a weaker
morning trend, to stand at 72.1 pct of its trade weighted index
against a basket of currencies at midday, unchanged from
yesterday's close but 0.3 points above the 1100 GMT level.
    The market had feared that a deteriorating non-oil trade
pattern would undermine international support for sterling,
which has been the motor behind the recent fall in U.K.
Interest rates. Money market sources said the market had begun
to doubt that a widely expected drop in bank base lending rates
to 9.5 pct from the present 10.0 pct was really on the cards.
    But sentiment now looks to have turned about again.
    There now looks to be no danger that the Chancellor of the
Exchequer Nigel Lawson's forecast of a 1987 current account
deficit of 2.5 billion stg will be exceeded, Wroblewski said.
    Seasonally adjusted figures showed imports rose in February
to 7.16 billion stg from 6.73 billion in January.
    Exports rose to a record 6.93 billion from 6.20 billion.
    However, Chris Tinker, U.K. Analyst at brokers Phillips and
Drew said the faster rise in exports than imports would prove
partly aberrational in coming months. He forecast the
Chancellor's Budget tax cuts would increase consumer
expenditure on imported goods.
    However, Warburg Securities economist Ian Harwood said his
firm was sharply revising its 1987 current account deficit
forecast in the light of the latest data, cutting one billion
stg off the expected full year total to about 1.75 billion stg.
    He said news of strong growth in exports of non-oil goods
confirmed recent bullish surveys among members of the
Confederation of British Industry.
    The growth in imports appears to be flattening, even if
January's bad weather had curbed consumer spending on overseas
goods and import-intensive stock building among manufacturers,
Harwood said.
    U.K. Government bonds, or gilts, surged by more than 1/2
point on the better-than-expected news, as earlier worries
about the figures evaporated.
    Sterling peaked at a high of 1.6075 dlrs, before settling
to a steady 1.6050 about 1300 GMT, nearly a cent higher than
the European low of 1.5960.
    However, analysts noted that the turnabout in market
sentiment still looks highly vulnerable to political news.
    Morning weakness in sterling and the gilt market was
largely attributed to a newspaper opinion poll showing that the
Conservative government's support was slipping.
    LONDON, March 26 - The Bank of England said it provided 15
mln stg in assistance to the money market this morning, buying
bank bills in band two at 9-13/16 pct.
    Earlier the Bank revised its money market liquidity
forecast from a flat position to a deficit of around 350 mln
stg.

U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker
said that he opposes a Federal tax increase to help reduce the
budget deficit and favors spending cuts instead.
    "I don't think it's (a tax increase) is a very good idea
and I'm quite confident that President Reagan doesn't think
it's a very good idea," Baker said in an interview on Cable
News Network's "Moneyline" television program.
    He said U.S. taxpayers are taxed at a rate of 19 pct of GNP
which is traditionally where it has been, but the Federal
Government is spending at a rate of 24 pct of GNP. Baker said
spending cuts are clearly the best way to cut budget deficits.
    Baker said he opposed a stock transactions tax proposed by
House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Tex, or other special taxes.
    "The stock transfer tax would be a particularly unfortunate
approach to take," the Treasury Secretary said. He said the
United States has some of the most efficient capital markets in
the world and new taxes would impair efficiency.
    On the international front, Baker said banks must do more
lending to developing countries. He was questioned about this
after the Standard and Poor's Corp downgrading today of the
debt of six major money center bank holding companies, largely
because of their heavy developing nation loan exposure.
    Baker said that developing countries must adopt free market
economic policies such as in the United States. He said capital
flows will be required to support the needed reforms in the
economic systems of those countries.
    The money must come either through equity or debt and Baker
said that developing nations' "investment regimes do not
support enough equity investment, so you've got to have some
debt there."
    Commenting on the U.S. trade deficit, Baker said "I think
you're going to see a 15 to 20 billion dlr reduction this
year."

Treasury Secretary James Baker said
he stood by the Paris agreement among leading industrial
nations to foster exchange rate stability around current
levels.
    "I would refer you to the Paris agreement which was a
recognition the currencies were within ranges broadly
consistent with economic fundamentals," Baker told The Cable
News Network in an interview.
    "We were quite satisfied with the agreement in Paris
otherwise we would not have been a party too it," he said.
    Baker also noted the nations agreed in the accord to
"co-operate to foster greater exchange rate stability around
those levels."
    He refused to comment directly on the current yen/dollar
rate but said flatly that foreign exchange markets recently
tended "to draw unwarranted inferences from what I say."
    Baker was quoted on British Television over the weekend as
saying he has no target for the U.S. currency, a statement that
triggered this week's renewed decline of the dollar.
    "I think the Paris agreement represents evidence that
international economic policy co-ordination is alive and well,"
Baker said.
    The Treasury Secretary stressed however it was very
important for the main surplus countries to grow as fast as
they could consistent with low inflation to resolve trade
imbalances.
    He added that Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker
has also "been very outspoken" in suggesting main trading
partners grow as fast as they can.

interview with the Cable News Network. "I'm not going to change

    But Baker did say Volcker has "done a tremendous job" and
added they get on "extremely well", both when he was White House
chief of staff and during his term at Treasury.
    When asked whether he differed with Volcker on
international economic policy, Baker said "there's really no
difference of opinion between us with respect to these matters."
    In other comments, Baker said he did not think a tax rise
was a good idea and nor did President Reagan. But he believed
Congress would enact some spending cuts. "The minute you say
raise taxes, all restraints on spending go by the board."
    He once again pointed out that taxes were 19 pct of gnp but
spending was at 24 pct, a statistic he used to argue strongly
for spending cuts.

The price of gold bullion is likely
to rise in the second half of the year on increased private
investor demand, West German analysts said.
    Gold could rise as high as 500 dlrs per ounce later this
year, said Peter Witte, director of Westdeutsche Landesbank
Girozentrale's trading division, after a presentation by the
U.S. Mint to promote its gold and silver Eagle series coins.
    "A lot will depend on oil prices and developments on stock
exchanges," Witte said, adding he saw gold positioned for
further rises once it breaks out above 450 dlrs.
    Gold was fixed this morning in London at 411.30 dlrs.
    Despite current strong interest in gold mine stocks, many
investors still want to buy physical gold, Witte said.
    Interest in gold mine stocks may also wane if stock
exchange rallies under way in many countries start to waver.
    Hermann Strohmeyer, vice president of Commerzbank AG's
foreign exchange trading and treasury department, said gold is
poised to rise to 460 to 470 dlrs an ounce in the second half
of this year.
    The price is unlikely to fall much below 380 or 390 dlrs an
ounce, and probably will continue in a range between 380 and
430 dlrs in the first half of this year, he said.

First Interstate Bancorp <I> would
benefit from new banking capital adequacy rules proposed by the
Federal Reserve Board, Chairman Joseph Pinola said.
    "We are one of the few banks that would have an improved
position," Pinola said in an interview, noting First Interstate
has fewer off balance sheet liabilities than many other banks.
    Under the proposed rules, a bank's minimum capital
requirement would be determined by the assessed risk of their
assets, including off balance sheet liabilities that are not
currently taken into account.
    Currently, banks must retain a primary capital ratio of 5.5
pct.
    First Interstate reported a primary capital ratio of 6.14
pct at the end of 1986.
    Pinola said First Interstate has since raised that ratio,
however, to about 6.70 pct, through a recent preferred stock
offering and a 200-mln-dlr subordinated capital note offering
announced yesterday.
    First Interstate reported a relatively average return on
assets ratio of 0.68 at the end of 1986.
    Pinola said First Interstate's return on assets ratio will
improve to the 0.70-0.71 range at the end of the first quarter,
because 1986 year-end assets, at 55.4 billion dlrs, were
overestimated by about two billion dlrs.
    He said he is anxious to improve the return on assets ratio
further, but continued loan losses at First Interstate's Rocky
Mountain state banks continue to hold down profits.
    Pinola said its banks in other states are showing excellent
return on asset ratios, with its Arizona and Washington banks
running at about 1.30, its Oregon bank showing 1.00 and its
California bank at about 0.83.

Siemens AG <SIEG.F> turnover in the
United States will rise to about 2.6 billion dlrs in the
current year to end September from 2.2 billion in 1985/86,
management board chairman Karlheinz Kaske said.
    He told the annual meeting 80 pct of last year's sales came
from products made in the U.S.. He added Siemens was as
interested as U.S. Authorities in reducing the massive trade
deficit and calming down trade relations.
    "But we would show no understanding if this (trade deficit
reduction) was attempted through means incompatible with the
principle of free world trade," Kaske said.
    Siemens has been the subject of pressure by U.S.
Telecommunications authorities to limit its access to the U.S.
Market for digital telephone switching equipment.
    The Federal Communications Commission announced in December
it was starting an enquiry into the blocking of free access to
the telecommunications market by foreign firms, with officers
saying reciprocal access was not available to U.S. Firms
abroad.
    For years Siemens was the only supplier of public switching
stations to the Bundespost, the German federal post office.
Regulatory authorities in 1982 opened Bundespost contracts to
tenders from other domestic and foreign suppliers.
    But foreign authorities have complained that too many
restrictions to overseas suppliers still remain.
    Kaske said neither Siemens nor the Bundespost could be held
responsible for the U.S. Trade deficit and noted the U.S. Was
still achieving substantial surpluses in trade with West
Germany in the electrical and telecommunications sector.
    The Bundespost is far more open to supplies from abroad
than telephone companies in the U.S. Japan or France, he added.

Britain's visible trade deficit narrowed
to a seasonally adjusted provisional 224 mln stg in February
from 527 mln in January, The Trade and Industry Department
said.
    The current account balance of payments in February showed
a seasonally adjusted provisional surplus of 376 mln stg
compared with a surplus of 73 mln in January.
    Invisibles in February were put provisionally at a 600 mln
surplus, the same as in January.
    Seasonally adjusted, imports rose in February to 7.16
billion stg from 6.73 billion in January. Exports rose to a
record 6.93 billion last month from 6.20 billion in January.
    Trade Department officials said the improvement in
Britain's current account contrasted with most private
forecasts and they attributed much of the strength to imports
rising less quickly in February than might otherwise have been
expected.
    The Department said exceptionally cold weather in January
reduced exports that month and that there had been an element
of catching up in the February figures.
    The seasonally adjusted volume index, base 1980, a guide to
underlying non-oil trade, showed exports rising to 131.0 from

cash.
    The company said at the time of the acquisition, its assets
will include only lithium and ferrosilicon operations. Foote,
which is 83 pct owned by Newmont Mining Corp <NEM>, has signed
a letter of intent to sell its Cambridge operations and said it
is in talks on the sale of its manganese operations with
several companies.  Foote said Newmont has informally indicated
it would vote in favor of the Rio Tinto proposal.
    Foote said terms of the agreement, including price for the
proposed cash transaction, have not been released because they
are subject to a continuing due diligence investigation.
    The company said a definitive merger agreement is expected
to be negotiated within six weeks and shareholders are expected
to vote on the deal at a meeting expected to be held in June or
July.
